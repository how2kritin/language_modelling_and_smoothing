235.2218503265037
Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	20.845056264772417
A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air.	80.96017274684321
He held the bowl aloft and intoned: — _Introibo ad altare Dei_.	43.00107162829665
Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: — Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit! Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.	64.238971309121
He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains.	56.169985047421974
Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head.	77.66507372291699
Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.	62.326775516299506
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.	60.20382216460975
— Back to barracks! he said sternly.	214.3933359119851
He added in a preacher ’ s tone: — For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns.	46.10347261660243
Slow music, please.	94.65046406518275
Shut your eyes, gents.	16.269760498798608
One moment.	127.31511872973628
Silence, all.	292.7380823193444
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points.	35.28742258004567
Chrysostomos.	1218.4197832253003
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.	67.45270292254162
That will do nicely.	69.07484854562186
Switch off the current, will you?	41.96066418685638
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown.	35.18226945301682
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.	26.857835868005456
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.	42.36220657015883
— The mockery of it! he said gaily.	375.2122582827917
Your absurd name, an ancient Greek! He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself.	54.454240114160726
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.	64.49460927984016
Buck Mulligan ’ s gay voice went on.	76.90524726287691
— My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.	51.97230739456763
But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn ’ t it?	54.92405626659335
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.	59.99818642272072
We must go to Athens.	246.33585500026174
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?	23.230467749630872
He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried: — Will he come?	437.2903936467399
The jejune jesuit! Ceasing, he began to shave with care.	34.00165402099059
— Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.	266.7048009630674
— Yes, my love?	438.92885355768226
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.	65.86845695836733
— God, isn ’ t he dreadful?	543.5183318579402
he said frankly.	590.7557259961703
A ponderous Saxon.	328.45820040497097
He thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	123.44854831252566
God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion.	29.35724024348854
Because he comes from Oxford.	59.31062154392241
You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner.	101.00402527931182
He can ’ t make you out.	589.714813010299
O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife - blade.	86.17776287061368
He shaved warily over his chin.	155.96287746245977
— He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.	85.27900261183449
Where is his guncase?	1367.4448419892005
— A woful lunatic! Mulligan said.	156.6862246160067
Were you in a funk?	313.4807849483609
— I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.	117.28106440273288
Out here in the dark with a man I don ’ t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther.	45.53074035291561
I ’ m not a hero, however.	65.75074157735531
If he stays on here I am off.	37.675899889768
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.	235.22640842408398
He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.	30.63668502927949
— Scutter! he cried thickly.	222.57967302465605
He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen ’ s upper pocket, said: — Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.	42.77000932194831
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief.	135.9299330197298
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.	27.798170639443697
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said: — The bard ’ s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.	56.81303571601909
You can almost taste it, can ’ t you?	215.31697596315135
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.	100.5903736817043
— God! he said quietly.	359.32490491486675
Isn ’ t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother?	49.85113604426074
The snotgreen sea.	431.89385738317617
_Epi oinopa ponton_.	129.53949124709393
Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you.	283.63506052883764
You must read them in the original.	85.98551312921681
_Thalatta! Thalatta! _ She is our great sweet mother.	122.94997613807337
Come and look.	141.86859743508506
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.	333.11217250923704
Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.	126.65308123443334
— Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.	54.56223478090152
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen ’ s face.	98.82476563175028
— The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.	130.18044126661977
That ’ s why she won ’ t let me have anything to do with you.	59.398023023635496
— Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.	177.0385607456316
— You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said.	224.1476494011825
I ’ m hyperborean as much as you.	70.98193244872138
But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her.	53.44918816168881
And you refused.	42.59319510256639
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.	29.86237430525952
A tolerant smile curled his lips.	58.838140874655
— But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself.	86.30255141710876
Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all! He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.	61.8384074576598
Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat - sleeve.	67.41949401817836
Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.	71.23959208453844
Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	29.049251874008494
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.	37.146396269193175
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.	28.50821312248339
A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.	15.710640813382952
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.	33.05778230848619
— Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice.	228.73459079510067
I must give you a shirt and a few noserags.	78.21433324334359
How are the secondhand breeks?	194.51139090328113
— They fit well enough, Stephen answered.	88.06014161776335
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.	27.954519370607958
— The mockery of it, he said contentedly.	442.1377094467086
Secondleg they should be.	102.81717122389176
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey.	99.57401588754172
You ’ ll look spiffing in them.	142.54565613904077
I ’ m not joking, Kinch.	45.226388046223036
You look damn well when you ’ re dressed.	150.80623644742514
— Thanks, Stephen said.	221.64612872963696
I can ’ t wear them if they are grey.	186.7322087827669
— He can ’ t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.	221.02560458616537
Etiquette is etiquette.	112.77067707425105
He kills his mother but he can ’ t wear grey trousers.	107.67132799424881
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes.	54.06720247130272
— That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g.	187.7281741014833
p.	646.6883228950286
i.	1218.4197832253003
He ’ s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.	88.3262053472003
General paralysis of the insane! He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.	36.14365426852386
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.	124.82546947403779
Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.	31.02581174204193
— Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack.	133.47265978891372
Hair on end.	99.36980170887733
As he and others see me.	44.1975097414908
Who chose this face for me?	122.21269980843135
This dogsbody to rid of vermin.	35.43608041714104
It asks me too.	102.5160426579277
— I pinched it out of the skivvy ’ s room, Buck Mulligan said.	510.05261992292736
It does her all right.	46.012253088219055
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.	37.53437403943941
Lead him not into temptation.	54.73149252798042
And her name is Ursula.	146.88201007677114
Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen ’ s peering eyes.	857.9792286829627
— The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.	70.38608250464544
If Wilde were only alive to see you! Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness: — It is a symbol of Irish art.	32.19251208527608
The cracked lookingglass of a servant.	118.06610195826866
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen ’ s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.	90.62702538433128
— It ’ s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?	279.7674289202616
he said kindly.	414.45324763594283
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.	44.59411182732882
Parried again.	303.54355099264353
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.	77.78842387955554
The cold steel pen.	200.6704597605985
— Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea.	100.91813761358372
He ’ s stinking with money and thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	72.6726308534163
His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.	20.616552131801956
God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island.	180.4367397962686
Hellenise it.	275.5388195470069
Cranly ’ s arm.	65.65369031715241
His arm.	976.5087734151514
— And to think of your having to beg from these swine.	92.81388535856871
I ’ m the only one that knows what you are.	83.01310067647279
Why don ’ t you trust me more?	210.4179728518734
What have you up your nose against me?	62.53018184941994
Is it Haines?	71.69783386626705
If he makes any noise here I ’ ll bring down Seymour and we ’ ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.	20.501185505728802
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe ’ s rooms.	39.31982895302526
Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.	40.58430051749786
O, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor ’ s shears.	47.38573409910854
A scared calf ’ s face gilded with marmalade.	116.96570206585926
I don ’ t want to be debagged! Don ’ t you play the giddy ox with me! Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.	42.034461803517765
A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold ’ s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.	21.831717729579967
To ourselves...	287.51741061989503
new paganism...	80.68514862521712
omphalos.	1218.4197832253003
— Let him stay, Stephen said.	67.84843925196759
There ’ s nothing wrong with him except at night.	68.64406504158619
— Then what is it?	108.61668590656387
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.	61.31610619220716
Cough it up.	688.3984515546226
I ’ m quite frank with you.	60.57981333283606
What have you against me now?	126.29238706369595
They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.	52.25275714640184
Stephen freed his arm quietly.	217.84818122301488
— Do you wish me to tell you?	364.1242245665868
he asked.	72.62503664047722
— Yes, what is it?	150.36835395094172
I don ’ t remember anything.	127.19429677066825
He looked in Stephen ’ s face as he spoke.	154.78915807100665
A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.	25.157671020010646
Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said: — Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother ’ s death?	75.72339524661832
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: — What?	48.53694475567178
Where?	2503.021043628515
I can ’ t remember anything.	355.60383288709414
I remember only ideas and sensations.	73.31974119087226
Why?	2421.489910325178
What happened in the name of God?	367.0830491367243
— You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water.	170.7276439742329
She asked you who was in your room.	811.581988539962
— Yes?	2592.6619381671294
Buck Mulligan said.	204.09243346666068
What did I say?	1822.2314746829395
I forget.	2221.315314178943
— You said, Stephen answered, _O, it ’ s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly <URL> A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan ’ s cheek.	26.97661655006297
— Did I say that?	437.596479984164
he asked.	72.62503664047722
Well?	391.76746557714245
What harm is that?	145.3269836823528
He shook his constraint from him nervously.	99.98934955910126
— And what is death, he asked, your mother ’ s or yours or my own?	295.1397110601002
You saw only your mother die.	121.65682252747472
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.	52.22704965721406
It ’ s a beastly thing and nothing else.	51.81823753373723
It simply doesn ’ t matter.	177.32763163430582
You wouldn ’ t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.	148.62255889521325
Why?	2421.489910325178
To me it ’ s all a mockery and beastly.	93.75823698112396
Her cerebral lobes are not functioning.	36.15667863429321
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt.	25.857239948753396
Humour her till it ’ s over.	119.2082357767274
You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don ’ t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette ’ s.	32.479725508641316
Absurd! I suppose I did say it.	160.37581232858003
I didn ’ t mean to offend the memory of your mother.	53.44904213057296
He had spoken himself into boldness.	80.9994502800308
Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly: — I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.	73.38290036572725
— Of what then?	386.9212842157
Buck Mulligan asked.	73.58938619238297
— Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.	185.9865399451257
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.	132.60824501211374
— O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.	113.05566902446502
He walked off quickly round the parapet.	621.0760883594908
Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.	51.508067664281405
Sea and headland now grew dim.	23.813158575575002
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.	100.73977779183049
A voice within the tower called loudly: — Are you up there, Mulligan?	163.03830240275826
— I ’ m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.	132.77360711865967
He turned towards Stephen and said: — Look at the sea.	159.11441644396606
What does it care about offences?	38.09004925547332
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.	68.40581987479896
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof: — Don ’ t mope over it all day, he said.	114.70242640111306
I ’ m inconsequent.	224.40083206289455
Give up the moody brooding.	311.7048557714714
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead: And no more turn aside and brood Upon love ’ s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars.	28.59822477464682
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed.	59.11720425428591
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.	17.61036611411916
White breast of the dim sea.	172.06316266025843
The twining stresses, two by two.	63.24278691063595
A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords.	20.50559298452157
Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.	84.93955208008907
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green.	18.78399274079378
It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.	67.5731170224356
Fergus ’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.	94.71614548031904
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.	63.959736759655144
Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside.	75.65920326340837
She was crying in her wretched bed.	92.74746391648031
For those words, Stephen: love ’ s bitter mystery.	111.24413076356622
Where now?	1865.8567304597657
Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.	11.179999758065026
She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang: I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility.	33.52555851581117
Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.	28.15725206358101
And no more turn aside and brood.	131.57267631229863
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys.	315.73100364135064
Memories beset his brooding brain.	40.66534266626026
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament.	47.477040996925865
A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.	55.74375455752244
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children ’ s shirts.	91.16655086892315
In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	25.56476386682726
Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.	34.41889701016253
On me alone.	587.1273668605618
The ghostcandle to light her agony.	88.36699940577297
Ghostly light on the tortured face.	189.40340230036412
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees.	12.922959266936127
Her eyes on me to strike me down.	52.72006081122432
_Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus <URL> Ghoul! Chewer of corpses! No, mother! Let me be and let me live.	27.5735003992342
— Kinch ahoy! Buck Mulligan ’ s voice sang from within the tower.	69.96934156370678
It came nearer up the staircase, calling again.	31.63573076937302
Stephen, still trembling at his soul ’ s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.	123.59710355828868
— Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.	637.9663325721754
Breakfast is ready.	112.85545663410916
Haines is apologising for waking us last night.	17.36776886621755
It ’ s all right.	80.87154829755536
— I ’ m coming, Stephen said, turning.	178.16320844086047
— Do, for Jesus ’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.	166.7333464908216
For my sake and for all our sakes.	34.72500786816724
His head disappeared and reappeared.	18.792466152105867
— I told him your symbol of Irish art.	127.44760950604969
He says it ’ s very clever.	230.2916473341993
Touch him for a quid, will you?	132.0634402898573
A guinea, I mean.	441.04132024684696
— I get paid this morning, Stephen said.	408.12531601803903
— The school kip?	309.6918051735359
Buck Mulligan said.	204.09243346666068
How much?	87.84085099296325
Four quid?	116.09826509251334
Lend us one.	152.96766399645426
— If you want it, Stephen said.	179.3476560483103
— Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight.	53.634750753441836
We ’ ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.	38.583247173167884
Four omnipotent sovereigns.	56.5222700052377
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent: O, won ’ t we have a merry time, Drinking whisky, beer and wine! On coronation, Coronation day! O, won ’ t we have a merry time On coronation day! Warm sunshine merrying over the sea.	23.786544422735346
The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet.	79.18843293422202
Why should I bring it down?	167.74430531633584
Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?	223.5103048760008
He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.	71.7735848236161
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.	16.343630683066603
I am another now and yet the same.	157.5484112878962
A server of a servant.	136.8475339442835
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan ’ s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow.	41.59998455117668
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.	18.981970829823986
— We ’ ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.	295.7898452986705
Haines, open that door, will you?	19.30935513479115
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.	268.4795239946047
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.	40.46647290365598
— Have you the key?	684.0685032991402
a voice asked.	149.10886501527224
— Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.	493.0201409218534
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.	26.05659559550125
Haines stood at the doorway, looking out.	228.66515738053542
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait.	99.21892735711937
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him.	98.43667266806847
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.	23.762164385515213
— I ’ m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...	163.07541966271484
But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.	19.613037908113395
Haines, come in.	74.00731760363611
The grub is ready.	190.45733202126465
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.	136.3335047472088
Where ’ s the sugar?	575.7524202224673
O, jay, there ’ s no milk.	241.0658616995077
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker.	128.3729189073849
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.	182.48572192505927
— What sort of a kip is this?	301.9197096697294
I told her to come after eight.	94.5043160128555
— We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.	65.72878344976905
There ’ s a lemon in the locker.	282.7931052977219
— O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said.	63.75145140656129
I want Sandycove milk.	186.98847044394773
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly: — That woman is coming up with the milk.	69.58651771472847
— The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair.	72.59372602193959
Sit down.	88.12145439390241
Pour out the tea there.	70.35585126399603
The sugar is in the bag.	484.79082142476625
Here, I can ’ t go fumbling at the damned eggs.	157.49407842319292
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying: — _In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus <URL> Haines sat down to pour out the tea.	54.455608413153435
— I ’ m giving you two lumps each, he said.	168.4588625128812
But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don ’ t you?	143.9549379415148
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman ’ s wheedling voice: — When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.	34.7082763070117
And when I makes water I makes water.	61.60060426149638
— By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.	149.63608124222014
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: — _So I do, Mrs Cahill, _ says she.	70.30803450405173
_Begob, ma ’ am, _ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don ’ t make them in the one <URL> He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.	23.592861652945498
— That ’ s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines.	307.72097662538897
Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum.	43.153697655607395
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.	517.7292817380359
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows: — Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan ’ s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?	96.12300083869253
— I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.	712.8364195462058
— Do you now?	1621.463208422092
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.	911.7220957381511
Your reasons, pray?	119.24513742684348
— I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion.	128.23850823599187
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.	36.54101281380593
Buck Mulligan ’ s face smiled with delight.	72.88467241193617
— Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly.	78.80480366238156
Do you think she was?	74.30355763105246
Quite charming! Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: _ — For old Mary Ann She doesn ’ t care a damn.	31.0765328609101
But, hising up her petticoats... _ He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.	26.33825947070398
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.	51.368182016690156
— The milk, sir! — Come in, ma ’ am, Mulligan said.	116.83048017474384
Kinch, get the jug.	112.6879216646217
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen ’ s elbow.	56.02696632529437
— That ’ s a lovely morning, sir, she said.	231.98476562809012
Glory be to God.	62.66666227687846
— To whom?	641.2543324032013
Mulligan said, glancing at her.	138.2588238736226
Ah, to be sure! Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.	86.37739764177878
— How much, sir?	731.2310156975284
asked the old woman.	67.96822369560466
— A quart, Stephen said.	121.61988241561266
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers.	100.78441916611466
Old shrunken paps.	74.50094559707586
She poured again a measureful and a tilly.	68.019000814674
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger.	21.609913786191097
She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.	210.44874793398304
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.	44.698271687594506
They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.	39.478550933019804
Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times.	52.40442714259792
A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.	22.078151396086724
To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.	24.732414772525313
— It is indeed, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.	67.63345426980433
— Taste it, sir, she said.	1292.0162060811444
He drank at her bidding.	112.18410239480284
— If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn ’ t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.	118.20846334592204
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives ’ spits.	19.232339808508094
— Are you a medical student, sir?	166.48635281451897
the old woman asked.	69.41664706174399
— I am, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan answered.	76.18666406050085
— Look at that now, she said.	297.1050769119406
Stephen listened in scornful silence.	132.87295601936273
She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights.	60.06051815534694
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.	43.82868405239468
— Do you understand what he says?	499.9360694941654
Stephen asked her.	634.2174545525701
— Is it French you are talking, sir?	232.0854498386951
the old woman said to Haines.	129.1701533989345
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.	53.68872892494927
— Irish, Buck Mulligan said.	495.92001008364394
Is there Gaelic on you?	60.560398120923956
— I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.	925.2346087626495
Are you from the west, sir?	149.94363498599247
— I am an Englishman, Haines answered.	215.64627106562827
— He ’ s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.	329.72087700097865
I ’ m told it ’ s a grand language by them that knows.	61.98052865487191
— Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.	343.9942291259394
Wonderful entirely.	110.91760225142121
Fill us out some more tea, Kinch.	31.851718803918452
Would you like a cup, ma ’ am?	75.94892504805748
— No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.	147.44987253214035
Haines said to her: — Have you your bill?	692.6701538453135
We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn ’ t we?	32.81913614469512
Stephen filled again the three cups.	125.98084549778116
— Bill, sir?	1369.094587145081
she said, halting.	605.7601800571055
Well, it ’ s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling.	17.152431030974064
That ’ s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.	49.81165197261106
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.	14.263849547934646
— Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.	170.73014004432144
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk.	29.877532294518392
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried: — A miracle! He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying: — Ask nothing more of me, sweet.	50.30449266420568
All I can give you I give.	155.73555528642254
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.	95.38842540212414
— We ’ ll owe twopence, he said.	735.1352663832522
— Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.	176.9923288347437
Time enough.	100.87329948387531
Good morning, sir.	114.55284854021748
She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan ’ s tender chant: _ — Heart of my heart, were it more, More would be laid at your <URL> He turned to Stephen and said: — Seriously, Dedalus.	39.97307974939107
I ’ m stony.	224.40083206289455
Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money.	27.492839628923598
Today the bards must drink and junket.	26.82270050981934
Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.	21.759425463115996
— That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.	98.04251261047757
— Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.	55.40983143529816
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: — Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?	179.90543556275279
Then he said to Haines: — The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.	146.5014919377189
— All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.	79.48927223135269
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke: — I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.	135.7605887806274
Speaking to me.	86.96779051423636
They wash and tub and scrub.	76.16954254700165
Agenbite of inwit.	8.092764491240722
Conscience.	1218.4197832253003
Yet here ’ s a spot.	149.9837606167195
— That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.	47.79767277257113
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen ’ s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone: — Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.	61.10129162020625
— Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.	820.8202356175625
I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.	133.5353059925376
— Would I make any money by it?	61.06494125771901
Stephen asked.	470.01027702798706
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said: — I don ’ t know, I ’ m sure.	60.979183480797204
He strolled out to the doorway.	318.385854364795
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour: — You put your hoof in it now.	20.631148373009825
— Well?	3981.2249895622926
Stephen said.	1030.5290426386453
The problem is to get money.	1042.5805117209122
From whom?	243.63101631033572
From the milkwoman or from him.	26.683468185390055
It ’ s a toss up, I think.	107.38236457794363
— I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.	74.9710296733944
— I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.	173.60695599659704
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen ’ s arm.	22.66837036010087
— From me, Kinch, he said.	2756.112679700026
In a suddenly changed tone he added: — To tell you the God ’ s truth I think you ’ re right.	113.18895163737253
Damn all else they are good for.	50.6277783429288
Why don ’ t you play them as I do?	211.94879378947246
To hell with them all.	139.08902513284528
Let us get out of the kip.	278.46960709666985
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly: — Mulligan is stripped of his garments.	87.23316895100206
He emptied his pockets on to the table.	270.7984245489668
— There ’ s your snotrag, he said.	692.8160304809619
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.	76.24712940956154
God, we ’ ll simply have to dress the character.	89.74494510100715
I want puce gloves and green boots.	61.26334247861096
Contradiction.	1218.4197832253003
Do I contradict myself?	67.0645330387342
Very well then, I contradict myself.	177.20985903500863
Mercurial Malachi.	327.3813759060568
A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.	170.3179595449769
— And there ’ s your Latin quarter hat, he said.	343.7685089543486
Stephen picked it up and put it on.	167.1640022868731
Haines called to them from the doorway: — Are you coming, you fellows?	88.6778226662725
— I ’ m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.	117.57313625104835
Come out, Kinch.	91.67383881897617
You have eaten all we left, I suppose.	172.68788322481666
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow: — And going forth he met Butterly.	29.32895332086427
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it.	58.47865077510104
He put the huge key in his inner pocket.	112.37643328690625
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked: — Did you bring the key?	129.73559583632243
— I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.	824.7345627636325
He walked on.	165.38702106079992
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.	11.916520896749066
— Down, sir! How dare you, sir! Haines asked: — Do you pay rent for this tower?	68.85101383938365
— Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.	224.56037520352274
— To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.	54.90398486542335
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last: — Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.	52.67251280739605
Martello you call it?	74.58172650730138
— Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea.	100.65215226142136
But ours is the _omphalos_.	210.52890708620131
— What is your idea of Hamlet?	233.97609972586056
Haines asked Stephen.	73.49538177932187
— No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.	506.611154634908
I ’ m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up.	146.5386068972695
Wait till I have a few pints in me first.	72.39325093102822
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat: — You couldn ’ t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?	54.1517573930619
— It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.	71.0949359143781
— You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.	74.09624741651825
Is it some paradox?	51.21624658498309
— Pooh! Buck Mulligan said.	382.4066040437055
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.	84.17582595308284
It ’ s quite simple.	29.53625764924117
He proves by algebra that Hamlet ’ s grandson is Shakespeare ’ s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.	79.95461814239371
— What?	1096.145065448642
Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen.	140.13428159295435
He himself?	1094.8476633113119
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen ’ s ear: — O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father! — We ’ re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines.	67.4009234387935
And it is rather long to tell.	255.614822679396
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.	118.72967164199834
— The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.	48.10265992028983
— I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore.	73.46580421788131
_That beetles o ’ er his base into the sea, _ isn ’ t it?	104.88680497868125
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak.	27.489597067150044
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.	18.481109277120478
— It ’ s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.	96.71374124370489
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.	26.42861712912518
The seas ’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.	93.09525504916128
— I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.	476.964970345478
The Father and the Son idea.	446.89046955594847
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.	105.92701976761705
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.	88.25293022913631
He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.	37.27742937634483
He moved a doll ’ s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: _ — I ’ m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.	40.197508539839745
My mother ’ s a jew, my father ’ s a bird.	103.02454814495265
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.	66.04695428348528
So here ’ s to disciples and <URL> He held up a forefinger of warning.	66.1037325557281
_ — If anyone thinks that I amn ’ t divine He ’ ll get no free drinks when I ’ m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water <URL> He tugged swiftly at Stephen ’ s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: _ — Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.	27.828134773741855
What ’ s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet ’ s breezy...	97.41170193427686
Goodbye, now, goodbye! _ He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury ’ s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.	18.860041067894436
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said: — We oughtn ’ t to laugh, I suppose.	54.081436935300104
He ’ s rather blasphemous.	357.9186535113456
I ’ m not a believer myself, that is to say.	123.34387402953436
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn ’ t it?	45.236023405231855
What did he call it?	103.02948143548325
Joseph the Joiner?	124.3365792266921
— The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.	186.51151127996584
— O, Haines said, you have heard it before?	237.831541048768
— Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.	186.31980841993212
— You ’ re not a believer, are you?	34.87107283797624
Haines asked.	135.74592384057442
I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word.	185.66300388364922
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.	27.49099759232133
— There ’ s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.	112.90207773993728
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone.	19.36774017349435
— Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.	152.56148564165795
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to.	47.11590617703009
He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.	64.32381022294942
— Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.	272.61395974557433
Either you believe or you don ’ t, isn ’ t it?	51.81328950780498
Personally I couldn ’ t stomach that idea of a personal God.	65.41582607491783
You don ’ t stand for that, I suppose?	340.91070714434505
— You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.	57.26761479121069
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side.	85.02810177868682
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.	47.36365055860191
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path.	44.75526216878086
They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.	167.48275734000757
He wants that key.	32.163163738521554
It is mine.	542.8692463750783
I paid the rent.	207.34170830996462
Now I eat his salt bread.	55.01898444264281
Give him the key too.	62.855202831937966
All.	610.9259181865984
He will ask for it.	128.63449431885917
That was in his eyes.	4151.226635171555
— After all, Haines began...	343.37065503149404
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.	49.56939840373256
— After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.	207.96872607986268
You are your own master, it seems to me.	48.821926246768086
— I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.	107.87258990574712
— Italian?	2439.6672212666463
Haines said.	179.3288837959433
A crazy queen, old and jealous.	107.27408518053716
Kneel down before me.	78.62222406189518
— And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	206.91722206246385
— Italian?	2439.6672212666463
Haines said again.	171.4916516694572
What do you mean?	587.0274025937789
— The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.	81.00298559262886
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.	25.2794470904683
— I can quite understand that, he said calmly.	843.0418798953824
An Irishman must think like that, I daresay.	361.88899391108095
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly.	61.548532738833835
It seems history is to blame.	51.07073290711863
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen ’ s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam: _ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars.	14.288206000094393
Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.	44.52172646476815
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ ’ s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.	36.902564564565914
Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.	43.47578646623189
Idle mockery.	275.29382542023205
The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael ’ s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.	46.13935728052152
Hear, hear! Prolonged applause.	23.813158575575002
_Zut! Nom de Dieu! _ — Of course I ’ m a Britisher, Haines ’ s voice said, and I feel as one.	133.4921355165661
I don ’ t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.	84.42784192895847
That ’ s our national problem, I ’ m afraid, just now.	53.879093951534365
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.	55.118006787366
— She ’ s making for Bullock harbour.	199.9278279432979
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.	128.01625779367163
— There ’ s five fathoms out there, he said.	454.3010481013335
It ’ ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one.	42.45967731455192
It ’ s nine days today.	115.16471695443877
The man that was drowned.	332.79949286499135
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite.	55.21820652685055
Here I am.	128.30790737821317
They followed the winding path down to the creek.	242.71887578784023
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.	45.25955659530353
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.	110.42975675660288
— Is the brother with you, Malachi?	339.88307517935516
— Down in Westmeath.	316.9566084787165
With the Bannons.	432.6908359483386
— Still there?	773.3302107111963
I got a card from Bannon.	140.64797900480866
Says he found a sweet young thing down there.	23.424871018334382
Photo girl he calls her.	52.95077797785125
— Snapshot, eh?	411.27454387605536
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots.	71.07563924385524
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face.	25.921976612522997
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.	22.772721253516874
Chucked medicine and going in for the army.	137.99305386816042
— Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.	423.1822162573464
— Going over next week to stew.	85.00582346666486
You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?	50.367848792919645
— Yes.	1061.8201792287966
— Spooning with him last night on the pier.	883.5423566879653
The father is rotto with money.	106.69202971062347
— Is she up the pole?	865.0314020813609
— Better ask Seymour that.	143.30240894200793
— Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.	107.41421842683256
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely: — Redheaded women buck like goats.	75.23075201266947
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.	36.061843955300326
— My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.	120.52818614353323
I ’ m the <URL> Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.	99.2190388861549
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.	176.44539101011264
— Are you going in here, Malachi?	87.99724798218567
— Yes.	1061.8201792287966
Make room in the bed.	854.1489810120262
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.	44.88612609803347
Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.	113.79463848052316
— Are you not coming in?	132.03046300838702
Buck Mulligan asked.	73.58938619238297
— Later on, Haines said.	308.47328620725773
Not on my breakfast.	79.78170568898109
Stephen turned away.	64.76747977237336
— I ’ m going, Mulligan, he said.	664.2412485544099
Stephen handed him the key.	169.34889720449945
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.	26.082488835331976
— And twopence, he said, for a pint.	4803.259530512867
Throw it there.	118.33773828344276
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.	192.27006955420453
Dressing, undressing.	88.40530891686868
Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly: — He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord.	78.2455888024744
Thus spake Zarathustra.	79.76826981558858
His plump body plunged.	177.08660789298088
— We ’ ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.	119.25975623521272
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.	24.294029999496985
Half twelve.	146.44669083029254
— Good, Stephen said.	217.68426759051403
He walked along the upwardcurving path.	270.66653922600807
Liliata rutilantium.	284.961232879843
Turma circumdet.	170.76217170975505
Iubilantium te virginum.	69.04471320096071
The priest ’ s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly.	76.97769725010055
I will not sleep here tonight.	148.190290220601
Home also I cannot go.	43.00951545166959
Turning the curve he waved his hand.	9.631233440992272
It called again.	118.10845838938381
A sleek brown head, a seal ’ s, far out on the water, round.	169.02523534407308
Usurper.	1218.4197832253003
— You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?	87.07968937428167
— Tarentum, sir.	1184.8180707000806
— Very good.	408.0356101228465
Well?	391.76746557714245
— There was a battle, sir.	505.04246681174294
— Very good.	408.0356101228465
Where?	2503.021043628515
The boy ’ s blank face asked the blank window.	97.63843089003754
Fabled by the daughters of memory.	201.1302978527823
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it.	71.11331018040882
A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake ’ s wings of excess.	95.19484949797418
I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame.	34.87792860000211
What ’ s left us then?	259.82426205696373
— I forget the place, sir.	1071.7454800134974
<NUM> B.	2055.439267225028
C.	213.99259247746502
— Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book.	334.3619996047755
— Yes, sir.	581.7927155315168
And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done <URL> That phrase the world had remembered.	53.84577177740293
A dull ease of the mind.	335.5645408330618
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear.	13.642740738625728
Any general to any officers.	33.46724641939492
They lend ear.	395.4238259973317
— You, Armstrong, Stephen said.	74.68880679910231
What was the end of Pyrrhus?	635.112125714932
— End of Pyrrhus, sir?	388.25922722962974
— I know, sir.	1219.050415454651
Ask me, sir, Comyn said.	70.6628929237671
— Wait.	3267.115689768007
You, Armstrong.	471.64182740867557
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?	112.0449180689404
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong ’ s satchel.	77.16937086928236
He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly.	27.431596162274346
Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips.	278.5946444373338
A sweetened boy ’ s breath.	383.03830477110176
Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy.	80.80339954453233
Vico Road, Dalkey.	62.200804154614865
— Pyrrhus, sir?	1429.570201622743
Pyrrhus, a pier.	206.18379762506967
All laughed.	264.450856642964
Mirthless high malicious laughter.	69.81804203787918
Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile.	22.71948440517796
In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.	30.263820596093776
— Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy ’ s shoulder with the book, what is a pier.	107.91337845237128
— A pier, sir, Armstrong said.	208.39320150335283
A thing out in the water.	1084.8195961293795
A kind of a bridge.	247.36292026728376
Kingstown pier, sir.	210.11856290144652
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning.	24.27213597643884
Two in the back bench whispered.	243.28192834526243
Yes.	1763.135277433406
They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.	36.51477836526899
All.	610.9259181865984
With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily.	46.84503637288689
Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle.	25.608010920194552
— Kingstown pier, Stephen said.	173.30659491878
Yes, a disappointed bridge.	264.23837423486026
The words troubled their gaze.	90.91107029157016
— How, sir?	1123.358448128616
Comyn asked.	275.29382542023205
A bridge is across a river.	72.15096114502302
For Haines ’ s chapbook.	412.35755837391076
No - one here to hear.	526.3038650859614
Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind.	41.11898976757079
What then?	1386.2450688890237
A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master ’ s praise.	87.66320759938786
Why had they chosen all that part?	116.37635955785066
Not wholly for the smooth caress.	199.58208310454566
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.	18.70494602446792
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam ’ s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death.	24.975964648700327
They are not to be thought away.	75.10463937947172
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted.	72.73450172437957
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were?	49.448279210142516
Or was that only possible which came to pass?	186.3977545338599
Weave, weaver of the wind.	216.5850420417159
— Tell us a story, sir.	195.95185397775677
— O, do, sir.	4966.741035268673
A ghoststory.	1047.493585384237
— Where do you begin in this?	284.9504897161566
Stephen asked, opening another book.	110.63206281927488
— _Weep no more, _ Comyn said.	133.6224463377195
— And the story, sir?	256.55387777666266
— After, Stephen said.	159.69338011134266
Go on, Talbot.	69.12281069641435
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel.	46.0091362151615
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text: _ — Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor... _ It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.	26.097358694566246
Aristotle ’ s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night.	37.264045890034645
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy.	14.221881225980063
Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind ’ s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.	26.10658953885486
Thought is the thought of thought.	70.70363595676992
Tranquil brightness.	275.29382542023205
The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms.	101.92154659142678
Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.	17.236877996666564
Talbot repeated: _ — Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves, Through the dear might... _ — Turn over, Stephen said quietly.	14.218278313877638
I don ’ t see anything.	258.80754704061025
— What, sir?	1207.3865101130425
Talbot asked simply, bending forward.	34.78377504073914
His hand turned the page over.	78.26865693491571
He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered.	137.72122410370878
Of him that walked the waves.	47.54450304000291
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer ’ s heart and lips and on mine.	36.579091247581516
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute.	43.80097854746887
To Caesar what is Caesar ’ s, to God what is God ’ s.	570.9446413930355
A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church ’ s looms.	129.23808835533256
Ay. Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.	128.43299100049427
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.	26.51858766469414
— Have I heard all?	323.91143263595865
Stephen asked.	470.01027702798706
— Yes, sir.	581.7927155315168
Hockey at ten, sir.	115.44331740552401
— Half day, sir.	100.4895740208747
Thursday.	525.8816296405445
— Who can answer a riddle?	120.22748576607107
Stephen asked.	470.01027702798706
They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.	25.08158625765068
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily: — A riddle, sir?	33.64392337280395
— O, ask me, sir.	546.6764371496782
— A hard one, sir.	384.30347246615196
— This is the riddle, Stephen said: The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven.	42.15265519888861
’ Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven.	24.638453201715098
What is that?	679.5709951112618
— What, sir?	1207.3865101130425
We didn ’ t hear.	484.06580274198825
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated.	24.25952428909879
After a silence Cochrane said: — What is it, sir?	195.83711460707542
We give it up.	1072.1831622470704
Stephen, his throat itching, answered: — The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.	69.87054897022206
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay.	33.79392444079311
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called: — Hockey! They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.	53.651131937338334
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues.	20.332231403988718
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook.	18.704319852799454
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.	15.810461537610886
On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail ’ s bed.	21.13097272997133
He held out his copybook.	158.4554476242497
The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.	159.8775926122083
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot.	23.229632303072233
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.	158.00449745089645
— Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir.	469.2143610960389
Stephen touched the edges of the book.	377.80952238080675
Futility.	1218.4197832253003
— Do you understand how to do them now?	228.5087921670911
he asked.	72.62503664047722
— Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered.	62.97630710750116
— Can you do them yourself?	601.5647584937037
Stephen asked.	470.01027702798706
— No, sir.	452.8557621728434
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail ’ s bed.	34.6955237730635
Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.	172.73937319604295
She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own.	27.645879235405015
Was that then real?	226.95643199578825
The only true thing in life?	393.18951704193023
His mother ’ s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode.	49.36453121363943
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes.	74.46735719838215
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.	30.711279828901088
A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.	27.194514101046842
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.	15.645127289112503
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare ’ s ghost is Hamlet ’ s grandfather.	99.15174176742589
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses.	28.69152873715126
Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.	78.77799525923903
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.	20.64502295273843
Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.	28.82689004314314
Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.	25.05711089724901
— Do you understand now?	634.4570183946855
Can you work the second for yourself?	54.84268515927244
— Yes, sir.	581.7927155315168
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data.	33.95124789301494
Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin.	23.777608263120047
_Amor matris: _ subjective and objective genitive.	41.92841036758367
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.	35.34154314203144
My childhood bends beside me.	35.65460503027397
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly.	65.70328166472693
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes.	14.003487575791866
Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.	18.262135433414876
The sum was done.	205.67915322512363
— It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.	124.17558902031193
— Yes, sir.	581.7927155315168
Thanks, Sargent answered.	46.41288215162829
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench.	32.05219357585419
— You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’ s graceless form.	79.5041969110497
— Yes, sir.	581.7927155315168
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.	95.12601069695503
— Sargent! — Run on, Stephen said.	122.57811193603798
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife.	52.86825355005743
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.	17.572881606437413
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him.	102.82590550633755
He turned his angry white moustache.	66.96006259589522
he cried continually without listening.	63.81403039650098
— Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.	159.624078159498
— Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here.	87.80403267450849
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man ’ s voice cried sternly: — What is the matter?	86.37602975363555
What is it now?	1298.642481568202
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.	27.260046672570834
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs.	38.519849659195565
As on the first day he bargained with me here.	165.54801328710664
As it was in the beginning, is now.	348.5235705109756
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be.	21.793097175221952
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end.	36.38133218029484
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor.	234.46805094263186
Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.	62.23130333261272
— First, our little financial settlement, he said.	143.04749493165465
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong.	68.98514387640179
— Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.	173.6242043644415
And now his strongroom for the gold.	171.03814767747548
Stephen ’ s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir ’ s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James.	53.25527374048053
An old pilgrim ’ s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.	28.382521388509023
A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.	99.72941851693628
— Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.	131.35674898369064
These are handy things to have.	29.535253913391724
See.	204.66066808253274
This is for sovereigns.	54.54784464785884
This is for shillings.	54.58490131477893
Sixpences, halfcrowns.	112.77067707425105
And here crowns.	422.57629607437417
See.	204.66066808253274
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.	49.59549379174454
— Three twelve, he said.	632.1904659901929
I think you ’ ll find that ’ s right.	326.12250987688856
— Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.	47.89069084612775
— No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said.	235.06823656300278
You have earned it.	153.5843238381478
Stephen ’ s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells.	372.1671802561504
Symbols too of beauty and of power.	74.02650229346092
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.	30.024443275975287
— Don ’ t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said.	309.1562429827367
You ’ ll pull it out somewhere and lose it.	196.18192689411813
You just buy one of these machines.	110.79900375358082
You ’ ll find them very handy.	127.85167075172595
Answer something.	203.07158957055697
— Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.	81.62972370177323
The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same.	271.95948121978853
Three times now.	99.9175651851736
Three nooses round me here.	36.535837520212766
Well?	391.76746557714245
I can break them in this instant if I will.	358.36080381414695
— Because you don ’ t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger.	197.94650656817205
You don ’ t know yet what money is.	40.83485039649047
When you have lived as long as I have.	75.66101508200899
I know, I know.	304.94915824701974
If youth but knew.	72.23915045156413
But what does Shakespeare say?	113.32590495584681
_Put but money in thy <URL> — Iago, Stephen murmured.	33.96249574993503
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man ’ s stare.	157.36127066315888
— He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said.	394.5990582653919
He made money.	50.284839385928116
A poet, yes, but an Englishman too.	827.9417007035146
Do you know what is the pride of the English?	1044.7599271035208
The seas ’ ruler.	155.39159199576596
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.	53.87358546553341
— That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.	390.25294855021025
— Ba! Mr Deasy cried.	517.2647623583443
That ’ s not English.	128.51681795234924
A French Celt said that.	109.26270301221354
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.	66.38761885937237
— I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast.	673.0640287311619
_I paid my <URL> Good man, good man.	49.52265205602669
_ — I paid my way.	101.86158003063274
I never borrowed a shilling in my <URL> Can you feel that?	45.14630088951558
_I owe <URL> Can you?	42.88356473686047
Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.	42.1236575660499
Curran, ten guineas.	90.92148119267617
McCann, one guinea.	731.1421675632943
Fred Ryan, two shillings.	57.96237912068594
Temple, two lunches.	126.43220860840525
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks ’ board.	22.140858745496335
The lump I have is useless.	160.92054186564025
— For the moment, no, Stephen answered.	626.2948763152378
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.	23.75014861826146
— I knew you couldn ’ t, he said joyously.	740.8591361685353
But one day you must feel it.	81.93939053190535
We are a generous people but we must also be just.	55.81080546067711
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.	23.152912595386915
— You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.	185.9227533417744
I saw three generations since O ’ Connell ’ s time.	307.3587769275393
I remember the famine in ’ <NUM>.	63.72503550234597
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O ’ Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue?	51.3060564574232
You fenians forget some things.	120.47683352649477
Glorious, pious and immortal memory.	27.908761806380564
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes.	17.09842027042578
Hoarse, masked and armed, the planters ’ covenant.	49.807852095529796
The black north and true blue bible.	73.20813287640829
Croppies lie down.	116.39241411885186
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.	161.9739476621139
— I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said.	206.80960736286522
On the spindle side.	156.16298051961684
But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union.	83.58284861452333
We are all Irish, all kings ’ sons.	128.30870643974214
— Alas, Stephen said.	225.0885816496309
— _Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto.	186.02461581589083
He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.	58.81613175962161
Lal the ral the ra The rocky road to Dublin.	17.992040745479027
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots.	32.29517059752455
Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!...	43.29783082961494
Day!...	38.120808431294535
Day!...	38.120808431294535
Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin.	90.14595507740185
Lal the ral the ra.	38.67606073342446
Lal the ral the raddy.	37.26935863001889
— That reminds me, Mr Deasy said.	809.0088205041034
You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends.	64.57086053383507
I have a letter here for the press.	509.95179540465523
Sit down a moment.	63.223113229128494
I have just to copy the end.	83.19190881457317
He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.	78.49332516057373
— Sit down.	683.1042139798582
Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of common <URL> Just a moment.	31.54585653955876
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.	48.897987395650425
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.	61.98372852932838
Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings ’ _Repulse_, the duke of Westminster ’ s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort ’ s _Ceylon_, _prix de Paris_, <NUM>.	32.36870185663179
Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign.	59.54324124222745
— Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys.	191.2936537243105
_But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question... _ Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush.	23.671503571127626
Even money _Fair <URL> Ten to one the field.	21.737961094009357
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher ’ s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.	22.543433608496418
Shouts rang shrill from the boys ’ playfield and a whirring whistle.	36.65166846048674
Again: a goal.	19.769940093478187
I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life.	61.55453506264449
You mean that knockkneed mother ’ s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick?	73.13325723954706
Jousts.	812.0832237234374
Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.	19.18142482982897
Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men ’ s bloodied guts.	48.22103329528682
— Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.	402.2695726647092
Stephen stood up.	330.9644865267491
— I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said.	244.67899227984964
It ’ s about the foot and mouth disease.	132.6739598143642
Just look through it.	74.02863584065962
There can be no two opinions on the matter.	87.43955671131869
May I trespass on your valuable space.	20.64768300924473

— I don ’ t mince words, do I?	343.15673894933605
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.	30.774450950283846
Foot and mouth disease.	43.64248899868026

Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.	114.03349893262576
— I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said.	343.21918857953386
You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle.	49.198314308282086
And it can be cured.	95.8719546536746
It is cured.	515.4289397367023
My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there.	19.581416187032616
They offer to come over here.	124.97144754872697

He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.	85.42202710784646
— Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said.	350.25165724873455
England is in the hands of the jews.	385.95744655885386
In all the highest places: her finance, her press.	146.5770304194379
And they are the signs of a nation ’ s decay.	190.67924410343002
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation ’ s vital strength.	113.1888110499918
I have seen it coming these years.	63.78715393939139
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.	21.537560585939552
Old England is dying.	49.424125790838396
He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam.	65.66640749991696
He faced about and back again.	290.57604579894974
— Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.	390.14839760066536
The harlot ’ s cry from street to street Shall weave old England ’ s windingsheet.	66.28793541933054
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted.	25.589893990526278
— A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?	33.15386829969749
— They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely.	505.31286432784964
And you can see the darkness in their eyes.	37.7568476617557
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day.	214.07474251972317
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers.	50.397756008753674
Gabble of geese.	112.77067707425105
They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats.	43.78695375770487
Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.	19.03818662805188
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain.	22.756597845529274
Vain patience to heap and hoard.	25.393473606158178
Time surely would scatter all.	32.06625469006704
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.	53.46110747271666
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.	16.96886177772947
— Who has not?	855.0781844942686
Stephen said.	1030.5290426386453
— What do you mean?	1174.2923420845227
Mr Deasy asked.	78.59599100037627
He came forward a pace and stood by the table.	111.62457549688929
His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly.	64.80194684061225
Is this old wisdom?	92.05760999441583
He waits to hear from me.	323.93970328875093
— History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.	51.085246431209356
From the playfield the boys raised a shout.	36.67510235515202
A whirring whistle: goal.	96.35185795344294
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?	61.90922751472511
— The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said.	151.59225869674663
All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.	42.90971971122408
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying: — That is God.	80.22404451370224
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee! — What?	32.93776456838747
Mr Deasy asked.	78.59599100037627
— A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.	92.15406425253214
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers.	64.63924414941879
Looking up again he set them free.	27.690165702580597
— I am happier than you are, he said.	286.5516905500734
We have committed many errors and many sins.	31.817305501683816
A woman brought sin into the world.	25.979181133649924
For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy.	17.18424176829616
A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough ’ s wife and her leman, O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	31.39587254199964
A woman too brought Parnell low.	16.218633122222425
Many errors, many failures but not the one sin.	23.661080695694846
I am a struggler now at the end of my days.	37.49764723717297
But I will fight for the right till the end.	504.02714855534344
For Ulster will fight And Ulster will be right.	32.55449735004934
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.	186.4172811852968
— Well, sir, he began.	890.6985013011792
— I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work.	119.71880711121068
You were not born to be a teacher, I think.	83.51372220333754
Perhaps I am wrong.	111.49373913014982
— A learner rather, Stephen said.	78.56160152306202
And here what will you learn more?	93.25920419891376
Mr Deasy shook his head.	57.328317134815784
— Who knows?	963.8044367738253
he said.	401.7011151401686
To learn one must be humble.	111.98205375865692
But life is the great teacher.	206.9331774463954
Stephen rustled the sheets again.	174.68398122912959
— As regards these, he began.	72.51442028245086
— Yes, Mr Deasy said.	512.844623587828
You have two copies there.	88.31897240106444
If you can have them published at once.	24.175039127159092
_ Telegraph.	330.1177574300355
Irish <URL> — I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow.	248.11021096470563
I know two editors slightly.	113.89179478327563
— That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly.	257.534200904651
I wrote last night to Mr Field, <URL>. There is a meeting of the cattletraders ’ association today at the City Arms hotel.	83.21972199010102
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting.	43.11221131167162
You see if you can get it into your two papers.	26.494773797972353
What are they?	4455.532630732874
_ — The Evening Telegraph... _ — That will do, Mr Deasy said.	40.543017462322304
There is no time to lose.	50.80969508280743
Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin.	73.03949105603643
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.	116.46619958840495
Thank you.	83.27464327019725
— Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.	156.3091482481491
I like to break a lance with you, old as I am.	114.3804369747943
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.	207.27226708281458
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.	35.79269387220565
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors.	118.8186933139056
Still I will help him in his fight.	262.7017770989103
Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.	29.57823709741364
— Mr Dedalus! Running after me.	119.97823450742884
No more letters, I hope.	642.7318358288893
— Just one moment.	226.36432734300777
— Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.	181.83954380785036
Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.	19.57474914737842
— I just wanted to say, he said.	1096.5775672683524
Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews.	17.613247144138313
Do you know that?	143.78969523575
No. And do you know why?	89.98427859584855
He frowned sternly on the bright air.	273.78178133293625
— Why, sir?	1004.8434200103395
Stephen asked, beginning to smile.	131.70080415536705
— Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.	259.63844932421034
He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air.	63.00069564541874
— She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path.	65.83457270961718
That ’ s why.	158.45388920657822
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.	24.690015841891448
Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes.	40.71365946393095
Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot.	83.49980293179833
Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs.	18.92324544513634
Limits of the diaphane.	722.4455553271567
But he adds: in bodies.	69.915035026721
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured.	133.7025726853957
How?	528.9017885059641
By knocking his sconce against them, sure.	34.51349853233746
Go easy.	160.6886987473072
Bald he was and a millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_.	33.13272763808974
Limit of the diaphane in.	332.82161208745714
Why in?	1842.7905624496589
Diaphane, adiaphane.	112.77067707425105
If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door.	24.615540815111263
Shut your eyes and see.	11.96626117389458
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells.	125.14349003265352
You are walking through it howsomever.	74.68136749687159
A very short space of time through very short times of space.	64.17938226607693
Five, six: the _nacheinander_.	45.89251205589501
Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible.	157.62267896451965
Open your eyes.	81.0954663894799
No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles o ’ er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_ ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark.	49.13972527591694
My ash sword hangs at my side.	24.588974863973576
Tap with it: they do.	249.83696147183582
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, _nebeneinander_.	340.71930075218916
Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los Demiurgos_.	49.98141696885899
Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?	18.686150070018087
Crush, crack, crick, crick.	26.916871003851607
Wild sea money.	82.54364171518819
Dominie Deasy kens them a ’.	46.19439732572097
Won ’ t you come to Sandymount, Madeline the mare?	44.74521691255922
Rhythm begins, you see.	55.87623464196126
I hear.	522.8110493581278
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching.	62.89294973441692
No, agallop: _deline the mare_.	109.09052566398022
Open your eyes now.	43.933808966708064
I will.	346.0507017077635
One moment.	127.31511872973628
Has all vanished since?	46.085374030773536
If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane.	228.94708897386204
_Basta! _ I will see if I can see.	1602.0477453769497
See now.	1607.3390507321358
There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.	64.00469621801294
They came down the steps from Leahy ’ s terrace prudently, _Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand.	67.00829095261835
Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother.	210.70044828459427
Number one swung lourdily her midwife ’ s bag, the other ’ s gamp poked in the beach.	133.73022415036237
From the liberties, out for the day.	80.87653948618886
Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street.	27.14769264497806
One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.	62.321193632623235
Creation from nothing.	88.40530891686868
What has she in the bag?	545.8757229174892
A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.	30.47753108740088
The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh.	190.62564776550218
That is why mystic monks.	31.809078147901424
Will you be as gods?	51.746124685740185
Gaze in your _omphalos_.	544.4647482945139
Hello.	198.81596679899442
Kinch here.	236.42471054657503
Put me on to Edenville.	1024.1385627579905
Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.	76.09821090044511
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve.	14.810989078521681
She had no navel.	130.6407187142978
Gaze.	525.8816296405445
Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting.	20.987658891510996
Womb of sin.	94.390861773835
Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten.	42.17527658345459
By them, the man with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.	169.53803799743653
From before the ages He willed me and now may not will me away or ever.	17.879246625335753
A _lex eterna_ stays about Him.	57.673089195528455
Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial?	42.3652869057764
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions?	144.73720652069514
Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality.	39.629056962093955
Illstarred heresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.	18.75867220279406
With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.	29.236328645791517
Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs.	60.18021892003285

Get down, baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar ’ s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.	21.6008295044322
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it.	243.98633220800338
Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.	22.984575751383623

More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth tram alone crying to the rain: _Naked women! Naked women! _ What about that, eh?	87.66868928603736
What about what?	262.2468469652367
What else were they invented for?	116.11220423714451

He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.	72.51884339667446
The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of seeds of brightness.	29.039536531705075
Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I?	49.14303391810233
He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil.	109.89111024619544
Turn back.	101.74060709264819
Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new sockets.	32.598446944138786
The cold domed room of the tower waits.	153.5358787746359
Through the barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor.	9.879596718257432
Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night.	7.2799781130902845
In the darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned platters.	25.828031760623006
Who to clear it?	274.0910825076634
He has the key.	176.56952290783707
I will not sleep there when this night comes.	61.146586705038054
A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer.	72.69964502133116
Call: no answer.	58.83200392644124
He lifted his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders.	48.07441858749212
Take all, keep all.	66.24643524631693
My soul walks with me, form of forms.	55.17165818544592
So in the moon ’ s midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore ’ s tempting flood.	93.34450821759354
The flood is following me.	124.43126358010366
I can watch it flow past from here.	99.26558433260807
Get back then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there.	148.8342341043352
He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a grike.	26.770898728784676
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack.	49.46558331885773
_Un coche ensablé_ Louis Veuillot called Gautier ’ s prose.	49.54390264400304
These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here.	9.304520483704625
And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats.	62.4117192372477
Hide gold there.	88.57022238867917
Try it.	80.14950891064109
You have some.	459.98344265596
Sands and stones.	129.53949124709393
Heavy of the past.	324.6414117646911
Sir Lout ’ s toys.	281.0709973211836
Mind you don ’ t get one bang on the ear.	103.4417948287168
I ’ m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones.	16.654658408959342
Feefawfum.	1218.4197832253003
I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman.	47.0172869483961
A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.	22.88326458205639
Lord, is he going to attack me?	207.0457494199047
Respect his liberty.	88.40530891686868
You will not be master of others or their slave.	46.01549464401969
I have my stick.	212.08523475480095
Sit tight.	97.7259284314435
From farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two.	26.00972550802473
The two maries.	366.9207391588016
They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.	12.100165039030026
Peekaboo.	1218.4197832253003
I see you.	324.94417561677994
No, the dog.	9299.329849574382
He is running back to them.	138.5718826745389
Who?	6852.683178373304
Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf.	26.49986540947278
Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold.	11.283720873145857
A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows.	30.307150846233846
Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers ’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat.	16.223933491896066
Famine, plague and slaughters.	40.66534266626026
Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.	91.50776788901308
I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires.	50.45471627137843
I spoke to no - one: none to me.	130.26665022817846
The dog ’ s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back.	221.68377389298294
Dog of my enemy.	118.44822707187852
I just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about.	32.04395516803503
_Terribilia meditans_.	275.29382542023205
A primrose doublet, fortune ’ s knave, smiled on my fear.	70.28627934746774
For that are you pining, the bark of their applause?	105.46286791752938
Pretenders: live their lives.	40.66534266626026
The Bruce ’ s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York ’ s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned.	40.08018744292624
All kings ’ sons.	60.556626178991515
Paradise of pretenders then and now.	37.50075561785772
He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur ’ s yelping.	77.48163621314117
But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house.	35.885542619731005
House of...	22.622278092364855
We don ’ t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities.	156.42508783812636
Would you do what he did?	340.04511518716237
A boat would be near, a lifebuoy.	143.2604113301837
_Natürlich_, put there for you.	254.62450866738922
Would you or would you not?	44.096514424105145
The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden ’ s rock.	85.95578312392264
They are waiting for him now.	152.60750052090927
The truth, spit it out.	178.33696409195008
I would want to.	322.22577988886815
I would try.	439.42417681966367
I am not a strong swimmer.	102.74071232951619
Water cold soft.	82.54364171518819
When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes.	171.77985794082002
Can ’ t see! Who ’ s behind me?	126.51705136936897
Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured?	21.567809916450713
If I had land under my feet.	33.45793485183509
I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine.	75.45068006230883
A drowning man.	328.5937985742326
His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death.	144.28917253910694
I...	233.544968062553
With him together down...	156.6406411379481
I could not save her.	180.233406781637
Waters: bitter death: lost.	32.24218854309747
A woman and a man.	54.51376798142034
I see her skirties.	220.06563296293643
Pinned up, I bet.	527.6088667688542
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all sides.	17.073937631277555
Looking for something lost in a past life.	29.66403102524773
Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull.	45.91544483156982
The man ’ s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears.	81.86419645681946
He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks.	32.26629789121192
On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired.	23.62251441663298
At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears.	45.846022419393684
His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse.	63.06510625210162
They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.	18.013580645432473
Cocklepickers.	1218.4197832253003
They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out.	84.8737114188686
The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning.	31.22421578532502
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf ’ s tongue redpanting from his jaws.	38.929738620630836
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf ’ s gallop.	114.47647499630142
The carcass lay on his path.	420.17334855181986
He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog ’ s bedraggled fell.	73.51778010344424
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal.	32.914288271991765
Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody ’ s body.	75.81471989256673
— Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel! The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight.	23.656469346483124
He slunk back in a curve.	158.63637379405347
Doesn ’ t see me.	31.94663097464798
Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it.	49.019065397788474
He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock.	23.783937102961048
The simple pleasures of the poor.	590.0530732907644
His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.	44.337400890087295
He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.	42.29618236634419
Wait.	199.9002065950114
Street of harlots.	68.11626444130661
Remember.	298.79553197946194
Haroun al Raschid.	101.55103292581168
I am almosting it.	213.4969663236459
That man led me, spoke.	163.13893065462742
I was not afraid.	733.0789961924793
The melon he had he held against my face.	232.89219196870727
Smiled: creamfruit smell.	62.200804154614865
That was the rule, said.	137.33305109009905
Red carpet spread.	69.43678443005035
You will see who.	131.76608176919405
Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.	77.1737312755128
His blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck.	22.64822313385668
With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his strolling mort.	36.86252547423261
Spoils slung at her back.	213.3175663737274
About her windraw face hair trailed.	19.836072333287046
Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville.	17.07073865745762
When night hides her body ’ s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired.	27.97798948956485
Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O ’ Loughlin ’ s of Blackpitts.	42.88444171399668
Buss her, wap in rogues ’ rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend ’ s whiteness under her rancid rags.	32.99490998591311
Fumbally ’ s lane that night: the tanyard smells.	113.26133981904275
White thy fambles, red thy gan And thy quarrons dainty is.	9.230268385545902
Couch a hogshead with me then.	48.08886654389919
In the darkmans clip and kiss.	82.4342080493229
Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.	22.412735516137086
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted.	46.0297464747764
Call away let him: _thy quarrons dainty is_.	28.809352862987396
Language no whit worse than his.	42.433106462285174
Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.	13.517898384714375
Passing now.	178.5825216515837
A side eye at my Hamlet hat.	157.01608356645144
If I were suddenly naked here as I sit?	46.88875449335239
I am not.	228.20857494375772
She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load.	18.866420183865454
A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake.	70.02427090440602
Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea.	19.44358153010807
Behold the handmaid of the moon.	94.2446150181716
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise.	36.71243638144363
Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled.	26.65008441461348
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	30.953332073288284
Here.	216.12647889293197
Put a pin in that chap, will you?	24.974533872552463
My tablets.	183.0162153306878
Mouth to her kiss.	75.96108206095379
No. Must be two of em.	100.25327357942274
Glue em well.	112.77067707425105
Mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	183.4353987996249
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.	55.92459802057572
Oomb, allwombing tomb.	62.200804154614865
His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayaway.	10.455869538641217
Paper.	1218.4197832253003
The banknotes, blast them.	137.00255264165477
Old Deasy ’ s letter.	46.940088211417596
Here.	216.12647889293197
Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words.	35.45267406290205
That ’ s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.	59.75616097690956
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending.	78.38133764035068
Why not endless till the farthest star?	238.0725346361576
Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds.	35.400345044606
Me sits there with his augur ’ s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.	20.037265558914168
I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back.	84.60274853371727
Endless, would it be mine, form of my form?	48.200604097733674
Who watches me here?	326.82200483819804
Who ever anywhere will read these written words?	44.175620208378895
Signs on a white field.	141.49928688504733
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.	120.90693569040808
The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field.	37.505689981385814
Hold hard.	79.39786985585587
Coloured on a flat: yes, that ’ s right.	262.92811956184363
Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back.	42.723036880511984
Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope.	45.38083390690441
Click does the trick.	65.41894000189005
You find my words dark.	164.15599455975712
Darkness is in our souls do you not think?	138.76546688694316
Flutier.	1218.4197832253003
Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.	37.62639061560698
She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes.	420.36855552890427
Now where the blue hell am I bringing her beyond the veil?	55.256958641181036
Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality.	106.20870291262949
She, she, she.	6025.820562382418
What she?	1387.6667015560424
The virgin at Hodges Figgis ’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write.	33.35546526665816
Keen glance you gave her.	67.17560141768023
Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade.	154.37576037008873
She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters.	87.04868366406359
Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup.	13.537608989968952
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.	11.846775195039164
Talk about apple dumplings, _piuttosto_.	7.156217291728359
Where are your wits?	184.4971377467105
Touch me.	106.835529875271
Soft eyes.	116.55730775236917
Soft soft soft hand.	39.49918276163476
I am lonely here.	213.42716392438788
O, touch me soon, now.	92.35425520537737
What is that word known to all men?	240.53942711196297
I am quiet here alone.	116.97302374105648
Sad too.	120.35500764134997
Touch, touch me.	48.68112080035971
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes.	54.632432205147076
That is Kevin Egan ’ s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep.	60.94553030651456
_Et vidit Deus.	112.77067707425105
Et erant valde bona_.	50.78059647831953
Alo! _Bonjour_.	112.77067707425105
Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun.	26.054640757764616
I am caught in this burning scene.	88.57738272097038
Pan ’ s hour, the faunal noon.	403.53726307470095
Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.	27.16369330763268
Pain is far.	102.82716835314805
And no more turn aside and brood.	131.57267631229863
His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck ’ s castoffs, _nebeneinander_.	102.2595724661131
He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another ’ s foot had nested warm.	34.191950777821674
The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove.	50.61034069229544
But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt ’ s shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.	52.570756578029254
_Tiens, quel petit pied! _ Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde ’ s love that dare not speak its name.	27.55193015295372
His arm: Cranly ’ s arm.	55.539475384867586
He now will leave me.	117.91002503238524
And the blame?	283.37853357831494
As I am.	107.71615748741364
As I am.	107.71615748741364
All or not at all.	77.19325218305408
In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing.	31.281049133950294
No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks, swirling, passing.	52.084691289182594
Better get this job over quick.	20.409558878108175
Listen: a fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos.	11.429275269646448
Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks.	19.346295898694144
In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels.	13.169988421514839
And, spent, its speech ceases.	41.07496204931231
It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.	12.151830038707146
Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds.	8.312739149656736
Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall.	17.58314011990329
Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit_.	23.461609136395086
To no end gathered; vainly then released, forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon.	20.55290787823379
Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.	29.412663618843233
Five fathoms out there.	68.97979976508583
Full fathom five thy father lies.	30.37458811774903
At one, he said.	1282.090787459614
Found drowned.	203.07158957055697
High water at Dublin bar.	30.266626099393328
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells.	16.94513337448676
A corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward.	18.796939088586896
There he is.	49.11586771895052
Hook it quick.	88.40530891686868
Pull.	684.2060590120853
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.	25.890755818582715
We have him.	461.7808617468864
Easy now.	275.29382542023205
Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine.	20.155653524631006
A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.	60.534774778780275
God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.	13.000463235932122
Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead.	8.629240672253179
Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.	50.4026961535292
A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue.	73.10143295029808
Seadeath, mildest of all deaths known to man.	75.77546885314156
Old Father Ocean.	74.50094559707586
_Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.	26.916871003851607
Just you give it a fair trial.	39.87569856267098
We enjoyed ourselves immensely.	193.54231338412464
Come.	232.90336313975413
I thirst.	1365.6383391264305
Clouding over.	275.29382542023205
No black clouds anywhere, are there?	229.89163532567838
Thunderstorm.	1218.4197832253003
Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, _Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_.	19.02079383745722
No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal shoon.	23.246061839516774
Where?	2503.021043628515
To evening lands.	451.060547844804
Evening will find itself.	58.72652702505468
He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.	171.42478642581548
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me.	129.7033499441705
All days make their end.	39.74222289727652
By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.	31.68008856665934
Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum.	63.58278053878862
Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet.	55.38043253874288
_Già_.	644.5508818121558
For the old hag with the yellow teeth.	35.073994395439065
_Già_.	644.5508818121558
My teeth are very bad.	35.555803094836676
Why, I wonder.	261.5828492109566
Feel.	302.9147764884481
That one is going too.	342.65258456341616
Shells.	1218.4197832253003
Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money?	107.83356572759017
That one.	179.8291503566203
This.	574.9188693373202
Toothless Kinch, the superman.	400.44864263529445
Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?	60.776621530709555
My handkerchief.	183.0162153306878
He threw it.	305.52133669686435
I remember.	345.22188283682004
Did I not take it up?	178.35442880106538
His hand groped vainly in his pockets.	153.93439369504537
No, I didn ’ t.	2562.3271461181807
Better buy one.	92.63670375763105
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully.	27.161334836657492
For the rest let look who will.	30.451704068011345
Behind.	27.722408315359914
Perhaps there is someone.	110.08040777563777
He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant.	54.38948754953486
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.	30.15783612141438
Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.	24.235509428941796
He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods ’ roes.	14.234596805006165
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.	20.942041031563058
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray.	123.68828097585103
Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.	34.09162613451836
Made him feel a bit peckish.	58.33047176204782
Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right.	19.426967358209243
She didn ’ t like her plate full.	110.49118919857929
Right.	198.54428873542537
He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire.	44.6043270442719
It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out.	35.859402176142815
Cup of tea soon.	78.48613697342506
Good.	264.03688012757516
Mouth dry.	16.127683096625855
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.	40.447217179490195
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing.	25.169891416319064
Just how she stalks over my writingtable.	23.98347121566003
Prr.	644.5508818121558
Scratch my head.	142.29831189077726
Prr.	644.5508818121558
Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form.	23.280547913382396
Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes.	83.59085805369563
He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.	439.7573037834416
— Milk for the pussens, he said.	1103.8438059330458
— Mrkgnao! the cat cried.	326.33878363695345
They call them stupid.	220.33230267300223
They understand what we say better than we understand them.	43.46006296193854
She understands all she wants to.	86.70624250708666
Vindictive too.	275.29382542023205
Cruel.	525.8816296405445
Her nature.	174.10786477101323
Curious mice never squeal.	33.93115690475533
Seem to like it.	78.94655943220823
Wonder what I look like to her.	496.16345750758427
Height of a tower?	166.26024043692132
No, she can jump me.	797.2104818600496
— Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly.	600.5954038282158
Afraid of the chookchooks.	799.3163962764563
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.	48.66085109024185
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth.	29.10337835198901
He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.	30.128629983915392
Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon ’ s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.	48.4045353969051
— Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.	409.1147562596679
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly.	34.4336324670938
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can ’ t mouse after.	70.04993818503037
Why?	2421.489910325178
They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips.	280.30125627311384
Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.	176.99946897527803
He listened to her licking lap.	450.86306745754325
Ham and eggs, no.	135.63118024162313
No good eggs with this drouth.	77.69012170986849
Want pure fresh water.	89.68715019690559
Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley ’ s.	117.9545352165465
Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.	45.37575045797123
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz ’ s.	51.45593871912865
While the kettle is boiling.	34.9674675244323
Why are their tongues so rough?	90.9689154727298
To lap better, all porous holes.	118.28932798605133
Nothing she can eat?	58.64712068453912
He glanced round him.	170.20118540602155
She might like something tasty.	114.83645417537907
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning.	53.63606849701452
Still perhaps: once in a way.	34.51682375531475
He said softly in the bare hall: — I ’ m going round the corner.	268.1920169618922
Be back in a minute.	55.32855287483094
And when he had heard his voice say it he added: — You don ’ t want anything for breakfast?	57.22872047975538
A sleepy soft grunt answered: — Mn. No. She didn ’ t want anything.	60.64032762954508
Must get those settled really.	30.50719229145879
Pity.	234.3609564447618
All the way from Gibraltar.	80.43177957052991
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew.	31.30648989495489
Wonder what her father gave for it.	29.26885254188834
Old style.	163.9658735208453
Ah yes! of course.	174.42397030348087
Bought it at the governor ’ s auction.	298.76440053928985
Got a short knock.	44.70307152882779
Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy.	30.221796323186744
Yes, sir.	733.512678382765
At Plevna that was.	812.9258410304335
I rose from the ranks, sir, and I ’ m proud of it.	213.70356808878992
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps.	58.42231187353582
Now that was farseeing.	344.43910781707734
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof.	36.97177592945667
Stamps: stickyback pictures.	62.200804154614865
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too.	65.55898263484796
Course they do.	55.15210118134959
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto ’ s high grade ha.	190.17853528335579
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband.	51.23868186806697
White slip of paper.	34.89397276614467
Quite safe.	163.65561842024064
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey.	154.29924145527713
In the trousers I left off.	114.15082312288978
Must get it.	148.18236479055324
Potato I have.	111.93869476731099
Creaky wardrobe.	275.29382542023205
No use disturbing her.	26.066629475772228
She turned over sleepily that time.	119.60939219148679
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.	29.648273539882265
Looked shut.	186.38277244620522
All right till I come back anyhow.	66.16274677078609
He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive.	27.847053951726675
The sun was nearing the steeple of George ’ s church.	56.77907585895443
Be a warm day I fancy.	33.71634336604378
Specially in these black clothes feel it more.	28.100505443595843
Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat.	33.632568194954885
But I couldn ’ t go in that light suit.	44.752706846372575
Make a picnic of it.	84.94892507355766
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth.	28.17120938802144
Boland ’ s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday ’ s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.	39.36380498872346
Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn.	42.417934659932186
Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day ’ s march on him.	65.39651139386451
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.	138.19651001275915
Walk along a strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy ’ s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.	36.755244727519916
Wander through awned streets.	62.200804154614865
Turbaned faces going by.	75.4002985238613
Dark caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe.	7.579742120617886
Cries of sellers in the streets.	205.28292455492956
Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet.	16.97943103525031
Dander along all day.	71.31241790042927
Might meet a robber or two.	38.414790709851665
Well, meet him.	232.89575376805465
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up.	63.32546358112208
A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind.	275.3881812295692
I pass on.	396.7162728269075
Fading gold sky.	112.77070430784757
A mother watches me from her doorway.	101.79850942033568
She calls her children home in their dark language.	67.42757332737311
High wall: beyond strings twanged.	19.200405174103004
Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly ’ s new garters.	28.96865780225113
Strings.	1218.4197832253003
Listen.	229.3127775797817
I pass.	1114.8365871605633
Probably not a bit like it really.	161.6425239759265
Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun.	99.58754148418804
Sunburst on the titlepage.	676.8330752555285
He smiled, pleasing himself.	21.275360075457453
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland.	43.95338593708273
He prolonged his pleased smile.	107.29752580878716
Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	40.5056562925031
He approached Larry O ’ Rourke ’ s.	234.48439735171345
From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter.	33.886149789344714
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.	12.507245524823116
Good house, however: just the end of the city traffic.	34.88847646050592
For instance M ’ Auley ’ s down there: n.	228.0373185372578
g.	644.5508818121558
as position.	205.28271035616987
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.	34.449087427097794
Baldhead over the blind.	229.5408068121177
Cute old codger.	88.40530891686868
No use canvassing him for an ad.	162.3702773747368
Still he knows his own business best.	34.40757061039243
There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket.	26.538283918187698
Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up.	120.91780016481422
Do you know what I ’ m going to tell you?	82.29055909835392
What ’ s that, Mr O ’ Rourke?	419.83384522879635
Do you know what?	1421.1191886602653
The Russians, they ’ d only be an eight o ’ clock breakfast for the Japanese.	66.49822474692839
Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps.	83.41616777528039
Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O ’ Rourke.	57.96778092112759
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway: — Good day, Mr O ’ Rourke.	100.26423554720022
— Good day to you.	1188.8323923033035
— Lovely weather, sir.	471.7752166832413
— ’ Tis all that.	361.4211031229326
Where do they get the money?	182.22800360455483
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar.	31.881575174466175
Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.	18.315849318191116
Then think of the competition.	1054.7625933411996
General thirst.	104.48244077495224
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub.	22.25374687527746
Save it they can ’ t.	76.2207803596914
Off the drunks perhaps.	38.10776465223843
Put down three and carry five.	25.280060669567234
What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs.	84.14689417908461
Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers.	31.71818140720079
Square it you with the boss and we ’ ll split the job, see?	43.039550595487356
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month?	57.56222912345595
Say ten barrels of stuff.	44.37669906085901
Say he got ten per cent off.	35.04432092001193
O more.	1335.158178279365
Fifteen.	215.1483861869542
He passed Saint Joseph ’ s National school.	147.4187344423197
Brats ’ clamour.	112.77067707425105

Slieve Bloom.	302.1292226705364
He halted before Dlugacz ’ s window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies, black and white.	56.937410772445546
Fifteen multiplied by.	73.54907219170263
The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade.	85.50027383701804
The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs ’ blood.	17.190528469288886
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last.	103.14763942305389
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter.	273.8510617146084
Would she buy it too, calling the items from a slip in her hand?	35.04116491468239
Chapped: washingsoda.	112.77067707425105
And a pound and a half of Denny ’ s sausages.	84.82309549921918

Whacking a carpet on the clothesline.	177.13726886882094
She does whack it, by George.	401.7654476734489
The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.	93.00273851443968
Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.	83.92202617902862
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias.	23.80281189542194
Can become ideal winter sanatorium.	43.19390070727712
Moses Montefiore.	203.07158957055697
I thought he was.	409.3619906232822
Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping.	67.50376258634411
He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling.	78.11671119205867
A young white heifer.	116.8885931738289
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there ’ s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands.	35.26371056246886
He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest.	34.65350703547899
The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.	29.91649839954884
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace.	21.167690384471168
— Now, my miss, he said.	335.15405336544035
She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.	62.011084766094335
— Thank you, my miss.	316.40154158787817
And one shilling threepence change.	17.745303434542873
Mr Bloom pointed quickly.	208.1288170975804
To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams.	40.58451413988745
Pleasant to see first thing in the morning.	189.24894736084647
Hurry up, damn it.	71.44390590062882
Make hay while the sun shines.	253.5340397372198
He sighed down his nose: they never understand.	191.21705380153122
Sodachapped hands.	1956.2268556692889
Crusted toenails too.	112.77067707425105
Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.	15.340363213427276
The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast.	23.357483732130298
For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles ’ Lane.	24.656106543360163
They like them sizeable.	146.65608877637328
Prime sausage.	275.29382542023205
O please, Mr Policeman, I ’ m lost in the wood.	390.6970270017501
— Threepence, please.	368.31422103126084
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.	16.9462017363147
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers ’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles.	42.91126176153078
They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.	35.57598251124517
— Thank you, sir.	829.1189901051516
Another time.	138.9089725036263
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him.	28.979394955064492
He withdrew his gaze after an instant.	63.61474308108667
No: better not: another time.	51.82799095219991
— Good morning, he said, moving away.	1608.2396134282915
— Good morning, sir.	328.82853315086396
No sign.	1344.0689515154133
Gone.	195.9801606796253
What matter?	1386.2450688890237
He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely.	145.01198126041695
Agendath Netaim: planters ’ company.	30.354151604764294
To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees.	17.351764790737953

Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.	23.512155148116776
You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons.	19.749462812868337
Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation.	20.155653524631006

Nothing doing.	110.54846457105975
He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat.	82.0981920077574
Silverpowdered olivetrees.	275.29382542023205
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening.	23.512155148116776
Olives are packed in jars, eh?	23.519551042846306
I have a few left from Andrews.	176.461101094862
Molly spitting them out.	196.71081720809437
Knows the taste of them now.	50.09214908837971
Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.	26.916871003851607
Citrons too.	275.29382542023205
Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin ’ s parade.	38.31815615350929
And Mastiansky with the old cither.	197.87167305589827
Pleasant evenings we had then.	66.1726358188157
Molly in Citron ’ s basketchair.	167.91418729455793
Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.	35.710274483371144
Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume.	27.16600408885699
Always the same, year after year.	58.52276229008579
They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me.	42.8765232613729
Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times.	24.01733718322745
Must be without a flaw, he said.	116.87194175995859
Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant.	59.14048073179481
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees.	29.018207152237107
There ’ s whatdoyoucallhim out of.	224.37110272783903
How do you?	445.4517207982498
Doesn ’ t see.	44.59579058812776
Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore.	51.05382338280645
His back is like that Norwegian captain ’ s.	266.6405200333148
Watering cart.	275.29382542023205
To provoke the rain.	214.22666042489942
On earth as it is in heaven.	613.8644826163986
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly.	38.336869570122836
Grey.	724.3403374961829
Far.	195.1454474657171
No, not like that.	4550.4546521227885
A barren land, bare waste.	92.2957137316472
Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth.	54.62065721280948
No wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters.	22.031695670810095
Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom.	28.816839429273646
All dead names.	109.20310675597618
A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old.	67.00208786550326
Old now.	163.9658735208453
It bore the oldest, the first race.	245.7959668273822
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy ’ s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.	57.94081067823547
The oldest people.	431.5904733650626
Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere.	27.576166040817903
It lay there now.	55.503958309576255
Now it could bear no more.	228.53118110888278
Dead: an old woman ’ s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.	96.7525661463432
Desolation.	1218.4197832253003
Grey horror seared his flesh.	33.189068920690104
Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward.	32.410620577331805
Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.	10.357441562826754
Well, I am here now.	217.34194775063435
Yes, I am here now.	233.25487556117815
Morning mouth bad images.	47.95886141701586
Got up wrong side of the bed.	132.71945254469438
Must begin again those Sandow ’ s exercises.	89.44519203098055
On the hands down.	169.12925668327998
Blotchy brown brick houses.	62.200804154614865
Number eighty still unlet.	53.11162088141111
Why is that?	323.5433438967445
Valuation is only twentyeight.	87.51021292869767
Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills.	11.448082927632104
Plasters on a sore eye.	104.84373526334343
To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter.	51.79742082783168
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh.	25.582862295684627
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath.	14.138333962243326
Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.	224.90553339576664
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor.	106.0523534460725
He stooped and gathered them.	94.83845253017098
Mrs Marion Bloom.	70.58180918720721
His quickened heart slowed at once.	65.26978741374597
Bold hand.	149.05501788242162
Mrs Marion.	69.59074062117067
— Poldy! Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.	27.46012406525586
— Who are the letters for?	339.6898419788229
He looked at them.	129.19586182558928
Mullingar.	502.22953946992163
Milly.	292.57084530121165
— A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.	339.19962578199505
And a letter for you.	127.33905467842932
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.	52.655561885182664
— Do you want the blind up?	262.10092255337577
— That do?	906.403721501661
he asked, turning.	66.62098108393307
She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.	52.12748129888738
— She got the things, she said.	201.78728295273973
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.	35.63628534225921
— Hurry up with that tea, she said.	470.40112005546143
I ’ m parched.	224.40083206289455
— The kettle is boiling, he said.	213.58481672380148
But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.	34.86939470471456
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called: — Poldy! — What?	95.41499799293811
— Scald the teapot.	478.90600350178346
On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout.	40.33560009078315
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in.	38.88018765812351
Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt.	21.54821724025654
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him.	15.446312766462908
Give her too much meat she won ’ t mouse.	66.02001312656115
Say they won ’ t eat pork.	72.62425059026737
Kosher.	644.5508818121558
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce.	20.740989895805257
Pepper.	812.0832237234374
Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.	71.57922445945786
Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan ’ s seaside girls.	16.364588075696552
The tea was drawn.	213.64728763919373
He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby, smiling.	38.17255208982099
Silly Milly ’ s birthday gift.	123.96524372324734
No, wait: four.	415.15840230124394
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke.	109.1682523830627
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her.	109.85804940232576
He smiled, pouring.	28.566303571572195
You are my lookingglass from night to morning.	32.81711127597211
I ’ d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.	25.676663850352966
Poor old professor Goodwin.	53.27639008033786
Dreadful old case.	82.54364171518819
Still he was a courteous old chap.	107.20616751684274
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform.	72.12765346557346
And the little mirror in his silk hat.	431.2844001433181
O, look what I found in professor Goodwin ’ s hat! All we laughed.	160.80894606428276
Sex breaking out even then.	44.898178407770196
Pert little piece she was.	48.822086114917255
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray.	106.06539002589737
Its hump bumped as he took it up.	89.41801297372902
Everything on it?	957.3395068809858
Yes.	1763.135277433406
He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.	184.77222118652676
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.	113.72927613039768
— What a time you were! she said.	116.05928718060896
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat ’ s udder.	59.6090695605798
The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.	86.65854846072145
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow.	29.73536619097408
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.	26.375701579717948
— Who was the letter from?	529.1909746741517
he asked.	72.62503664047722
Bold hand.	149.05501788242162
Marion.	529.9448539670102
— O, Boylan, she said.	323.7278543238818
He ’ s bringing the programme.	292.76687169042685
— What are you singing?	290.7526328275327
— _Là ci darem_ with J.	114.21141989591881
Doyle, she said, and _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_.	341.1687424589472
Her full lips, drinking, smiled.	35.421749437665234
Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day.	13.458475814003693
Like foul flowerwater.	117.700699598149
— Would you like the window open a little?	1023.7739382722161
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking: — What time is the funeral?	52.41012905528206
— Eleven, I think, he answered.	1452.5241373664326
I didn ’ t see the paper.	146.31235069303636
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed.	44.16872146121846
No?	4159.767177045142
Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.	20.265059271806297
— No: that book.	423.66356391879424
Other stocking.	165.13029581587372
Her petticoat.	174.10786477101323
— It must have fell down, she said.	203.9173849763528
He felt here and there.	157.6661399877748
_Voglio e non vorrei_.	50.78059647831953
Wonder if she pronounces that right: _voglio_.	26.09681837798609
Not in the bed.	407.91022565130794
Must have slid down.	36.46916281222204
He stooped and lifted the valance.	87.72043599926764
The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.	78.42362458564
— Show here, she said.	450.904569769647
I put a mark in it.	134.62799991853268
There ’ s a word I wanted to ask you.	117.95267523078508
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.	20.5445583784931
— Met him what?	843.2819420037855
he asked.	72.62503664047722
What does that mean?	21.727273848576584
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.	43.65386919860743
— Metempsychosis?	2901.269617769212
— Yes.	1061.8201792287966
— Metempsychosis, he said, frowning.	2592.007365280401
It ’ s Greek: from the Greek.	100.0162588608231
That means the transmigration of souls.	31.731900714775765
— O, rocks! she said.	113.63686317057883
Tell us in plain words.	192.9916761717745
The same young eyes.	252.9037034889127
The first night after the charades.	32.11840193671358
Dolphin ’ s Barn.	39.34678549686493
He turned over the smudged pages.	138.76899959913504
_Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_.	256.5423166757109
Hello.	198.81596679899442
Fierce Italian with carriagewhip.	62.200804154614865
Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor naked.	156.84122876982394
Sheet kindly lent.	88.40530891686868
_The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath_.	41.57557633276133
Cruelty behind it all.	85.8422273508649
Doped animals.	275.29382542023205
Trapeze at Hengler ’ s.	165.4120140740218
Had to look the other way.	67.419908096947
Mob gaping.	275.29382542023205
Break your neck and we ’ ll break our sides.	57.78337130659062
Families of them.	143.52927373070327
Bone them young so they metamspychosis.	43.8734615389435
That we live after death.	36.74884186044289
Our souls.	126.77637322686988
That a man ’ s soul after he dies.	93.28073948371919
Dignam ’ s soul...	184.57318861728444
— Did you finish it?	236.73172487695362
he asked.	72.62503664047722
— Yes, she said.	512.4542014027112
There ’ s nothing smutty in it.	66.43610466582398
Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?	130.0296638763992
— Never read it.	394.23004281243755
Do you want another?	238.59982445641305
— Yes.	1061.8201792287966
Get another of Paul de Kock ’ s.	53.236973725335
Nice name he has.	360.2466800530625
She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.	35.27201395288627
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they ’ ll write to Kearney, my guarantor.	23.372162160464867
Reincarnation: that ’ s the word.	120.34132226650924
— Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before.	177.61640280450305
They call it reincarnation.	265.1619031932853
That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.	40.33454938488237
They say we have forgotten it.	320.22466513382386
Some say they remember their past lives.	24.43400803362266
The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea.	36.15893623907976
Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis.	110.07581484073769
An example would be better.	252.97115016690066
The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed.	240.21381510858535
Given away with the Easter number of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours.	17.4823534260522
Tea before you put milk in.	60.650909864618576
Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer.	38.59759076397457
Three and six I gave for the frame.	469.0666886913027
She said it would look nice over the bed.	106.65996950568123
Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.	56.365964002875295
He turned the pages back.	543.66117093864
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance.	66.59225894051383
What they called nymphs, for example.	80.63099800493993
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar.	87.0429043314705
She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils.	34.97851168943881
— There ’ s a smell of burn, she said.	292.1530051058208
Did you leave anything on the fire?	155.67710895403505
— The kidney! he cried suddenly.	114.92397231350031
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork ’ s legs.	35.456275650675764
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan.	91.40198532230187
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.	46.74109328746168
Only a little burnt.	69.75999132628138
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.	57.585010140043714
Cup of tea now.	78.48613697342506
He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat.	74.48283736159561
Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat.	26.12312568023747
Done to a turn.	131.47876275534645
A mouthful of tea.	191.2917417847018
Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth.	93.32780421307471
What was that about some young student and a picnic?	62.43340837866395
He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.	40.508340568140746
Dearest Papli Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present.	162.6150951940525
It suits me splendid.	60.56898795555042
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam.	75.20599335871302
I got mummy ’ s lovely box of creams and am writing.	67.99900422043521
They are lovely.	301.00506924949076
I am getting on swimming in the photo business now.	134.9907572871201
Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs.	98.81237935333266
Will send when developed.	48.7267730262568
We did great biz yesterday.	118.7908378905319
Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in.	236.67530849005422
We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic.	84.40143727862056
Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks.	26.303108262671117
I hear them at the piano downstairs.	855.4029557587502
There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.	132.3012844608589
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan ’ s (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan ’ s) song about those seaside girls.	26.129170942686823
Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects.	39.96770808154893
I must now close with fondest love Your fond daughter Milly P.	28.837525255905362
S.	189.6702203090223
Excuse bad writing am in hurry.	19.21016877543337
M.	220.98386498097403
Fifteen yesterday.	120.8946647122669
Curious, fifteenth of the month too.	70.5513815335251
Her first birthday away from home.	121.01170397145253
Separation.	1218.4197832253003
Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street.	25.35859949830643
Jolly old woman.	125.73252876501394
Lot of babies she must have helped into the world.	42.11263938722891
She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn ’ t live.	146.95797389942706
Well, God is good, sir.	209.92658747288957
She knew at once.	27.660230483644924
He would be eleven now if he had lived.	150.3128502398881
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript.	154.59212045908944
Excuse bad writing.	49.27954655866259
Hurry.	469.9420631433986
Piano downstairs.	236.33038669289743
Coming out of her shell.	79.34417703428065
Row with her in the XL Café about the bracelet.	224.5046637063064
Wouldn ’ t eat her cakes or speak or look.	26.514421346986527
Saucebox.	1218.4197832253003
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney.	37.10892727998142
Twelve and six a week.	80.98164581451061
Not much.	162.52858587462256
Still, she might do worse.	94.93235875421017
Music hall stage.	62.049321842328595
Young student.	82.37378319234055
He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal.	26.261249076518673
Then he read the letter again: twice.	53.96570604046003
O, well: she knows how to mind herself.	62.62338810224847
But if not?	370.4936658136072
No, nothing has happened.	365.30065872877145
Wait in any case till it does.	43.1120024448851
A wild piece of goods.	139.37972640609829
Her slim legs running up the staircase.	23.322767629017257
Destiny.	644.5508818121558
Ripening now.	275.29382542023205
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window.	62.60614382998655
Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.	41.881240265675814
Anemic a little.	306.1961710934464
Was given milk too long.	194.5325943731411
Damned old tub pitching about.	31.771888039443432
Not a bit funky.	277.3749111689705
Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.	106.09741229526244
All dimpled cheeks and curls, Your head it simply swirls.	17.165583399959992
Seaside girls.	275.56554479023197
Torn envelope.	203.07158957055697
Hands stuck in his trousers ’ pockets, jarvey off for the day, singing.	94.41925290809458
Friend of the family.	847.7223809688384
Swurls, he says.	477.7289532640825
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.	27.811443560346632
Those girls, those girls, Those lovely seaside girls.	15.091175562238561
Milly too.	112.29994615140913
Young kisses: the first.	249.27632304451035
Far away now past.	208.91420885711335
Mrs Marion.	69.59074062117067
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.	20.493663370221217
A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing.	20.23674820463866
Will happen, yes.	148.13151811702122
Prevent.	1218.4197832253003
Girl ’ s sweet light lips.	132.99116973783137
Will happen too.	65.95448411014247
He felt the flowing qualm spread over him.	40.3563513251709
Useless to move now.	10.325395124076858
Lips kissed, kissing, kissed.	40.84389431737963
Full gluey woman ’ s lips.	36.99426313764077
Better where she is down there: away.	97.12386982382081
Occupy her.	294.8472913759627
Wanted a dog to pass the time.	51.22544666910891
Might take a trip down there.	36.6573248609353
August bank holiday, only two and six return.	41.06362396234187
Six weeks off, however.	60.30065986924176
Might work a press pass.	73.56780385311923
Or through M ’ Coy.	340.6891182981292
The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door.	70.66362453160338
She looked back at him, mewing.	329.74299129091
Wants to go out.	80.54324992315775
Wait before a door sometime it will open.	40.74248028413018
Let her wait.	372.3728302312137
Has the fidgets.	76.00045009549623
Electric.	812.0832237234374
Thunder in the air.	397.22574880614735
Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too.	161.55766215655467
He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels.	169.18360251089436
He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers.	51.69276391592248
The cat mewed to him.	195.10879565599998
— Miaow! he said in answer.	376.8922749087085
Wait till I ’ m ready.	60.12669151908125
Heaviness: hot day coming.	40.689146287416406
Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.	56.040370226681524
A paper.	1245.6868246586441
He liked to read at stool.	110.4238022190947
Hope no ape comes knocking just as I ’ m.	24.55959457737521
In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_.	109.26878151787237
He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it.	65.23686739615503
The cat went up in soft bounds.	90.98772118930268
Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.	76.54765475081452
Listening, he heard her voice: — Come, come, pussy.	121.81121097740018
Come.	232.90336313975413
He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden.	111.36051292966724
No sound.	833.713334245954
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.	48.56437309476188
The maid was in the garden.	1825.1654713006103
Fine morning.	104.56273464081006
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.	61.789554909854736
Make a summerhouse here.	32.52645642169434
Scarlet runners.	275.29382542023205
Want to manure the whole place over, scabby soil.	17.34242231733993
A coat of liver of sulphur.	81.738219814559
All soil like that without dung.	159.18616346286657
Household slops.	275.29382542023205
Loam, what is this that is?	661.7059839267326
The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing.	32.14402321473413
Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes.	68.76754604614067
Mulch of dung.	169.8679623667528
Best thing to clean ladies ’ kid gloves.	25.086042397105363
Dirty cleans.	203.07158957055697
Ashes too.	203.07158957055697
Reclaim the whole place.	103.39479650002069
Grow peas in that corner there.	60.31393983795004
Lettuce.	1218.4197832253003
Always have fresh greens then.	27.592431322155967
Still gardens have their drawbacks.	44.75847380201001
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.	31.464536043904996
He walked on.	165.38702106079992
Where is my hat, by the way?	720.0410898533434
Must have put it back on the peg.	109.83519387711362
Or hanging up on the floor.	666.2936398795564
Funny I don ’ t remember that.	72.47147843342226
Hallstand too full.	112.77067707425105
Four umbrellas, her raincloak.	56.533492291325594
Picking up the letters.	417.83691698709396
Drago ’ s shopbell ringing.	419.5514366287634
Queer I was just thinking that moment.	79.59420133979367
Brown brillantined hair over his collar.	75.11772473522018
Just had a wash and brushup.	81.09298068956419
Wonder have I time for a bath this morning.	89.16323175123429
Tara street.	217.30361333281138
Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say.	55.74104120558513
O ’ Brien.	621.9888843125465
Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has.	41.1771967301756
Agendath what is it?	54.13978313232306
Now, my miss.	247.90833443124563
Enthusiast.	1218.4197832253003
He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes.	153.77642613904388
Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral.	116.46456719741356
He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel.	70.20754679858327
Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces.	19.448135009048478
The king was in his countinghouse.	1050.1570906949064
Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees.	60.73493656060812
Something new and easy.	44.15007145954579
No great hurry.	400.9555695172086
Keep it a bit.	173.72170612311007
Our prize titbit: _Matcham ’ s Masterstroke_.	89.60989189536723
Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers ’ Club, London.	23.286165338256314
Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer.	63.90469196053839
Three and a half.	62.094508575591725
Three pounds three.	62.87816435369656
Three pounds, thirteen and six.	22.04564538953908
Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second.	46.640756286894415
Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone.	24.051011349246675
Hope it ’ s not too big bring on piles again.	31.63342449059338
No, just right.	1124.0287570565235
So. Ah! Costive.	143.22507010223975
One tabloid of cascara sagrada.	37.50022425197674
Life might be so.	90.33812602264135
It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat.	28.028927741616297
Print anything now.	112.77067707425105
Silly season.	120.35500764134997
He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell.	25.773939870409325
Neat certainly.	279.99223007115745
_Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now_.	43.60399499050613
Begins and ends morally.	50.78059647831953
_Hand in hand_.	112.77067707425105
Smart.	724.3403374961829
He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.	28.235713837806717
Might manage a sketch.	61.49860603365575

Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said dressing.	107.17178969185385
Dislike dressing together.	80.68211583872721
Nicked myself shaving.	112.77067707425105
Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt.	23.293328779769258

What had Gretta Conroy on?	90.49024687259703
What possessed me to buy this comb?	111.15256865527397
<URL>.	498.5117221938163
I ’ m swelled after that cabbage.	80.70038132265083
A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.	99.34758937142767
Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf.	19.129003578709867
Morning after the bazaar dance when May ’ s band played Ponchielli ’ s dance of the hours.	92.93636053140811
Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours.	68.73091233916564
Washing her teeth.	116.65150447012972
That was the first night.	402.8689654762473
Her fansticks clicking.	78.1652503040716
Is that Boylan well off?	154.7207964973523
He has money.	304.9562463904695
Why?	2421.489910325178
No use humming then.	24.901055954475176
Allude to it.	116.98094251617755
Strange kind of music that last night.	41.174705395033826
The mirror was in shadow.	905.8820327687898
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub.	26.656919840765177
Peering into it.	130.098689005963
Lines in her eyes.	65.61030035291684
It wouldn ’ t pan out somehow.	129.83730981145277
Evening hours, girls in grey gauze.	39.57803081636272
Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks.	12.37665755805571
Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.	215.9770927410591
Still, true to life also.	26.85057071358056
Day: then the night.	766.8516528845169
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.	21.68533569215569
Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself.	37.29238014864498
He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.	72.79725091019439
In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees.	90.29686531529728
What time is the funeral?	160.70559782899136
Better find out in the paper.	150.76240594833627
The bells of George ’ s church.	200.74471816028523
They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.	166.4185794453096
Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Quarter to.	12.249938884011678
There again: the overtone following through the air.	32.837966445417514
A third.	1047.493585384237
Poor Dignam! By lorries along sir John Rogerson ’ s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past Windmill lane, Leask ’ s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office.	23.22179876781207
Could have given that address too.	29.378447396347912
And past the sailors ’ home.	93.24701326297166
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.	96.55769472515648
By Brady ’ s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt.	58.079188726593884
A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop.	30.01171332391517
Tell him if he smokes he won ’ t grow.	168.03746970114366
O let him! His life isn ’ t such a bed of roses.	117.15030265223236
Waiting outside pubs to bring da home.	26.981702957293468
Come home to ma, da.	65.09139319196296
Slack hour: won ’ t be many there.	62.538060115017096
He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel.	21.659124654894423
El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth.	24.29535860224157
And past Nichols ’ the undertaker.	65.65232373056266
At eleven it is.	783.5389676546347
Time enough.	100.87329948387531
Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O ’ Neill ’ s.	62.882169366903945
Corny.	1212.2394318801291
Met her once in the park.	54.61595547616508
What a lark.	35.416182696518696
Police tout.	178.5825216515837
Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay.	19.16083098336365
O, surely he bagged it.	74.44940640871533
Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall.	63.98879060212473
With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.	38.112614797249414
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest quality, family tea.	20.51030238312764
Rather warm.	104.48244077495224
Tea.	440.858884305153
Must get some from Tom Kernan.	27.468409645037184
Couldn ’ t ask him at a funeral, though.	32.923976767336
While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair.	26.96520972909945
Very warm morning.	63.33199639340146
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha.	61.65844418241833
Just there.	253.1118668498148
His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat.	638.3058316121854
His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.	23.44069282100633
So warm.	1620.7984609795335
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.	67.96758075511865
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands.	115.19977441853732
The far east.	431.5904733650626
Lovely spot it must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them.	17.234023383959126
Wonder is it like that.	170.9943723931013
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_, not doing a hand ’ s turn all day.	59.30980010256139
Sleep six months out of twelve.	76.64462791048824
Too hot to quarrel.	259.00504484911534
Influence of the climate.	993.2875478027383
Lethargy.	812.0832237234374
Flowers of idleness.	82.54364171518819
The air feeds most.	142.6332258767966
Azotes.	1218.4197832253003
Hothouse in Botanic gardens.	62.200804154614865
Sensitive plants.	203.07158957055697
Waterlilies.	1218.4197832253003
Petals too tired to.	75.13547723981313
Sleeping sickness in the air.	184.89402864314854
Walk on roseleaves.	54.495342889708326
Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel.	44.493703425842796
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere?	96.32758241210024
Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.	127.93366997640055
Couldn ’ t sink if you tried: so thick with salt.	70.83833462386734
Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what?	714.4538553890376
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight?	272.0908203278323
It ’ s a law something like that.	114.63024188795971
Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching.	19.436673236299146
The college curriculum.	431.5904733650626
Cracking curriculum.	203.07158957055697
What is weight really when you say the weight?	365.4197223321802
Thirtytwo feet per second per second.	128.983529308214
Law of falling bodies: per second per second.	48.00035766340016
They all fall to the ground.	451.4450998502513
The earth.	1087.0355458074223
It ’ s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.	225.19899480839524
He turned away and sauntered across the road.	47.100345715822584
How did she walk with her sausages?	45.490019397982756
Like that something.	106.80942747973866
As he walked he took the folded _Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.	35.456265959526476
Careless air: just drop in to see.	76.00800891076733
Per second per second.	50.780675728511895
Per second for every second it means.	29.633838963300164
From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice.	105.86851442601487
Too late box.	64.54034236594421
Post here.	203.1526392196045
In. He handed the card through the brass grill.	144.23383856186837
— Are there any letters for me?	140.72085477485192
he asked.	72.62503664047722
While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper.	27.840723101985613
No answer probably.	314.5824792426944
Went too far last time.	54.63242253843799
The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.	109.41967268190558
He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.	141.6006621215609
Henry Flower Esq, c / o P.	34.552752354753814
O.	1594.4374175036246
Westland Row, City.	68.02080462750696
Answered anyhow.	275.29382542023205
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing again the soldiers on parade.	22.990501824090515
Where ’ s old Tweedy ’ s regiment?	487.5017942515064
Castoff soldier.	275.29382542023205
There: bearskin cap and hackle plume.	31.82506103270342
No, he ’ s a grenadier.	1415.645627538116
Pointed cuffs.	275.29382542023205
There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.	28.973171032361698
Redcoats.	1218.4197832253003
Too showy.	1967.0133502066292
That must be why the women go after them.	45.5122004172088
Uniform.	812.0832237234374
Easier to enlist and drill.	34.17524935538088
Maud Gonne ’ s letter about taking them off O ’ Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital.	23.267656180028627
Griffith ’ s paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover empire.	40.61238545569117
Half baked they look: hypnotised like.	22.972502583473787
Mark time.	13.65116660557658
Table: able.	88.40530891686868
Bed: ed.	112.77067707425105
The King ’ s own.	943.463187192251
Never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby.	48.31765709462799
A mason, yes.	564.5173465895642
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right.	143.49933735896397
Talk: as if that would mend matters.	43.25476087868881
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.	55.80278439864697
Women will pay a lot of heed, I don ’ t think.	43.38852639522754
His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket.	42.53048366915263
Something pinned on: photo perhaps.	40.80727698658007
No. M ’ Coy.	234.2871642549867
Get rid of him quickly.	94.97059386889438
Take me out of my way.	52.24356601737172
Hate company when you.	97.75959806772947
— Hello, Bloom.	182.09746930141588
Where are you off to?	215.22295922403825
— Hello, M ’ Coy.	263.43085346238007
Nowhere in particular.	118.77434066426113
— How ’ s the body?	648.5992915845733
— Fine.	2662.837653052822
How are you?	44.199852339652466
— Just keeping alive, M ’ Coy said.	152.66381660282005
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect: — Is there any...	72.80436285817687
— O, no, Mr Bloom said.	1632.490621102847
Poor Dignam, you know.	67.22235159331265
The funeral is today.	190.338094691918
— To be sure, poor fellow.	74.30088697159897
So it is.	1618.0051589881482
What time?	948.2799940878095
A photo it isn ’ t.	203.98436986195955
A badge maybe.	328.45820040497097
— E... eleven, Mr Bloom answered.	628.7582943600556
— I must try to get out there, M ’ Coy said.	1088.9242503631344
Eleven, is it?	87.33824948653401
I only heard it last night.	80.66033485114615
Who was telling me?	26.995800937314414
Holohan.	812.0832237234374
You know Hoppy?	366.98962170282624
— I know.	1402.5061839813986
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor.	158.3821659066414
The porter hoisted the valise up on the well.	275.05957555096387
She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change.	81.34454566579019
Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth.	37.796369321334964
Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets.	46.119949490730654
Like that haughty creature at the polo match.	74.93025705321521
Women all for caste till you touch the spot.	29.772187201161447
Handsome is and handsome does.	35.92808204750835
Reserved about to yield.	111.97309142758934
The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man.	38.471963728353415
Possess her once take the starch out of her.	36.44115828816799
— I was with Bob Doran, he ’ s on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons.	363.68705221901286
Just down there in Conway ’ s we were.	1155.7491876037745
Doran Lyons in Conway ’ s.	110.05234477358694
She raised a gloved hand to her hair.	243.74143008068543
In came Hoppy.	363.0081923093229
Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums.	34.15899351184933
Clearly I can see today.	268.08562222745974
Moisture about gives long sight perhaps.	29.57863441182598
Talking of one thing or another.	42.93075301953079
Lady ’ s hand.	222.41609052311486
Which side will she get up?	26.878385026834277
— And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy? _ I said.	67.69094866421938
_Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.	142.67962645716503
High brown boots with laces dangling.	20.938190312665345
Wellturned foot.	275.55255271992644
What is he foostering over that change for?	133.84264575216383
Sees me looking.	101.6273776999849
Eye out for other fellow always.	71.55075495900567
Good fallback.	190.6205534011156
Two strings to her bow.	201.5834879892567
— _Why? _ I said.	212.63023138798474
_What ’ s wrong with him? _ I said.	138.009300117064
Proud: rich: silk stockings.	25.393473606158178
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	423.3934136213917
He moved a little to the side of M ’ Coy ’ s talking head.	283.4321534777227
Getting up in a minute.	68.22947387925352
— _What ’ s wrong with him_?	437.991481245265
He said.	680.817614986819
_He ’ s dead_, he said.	542.7370227106575
And, faith, he filled up.	303.2811028312628
_Is it Paddy Dignam_?	78.36810247478773
I said.	1017.9710574352423
I couldn ’ t believe it when I heard it.	93.25292016000427
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch.	133.4404059436446
_Yes, _ he said.	192.18918086318533
_He ’ s gone.	287.16056129010275
He died on Monday, poor fellow_.	116.73965772435302
Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white.	14.32632498509677
Watch! A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.	16.03135924776054
Lost it.	186.54864134831962
Curse your noisy pugnose.	53.832001820728955
Feels locked out of it.	170.23491234479243
Paradise and the peri.	492.22672156127567
Always happening like that.	150.84861031035084
The very moment.	509.9742750787005
Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter.	28.333930537350053
Her friend covering the display of.	28.047664043830917
_Esprit de corps_.	112.77067707425105
Well, what are you gaping at?	214.66700165732328
Another gone.	138.85747380135373
— One of the best, M ’ Coy said.	340.84767466054046
The tram passed.	431.5904733650626
They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip.	52.034919275593296
Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick.	49.56279290324626
— Wife well, I suppose?	1507.9819135485316
M ’ Coy ’ s changed voice said.	380.94900704590333
— O, yes, Mr Bloom said.	1057.1572215416525
Tiptop, thanks.	89.91812270345356
He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly: What is home without Plumtree ’ s Potted Meat?	46.244271348868175
Incomplete.	502.22953946992163
With it an abode of bliss.	51.89545903281148
— My missus has just got an engagement.	49.84384499004717
At least it ’ s not settled yet.	158.06508411261115
Valise tack again.	95.59121414957316
By the way no harm.	36.02572439428249
I ’ m off that, thanks.	92.91465256077849
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.	35.25418504870488
— My wife too, he said.	427.56534974061435
She ’ s going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.	155.28164663902567
— That so?	532.5800162132416
M ’ Coy said.	371.6135806040069
Glad to hear that, old man.	40.41159430289684
Who ’ s getting it up?	839.2892983485906
Mrs Marion Bloom.	70.58180918720721
Not up yet.	101.06839737415997
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.	182.1749194286908
No book.	1344.0689515154133
Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.	16.088770021395945
Dark lady and fair man.	8.06796051362215
Letter.	684.2060590120853
Cat furry black ball.	50.7806066977185
Torn strip of envelope.	60.98429491669431
Love ’ s Old Sweet Song Comes lo - ove ’ s old...	60.01031957227604
— It ’ s a kind of a tour, don ’ t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.	137.95809690281092
_Sweeeet song_.	275.29382542023205
There ’ s a committee formed.	111.39710007522788
Part shares and part profits.	27.571932325419247
M ’ Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.	108.08444459343114
— O, well, he said.	408.73874064100363
That ’ s good news.	141.91347553956783
He moved to go.	39.54283758267137
— Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said.	292.95079336602646
Meet you knocking around.	50.78059647831953
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	423.3934136213917
— Tell you what, M ’ Coy said.	211.0871921065634
You might put down my name at the funeral, will you?	109.1152524488269
I ’ d like to go but I mightn ’ t be able, you see.	56.959030359053315
There ’ s a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found.	20.598172738766603
You just shove in my name if I ’ m not there, will you?	117.32818112135533
— I ’ ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off.	511.103698612874
That ’ ll be all right.	46.24443034442977
— Right, M ’ Coy said brightly.	399.7354408292653
Thanks, old man.	37.236461938922226
I ’ d go if I possibly could.	178.00638181252518
Well, tolloll.	506.84688272599294
Just C.	311.7392062674492
P.	2048.366095404317
M ’ Coy will do.	463.51797834044714
— That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.	698.5217509101124
Didn ’ t catch me napping that wheeze.	52.48186979009352
The quick touch.	431.5904733650626
Soft mark.	104.48244077495224
I ’ d like my job.	318.9432846398657
Valise I have a particular fancy for.	124.33316803271565
Leather.	1218.4197832253003
Capped corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock.	14.889542755791435
Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this.	39.953406272871256
Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled.	47.38399578226508
My missus has just got an.	23.37150729771689
Reedy freckled soprano.	112.77067707425105
Cheeseparing nose.	275.29382542023205
Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad.	72.5113873860887
No guts in it.	213.87816710354403
You and me, don ’ t you know: in the same boat.	447.58752706447785
Softsoaping.	1218.4197832253003
Give you the needle that would.	168.54404325416454
Can ’ t he hear the difference?	88.64922288392393
Think he ’ s that way inclined a bit.	196.83103745035862
Against my grain somehow.	53.11162088141111
Thought that Belfast would fetch him.	19.95817742720068
I hope that smallpox up there doesn ’ t get worse.	73.33689980003531
Suppose she wouldn ’ t let herself be vaccinated again.	29.817748263583827
Your wife and my wife.	69.90674280299496
Wonder is he pimping after me?	59.997404038544104
Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings.	338.8777539438112
Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s Ginger Ale (Aromatic).	54.83265997787956
Clery ’ s Summer Sale.	419.5514366287634
No, he ’ s going on straight.	714.3163201865099
Hello.	198.81596679899442
_Leah_ tonight.	327.3813759060568
Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	114.24641629358051
_Hamlet_ she played last night.	40.69355951384852
Male impersonator.	275.29382542023205
Perhaps he was a woman.	181.11710083856343
Why Ophelia committed suicide.	220.9271068353435
Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that.	37.11294908289906
Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.	19.522923834258677
Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.	346.57918063846023
And Ristori in Vienna.	175.18220446728057
What is this the right name is?	79.35633888375918
By Mosenthal it is.	210.05550302199353
No. The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.	47.714840665997166
Nathan ’ s voice! His son ’ s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father.	50.200339774807325
Poor papa! Poor man! I ’ m glad I didn ’ t go into the room to look at his face.	27.307593373349494
That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.	99.34582174594516
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.	107.59169232800069
No use thinking of it any more.	80.56559599448028
Nosebag time.	275.3959248921919
Wish I hadn ’ t met that M ’ Coy fellow.	147.7446466367751
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth.	35.067763486512
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss.	17.46951664257616
Their Eldorado.	165.09926858425334
Poor jugginses! Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags.	15.247426932001392
Too full for words.	175.2422107759241
Still they get their feed all right and their doss.	98.13797180501476
Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches.	25.099695965308403
Might be happy all the same that way.	132.82702059999008
Good poor brutes they look.	40.20424079147044
Still their neigh can be very irritating.	30.097221943268497
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried.	54.270053249280906
Might just walk into her here.	43.90645619067673
The lane is safer.	190.338094691918
He passed the cabman ’ s shelter.	572.952244444234
Curious the life of drifting cabbies.	23.847140551269906
All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.	40.91508018145881
_Voglio e non_.	88.40530891686868
Like to give them an odd cigarette.	47.77768735825888
Sociable.	1218.4197832253003
Shout a few flying syllables as they pass.	42.14547999307447
He hummed: Là ci darem la mano La la lala la la.	20.756600181512873
He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall.	123.3438894084315
No - one.	133.58547315545061
Meade ’ s timberyard.	688.6740273116976
Piled balks.	203.07158957055697
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone.	29.11695465381056
Not a sinner.	74.77597897312586
Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.	11.027898357874554
A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill.	33.95088359556138
Pity to disturb them.	51.02790202354871
Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.	71.82475929316873
Open it.	126.37671451612431
And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame ’ s school.	73.62463318602263
She liked mignonette.	466.33660299592884
Mrs Ellis ’ s.	316.16401939158465
And Mr?	959.8207838734932
He opened the letter within the newspaper.	143.5182753075078
A flower.	1065.3710249739956
I think it ’ s a.	475.39508487033254
Not annoyed then?	101.06839737415997
What does she say?	41.14993215570947
Dear Henry I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.	23.103658320973633
I am sorry you did not like my last letter.	98.27885018629925
Why did you enclose the stamps?	270.0820061607869
I am awfully angry with you.	84.32897326377454
I do wish I could punish you for that.	68.47658721269039
I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world.	15.905522876170714
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word?	102.06385955170339
I do wish I could do something for you.	71.0445942205607
Please tell me what you think of poor me.	40.76270055450155
I often think of the beautiful name you have.	167.05518854058334
Dear Henry, when will we meet?	86.40279116874544
I think of you so often you have no idea.	244.99618379725774
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you.	85.70639662405819
Please write me a long letter and tell me more.	78.0356719389481
Remember if you do not I will punish you.	612.8467317847934
So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.	523.1590294880081
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted.	35.67663499096841
Then I will tell you all.	69.6126708881365
Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache.	32.63934708731814
today.	1218.4197832253003
and write _by return_ to your longing Martha P.	39.52238769327572
S.	189.6702203090223
Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.	26.034753637395838
I want to know.	641.6249887610172
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket.	34.176818509982155
They like it because no - one can hear.	102.73639969867666
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down.	22.49782997356657
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word.	65.4879597586455
Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don ’ t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha ’ s perfume.	19.868440385626986
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.	55.58545485540874
Weak joy opened his lips.	38.01078720319623
Changed since the first letter.	376.19033475572746
Wonder did she wrote it herself.	55.08837841083061
Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me, respectable character.	42.364460714016005
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.	23.870476983978296
Thank you: not having any.	47.56193290593777
Usual love scrimmage.	88.40530891686868
Then running round corners.	225.96570758511152
Bad as a row with Molly.	127.4911961821482
Cigar has a cooling effect.	55.42515180418864
Narcotic.	1218.4197832253003
Go further next time.	43.45399444410961
Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.	43.13418189547871
Brutal, why not?	96.49447743932562
A bit at a time.	94.24431239089434
Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.	83.16218013170791
Common pin, eh?	91.34137584128476
He threw it on the road.	266.36044012488094
Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together.	25.15515351485937
Queer the number of pins they always have.	20.402048086903847
No roses without thorns.	179.0108624264506
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head.	78.86863118380039
Those two sluts that night in the Coombe, linked together in the rain.	77.07219615080822
O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.	51.74975769329165
She didn ’ t know what to do To keep it up, To keep it up.	49.30535235530461
It?	1155.3287407379996
Them.	812.0832237234374
Such a bad headache.	49.09994462660819
Has her roses probably.	46.11687653183714
Or sitting all day typing.	200.70994281606065
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves.	47.57563739664838
What perfume does your wife use.	50.48096176940372
Now could you make out a thing like that?	139.92722418640096
To keep it up.	534.0279092252547
Martha, Mary.	70.7816132598148
I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money.	38.02221064962992
He is sitting in their house, talking.	140.018196991058
Mysterious.	812.0832237234374
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.	72.37087966836185
To keep it up.	534.0279092252547
Nice kind of evening feeling.	74.31185686614108
No more wandering about.	98.50548909347162
Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip.	17.374127474337183
Forget.	684.2060590120853
Tell about places you have been, strange customs.	96.8860549814934
The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown.	36.624353182177316
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches.	135.89673926861198
She listens with big dark soft eyes.	58.66127257721755
Tell her: more and more: all.	75.62724515265671
Then a sigh: silence.	125.72017294747235
Long long long rest.	83.79785570119734
Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road.	14.639160316053426
The shreds fluttered away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.	50.067522062166304
Henry Flower.	104.63533644070253
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way.	108.56481374678475
Simple bit of paper.	160.7937169801106
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland.	52.88864734888191
Shows you the money to be made out of porter.	172.858894148856
Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day, they say.	43.73943406235011
Skin breeds lice or vermin.	34.17524935538088
A million pounds, wait a moment.	87.57565672158616
Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.	43.24440746800115
One and four into twenty: fifteen about.	21.188474222339405
Yes, exactly.	567.5135831407184
Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.	30.046314364578397
What am I saying barrels?	128.6178959599761
Gallons.	1218.4197832253003
About a million barrels all the same.	122.5128146423567
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.	29.73860353189235
Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.	41.00916774841603
The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.	14.511262593333603
He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.	51.74564958756227
Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband.	31.279207130544897
Damn it.	102.51992514752354
I might have tried to work M ’ Coy for a pass to Mullingar.	326.33823537819245
Same notice on the door.	568.6712401241946
Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.	65.73674354370469

Prayers for the conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious.	94.31286248027882
The protestants are the same.	464.4620708170198
Convert Dr William J.	71.87205680779483
Walsh <URL>. to the true religion.	263.8342776139574
Save China ’ s millions.	262.1577705671106
Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee.	58.021868886346454
Prefer an ounce of opium.	44.898178407770196
Celestials.	1218.4197832253003
Rank heresy for them.	63.57126673862039
Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum.	191.71495617606953
Taking it easy with hand under his cheek.	10.824320887647913
Not like Ecce Homo.	43.77419720470641
Crown of thorns and cross.	40.66534266626026
Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.	34.17219939302598
Chopsticks?	1218.4197832253003
Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.	91.8266753176819
Sorry I didn ’ t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn ’ t.	58.034661029586275
He ’ s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he?	77.11841706016092
The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.	56.525485677740576
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening.	35.08218454816065
Still life.	247.40308734506473
Lap it up like milk, I suppose.	653.6097401231384
The cold smell of sacred stone called him.	48.13328544723773
He trod the worn steps, pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.	46.177834500957395
Something going on: some sodality.	49.59206529229757
Pity so empty.	71.38155314387986
Nice discreet place to be next some girl.	39.699427018975676
Who is my neighbour?	260.8609677509824
Jammed by the hour to slow music.	413.90816596037627
That woman at midnight mass.	66.74713959904886
Seventh heaven.	275.29382542023205
Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed.	27.359540542299886
A batch knelt at the altarrails.	312.13821202328876
The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands.	180.29296303441836
He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth.	35.401102506938095
Her hat and head sank.	47.27210466404374
Then the next one.	157.91373751173813
Her hat sank at once.	26.520419064458288
Then the next one: a small old woman.	77.46535406497303
The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time.	217.37154379287705
Latin.	1218.4197832253003
The next one.	443.6733042930093
Shut your eyes and open your mouth.	20.328881006646817
What?	1560.489681896445
_Corpus: _ body.	208.67910155997404
Corpse.	724.3403374961829
Good idea the Latin.	38.78589271204324
Stupefies them first.	129.53949124709393
They don ’ t seem to chew it: only swallow it down.	51.15702356133111
Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse.	53.79795773431048
Why the cannibals cotton to it.	67.22196403020642
He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, and seek their places.	60.4229314745568
He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper.	84.70340158419152
These pots we have to wear.	104.92362217282046
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads.	60.7154982637742
They were about him here and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs.	47.628090794241615
Something like those mazzoth: it ’ s that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.	70.16271764420463
Look at them.	748.4960711226503
Now I bet it makes them feel happy.	49.25100909468728
Lollipop.	1218.4197832253003
It does.	215.95012491732942
Yes, bread of angels it ’ s called.	178.9229591645149
There ’ s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel.	61.58832058675856
Hokypoky penny a lump.	69.81804203787918
Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim.	146.11508988696465
They do.	1291.9706265316322
I ’ m sure of that.	169.63487560249956
Not so lonely.	82.53098043185875
In our confraternity.	463.05680203795043
Then come out a bit spreeish.	875.4192870800001
Let off steam.	508.3602827341232
Thing is if you really believe in it.	72.6306762621706
Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.	49.72514620136991
Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox.	22.817825892679256
Hence those snores.	82.54364171518819
Blind faith.	186.38277244620522
Safe in the arms of kingdom come.	93.52269520775177
Lulls all pain.	112.77067707425105
Wake this time next year.	55.92176139594433
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on.	47.48607493214177
Suppose he lost the pin of his.	144.79688616352857
He wouldn ’ t know what to do to.	137.6867175197345
Bald spot behind.	117.21322526383237
Letters on his back: <URL>	382.3877938634807
I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is.	150.4724361132296
And the other one?	248.08041939687672
Iron nails ran in.	47.974597253884546
Meet one Sunday after the rosary.	33.463282673878
Do not deny my request.	43.37608539918893
Dusk and the light behind her.	1155.043507607977
She might be here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly.	134.66342291377802
Their character.	165.09926858425334
That fellow that turned queen ’ s evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning.	104.90078495075778
This very church.	77.07139840146337
Peter Carey, yes.	35.08223027035372
No, Peter Claver I am thinking of.	333.35769657218265
Denis Carey.	120.8946647122669
And just imagine that.	170.384573452835
Wife and six children at home.	41.72911671746881
And plotting that murder all the time.	270.6117899643822
Those crawthumpers, now that ’ s a good name for them, there ’ s always something shiftylooking about them.	98.78826531526096
They ’ re not straight men of business either.	41.54704573846089
O, no, she ’ s not here: the flower: no, no.	455.5132530165691
By the way, did I tear up that envelope?	26.745484569741087
Yes: under the bridge.	44.158572993974424
The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly.	59.874002795471576
Wine.	469.9420631433986
Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness ’ s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley ’ s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s ginger ale (aromatic).	49.443975263100526
Doesn ’ t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.	33.6410765647039
Cold comfort.	104.48244077495224
Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they ’ d have one old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink.	15.943713759202303
Queer the whole atmosphere of the.	171.45384044253598
Quite right.	78.73434169690415
Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir.	144.76916210811365
Not going to be any music.	176.47905126647194
Pity.	234.3609564447618
Who has the organ here I wonder?	133.22039330471117
Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street.	71.61789930529304
Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat Mater_ of Rossini.	211.5414255185338
Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s sermon first.	142.5620792965501
Christ or Pilate?	10.194501494954492
Christ, but don ’ t keep us all night over it.	64.93490875517826
Music they wanted.	73.27139950457459
Footdrill stopped.	275.29382542023205
Could hear a pin drop.	31.146524620832434
I told her to pitch her voice against that corner.	34.9467014225062
I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up: _Quis est <URL> Some of that old sacred music splendid.	87.52161174957666
Mercadante: seven last words.	40.66534266626026
Mozart ’ s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that.	90.74423181909894
Those old popes keen on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds.	38.79742717009768
They had a gay old time while it lasted.	58.41714056904469
Healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs.	64.8075968187764
Benedictine.	1218.4197832253003
Green Chartreuse.	116.09826509251334
Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.	93.4679778965687
What kind of voice is it?	189.6871443868404
Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.	54.66365949990527
Connoisseurs.	1218.4197832253003
Suppose they wouldn ’ t feel anything after.	218.50701043406457
Kind of a placid.	81.2331012072028
No worry.	1344.0689515154133
Fall into flesh, don ’ t they?	7.789375834834239
Gluttons, tall, long legs.	42.56702864352107
Who knows?	876.3154158740043
One way out of it.	160.82512070411775
He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people.	38.13519447447749
All crossed themselves and stood up.	43.82778925680775
Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats.	213.75065600228737
Stand up at the gospel of course.	93.0595030935069
Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench.	154.49486630177336
The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin.	96.34168509239214
Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card: — O God, our refuge and our strength...	52.73219140572629
Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words.	68.72582190013787
English.	1218.4197832253003
Throw them the bone.	71.40245562428547
I remember slightly.	419.8270757670094
How long since your last mass?	35.83654328233203
Glorious and immaculate virgin.	47.95886141701586
Joseph, her spouse.	81.15889004731481
Peter and Paul.	10.194501494954492
More interesting if you understood what it was all about.	228.11245429559165
Wonderful organisation certainly, goes like clockwork.	17.405143303870513

Punish me, please.	606.2445371040532
Great weapon in their hands.	119.30016700557265
More than doctor or solicitor.	29.455949689103434
Woman dying to.	113.36140119987233
And I schschschschschsch.	397.2038489637422
And did you chachachachacha?	299.0658764301884
And why did you?	293.30360580464406
Whispering gallery walls have ears.	32.807000850891455
Husband learn to his surprise.	88.17248819026447

Monasteries and convents.	112.77067707425105
No browbeating him.	412.97893832310154
He had his answer pat for everything.	72.29580618496871
The doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.	206.95725215416215
The priest prayed: — Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict.	49.132043918769696
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.	70.03223457741825
The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off.	310.51950669903437
All over.	264.450856642964
The women remained behind: thanksgiving.	85.57796575014625
Brother Buzz.	275.29382542023205
Come around with the plate perhaps.	81.50979146039472
Pay your Easter duty.	50.78059647831953
He stood up.	164.33234544314715
Hello.	198.81596679899442
Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time?	73.36213468352375
Women enjoy it.	67.15257978798341
Never tell you.	683.7105648067907
But we.	1139.4920273833025
Excuse, miss, there ’ s a (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff.	152.47394743885062
Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.	64.98943951782401
Glimpses of the moon.	357.4170304401104
Annoyed if you don ’ t.	389.0225016227189
Why didn ’ t you tell me before.	811.8403450182941
Still like you better untidy.	53.15844065707055
Good job it wasn ’ t farther south.	72.05472967209569
He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into the light.	91.4901313101791
He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water.	56.04887702936243
Trams: a car of Prescott ’ s dyeworks: a widow in her weeds.	60.63599136210031
Notice because I ’ m in mourning myself.	51.69382377774757
He covered himself.	562.0916029360037
How goes the time?	68.95750726823995
Quarter past.	203.27734790658042
Time enough yet.	74.01228859520894
Better get that lotion made up.	51.018820780259546
Ah yes, the last time.	677.1059210828489
Sweny ’ s in Lincoln place.	209.1425884541962

Visit some day.	155.66671477778968
He walked southward along Westland row.	195.82374255028023
But the recipe is in the other trousers.	171.19465816745614
O, and I forgot that latchkey too.	218.17743605196478
Bore this funeral affair.	50.78059647831953
O well, poor fellow, it ’ s not his fault.	112.49349006695233
When was it I got it made up last?	669.8692528502105
Wait.	199.9002065950114
I changed a sovereign I remember.	83.22443341639233
First of the month it must have been or the second.	93.89134107320547
O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.	531.5969690262958
The chemist turned back page after page.	59.34855359395169
Sandy shrivelled smell he seems to have.	39.902936263128204

— About a fortnight ago, sir?	330.53393630424654
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	423.3934136213917
He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs.	46.25910115621267
Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains.	41.503070081306376
— Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then orangeflower water...	111.79089097347364
It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.	16.263788560333214
— And white wax also, he said.	529.649117506201
Brings out the darkness of her eyes.	70.81417935064552

Yes I.	1671.1027830645066
Do it in the bath.	682.5903414377478
Curious longing I.	58.539846412648316
Water to water.	83.31411369878325
Combine business with pleasure.	80.25587370445008
Pity no time for massage.	52.06880486755896
Feel fresh then all the day.	106.09550252191188
Funeral be rather glum.	53.832001820728955
That was two and nine.	156.34812405411677
Have you brought a bottle?	78.4524572712026
— No, Mr Bloom said.	917.9517167545029
Make it up, please.	247.7446573099481
I ’ ll call later in the day and I ’ ll take one of these soaps.	140.89074285811947
— Fourpence, sir.	1184.8180707000806
Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils.	56.58539612638901
Sweet lemony wax.	51.95096976857479
— I ’ ll take this one, he said.	395.61674688348313
That makes three and a penny.	68.26807509692675
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	374.31298649220736
You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.	339.9473748445087
— Good, Mr Bloom said.	678.0448365180162
He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.	152.2476223022845
At his armpit Bantam Lyons ’ voice and hand said: — Hello, Bloom.	55.4343306184358
What ’ s the best news?	141.06761577136808
Is that today ’ s?	206.3760662999157
Show us a minute.	16.525632700375695
Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip.	51.34162331748406
He does look balmy.	147.45920303331457
Younger than I am.	90.47694678476962
Bantam Lyons ’ s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton.	52.962986754415375
Wants a wash too.	12.271528489978598
Take off the rough dirt.	47.51042748842149
Good morning, have you used Pears ’ soap?	60.705366429817474
Dandruff on his shoulders.	463.0656326868408
Scalp wants oiling.	112.77067707425105
— I want to see about that French horse that ’ s running today, Bantam Lyons said.	106.36254503759885
Where the bugger is it?	106.38088870027833
He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.	55.39685060632393
Barber ’ s itch.	946.8552069838712
Tight collar he ’ ll lose his hair.	58.35642974293907
Better leave him the paper and get shut of him.	29.81725709525693
— You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.	627.8545399890752
— Ascot.	3933.1036573861734
Gold cup.	90.19186305649968
Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered.	56.94916466648384
Half a mo.	57.863283101412186
Maximum the second.	174.7669059804913
— I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.	202.9336084098242
Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.	67.636680145866
— What ’ s that?	399.7624183592977
his sharp voice said.	63.61393205027196
— I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered.	1003.6904823532801
I was going to throw it away that moment.	127.5175828472151
Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom ’ s arms.	57.67829535546006
— I ’ ll risk it, he said.	633.8625059861774
Here, thanks.	77.68596278939697
He sped off towards Conway ’ s corner.	129.56562158445536
God speed scut.	84.62467607185057
Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it, smiling.	75.3259929957343
Silly lips of that chap.	272.4145261089506
Betting.	812.0832237234374
Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence.	100.47995657510286
Raffle for large tender turkey.	40.66534266626026
Your Christmas dinner for threepence.	32.156523423097056
Jack Fleming embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America.	15.515288276984586
Keeps a hotel now.	50.78059647831953
They never come back.	613.0538747511506
Fleshpots of Egypt.	245.78144101762987
He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths.	427.88839244006175
Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets.	66.80294045176642
He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot.	34.14162034210353
Damn bad ad.	65.2250498025695
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.	174.22022401166018
Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.	25.24057922422129
Something to catch the eye.	35.73707598029834
There ’ s Hornblower standing at the porter ’ s lodge.	293.95185367151043
Keep him on hands: might take a turn in there on the nod.	40.380749147130544
How do you do, Mr Hornblower?	163.1713135482665
How do you do, sir?	514.6471749019665
Heavenly weather really.	112.77067707425105
If life was always like that.	139.99543478212854
Cricket weather.	275.29382542023205
Sit around under sunshades.	38.19763055544207
Over after over.	69.3625448499663
Out.	503.4838481820751
They can ’ t play it here.	173.47231259582944
Duck for six wickets.	69.81804203787918
Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg.	30.081290767584274
Donnybrook fair more in their line.	67.92470477598418
And the skulls we were acracking when M ’ Carthy took the floor.	49.24490171261979
Heatwave.	1218.4197832253003
Won ’ t last.	331.7715569091902
Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.	40.47764807658096
Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream.	29.65573977653548
This is my body.	108.16528046594651
He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.	28.52887310539703
He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.	19.613649796074654
Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.	41.83847280613453
— Come on, Simon.	142.00637849590566
— After you, Mr Bloom said.	302.23943242592156
Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying: — Yes, yes.	89.40926613362011
— Are we all here now?	213.77285549143818
Martin Cunningham asked.	333.1275970668318
Come along, Bloom.	68.19808943474258
Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place.	226.82096659557982
He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight.	74.51140738629613
He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue.	89.18137992368112
One dragged aside: an old woman peeping.	28.51300990902182
Thanking her stars she was passed over.	60.97663453643321
Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.	47.41504630089213
Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming.	35.736791791598534
Job seems to suit them.	68.65557298495709
Huggermugger in corners.	113.7519241812023
Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he ’ d wake.	39.00945219892979
Then getting it ready.	262.97930707773315
Laying it out.	479.86313334163293
Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed.	28.125189320603415
Pull it more to your side.	57.02357925693857
Our windingsheet.	171.86428112536083
Never know who will touch you dead.	23.33918126855017
Wash and shampoo.	112.77067707425105
I believe they clip the nails and the hair.	92.90303538001415
Keep a bit in an envelope.	152.86171943820838
Grows all the same after.	896.4180774341366
Unclean job.	275.29382542023205
All waited.	164.03638011831268
Nothing was said.	86.4299859562072
Stowing in the wreaths probably.	401.5750926791682
I am sitting on something hard.	88.62512954178024
Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket.	308.89607700628613
Better shift it out of that.	246.87866910821865
Wait for an opportunity.	616.0623039794752
All waited.	164.03638011831268
Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses ’ hoofs.	85.16809654174149
A jolt.	1047.493585384237
Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.	26.918131533656023
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind.	18.401952104556432
The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.	34.39018953473246
At walking pace.	623.8629636488142
They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks.	34.74003118658731
Tritonville road.	327.70089540244305
Quicker.	812.0832237234374
The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.	81.17581306690055
— What way is he taking us?	171.69074327922203
Mr Power asked through both windows.	28.521708648301388
— Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said.	317.96132164921966
Ringsend.	812.0832237234374
Brunswick street.	544.4990662575527
Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.	105.92738948827464
— That ’ s a fine old custom, he said.	188.74958071519924
I am glad to see it has not died out.	227.92688288091014
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.	13.91407435536177
Respect.	812.0832237234374
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane.	52.777641369825126
Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.	58.610235307965844
— There ’ s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.	192.06723821098018
— Who is that?	298.3856014613848
— Your son and heir.	195.34310776157554
— Where is he?	167.41924009116752
Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.	88.21102275125259
The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.	21.59073471310061
Mr Dedalus fell back, saying: — Was that Mulligan cad with him?	65.5145314858025
His _fidus Achates_! — No, Mr Bloom said.	272.5773943872205
— Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa ’ s little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.	65.20950428916026
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road.	45.110287425712244
Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.	31.365717151681395
Richie Goulding and the legal bag.	175.52276936787936
Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm.	20.263565466722213
His jokes are getting a bit damp.	229.2846119934507
Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady ’ s two hats pinned on his head.	94.71591025531187
Out on the rampage all night.	168.48939810362867
Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear.	184.2959537728757
Wife ironing his back.	144.11232436964409
Thinks he ’ ll cure it with pills.	277.52873419617544
All breadcrumbs they are.	61.9045462803814
About six hundred per cent profit.	27.82704502239605
— He ’ s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.	334.57768269402254
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts.	24.179227768674597
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I ’ ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.	37.6051138380347
I ’ ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.	48.5567897466681
He cried above the clatter of the wheels: — I won ’ t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son.	95.28666040885781
A counterjumper ’ s son.	410.72601176578075
Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M ’ Swiney ’ s.	82.05481269202906
Not likely.	240.06036372529834
He ceased.	1765.056033590813
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power ’ s mild face and Martin Cunningham ’ s eyes and beard, gravely shaking.	68.64042855525852
Noisy selfwilled man.	112.81723245736762
Full of his son.	278.35633683169885
He is right.	469.4444694318419
Something to hand on.	83.30710455633417
If little Rudy had lived.	52.96796532243567
See him grow up.	212.32866305570158
Hear his voice in the house.	538.1240695239462
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit.	24.727868064034976
My son.	135.129294957173
Me in his eyes.	704.4123788700979
Strange feeling it would be.	66.29233216539726
From me.	291.13811529475606
Just a chance.	65.3604802184717
Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil.	166.3782483188475
And the sergeant grinning up.	82.07446732777156
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched.	37.769998794654164
Give us a touch, Poldy.	38.75633633575219
God, I ’ m dying for it.	133.00036975543432
How life begins.	127.50319222971828
Got big then.	84.78077836390982
Had to refuse the Greystones concert.	20.521443369635374
My son inside her.	59.18761153523763
I could have helped him on in life.	251.11911819781227
I could.	875.5722407359705
Make him independent.	755.8378614636663
Learn German too.	79.76826981558858
— Are we late?	381.60128400221527
Mr Power asked.	106.4642572475719
— Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.	183.64112437287497
Molly.	405.1642248429805
Milly.	292.57084530121165
Same thing watered down.	36.40184732587846
Her tomboy oaths.	78.1652503040716
O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she ’ s a dear girl.	49.46585710188966
Soon be a woman.	83.17661265422986
Mullingar.	502.22953946992163
Dearest Papli.	203.07158957055697
Young student.	82.37378319234055
Yes, yes: a woman too.	93.47570682994628
Life, life.	70.40391628754172
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.	109.08582809736006
— Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.	64.98730406932829
— He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn ’ t that squint troubling him.	115.22826669820928
Do you follow me?	176.51788536496755
He closed his left eye.	199.278457169517
Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.	93.73825846922307
— What is this, he said, in the name of God?	369.78303264711315
Crumbs?	812.0832237234374
— Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.	50.945980165534074
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats.	25.74919320057281
Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said: — Unless I ’ m greatly mistaken.	51.844618635224336
What do you think, Martin?	263.7461043589741
— It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.	147.08246133082656
Mr Bloom set his thigh down.	112.1820288515186
Glad I took that bath.	39.01055683139738
Feel my feet quite clean.	36.2777914191352
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.	26.147460545558037
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.	64.65573180777076
— After all, he said, it ’ s the most natural thing in the world.	418.0783708463042
— Did Tom Kernan turn up?	196.62429520676406
Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.	81.812585508163
— Yes, Mr Bloom answered.	607.3161064537368
He ’ s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.	228.592940229394
— And Corny Kelleher himself?	957.4179528496223
— At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.	169.3650225971017
— I met M ’ Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said.	1671.875767393081
He said he ’ d try to come.	75.73869815729599
The carriage halted short.	111.79068319355093
— What ’ s wrong?	783.4888044691318
— We ’ re stopped.	777.5509890637236
— Where are we?	334.1452377986137
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.	150.2467651545761
— The grand canal, he said.	315.65214559582614
Whooping cough they say it cures.	225.364611824447
Good job Milly never got it.	27.007239846549993
Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions.	19.547688472297025
Shame really.	186.38277244620522
Only measles.	171.97790624687732
Flaxseed tea.	275.29382542023205
Scarlatina, influenza epidemics.	62.200804154614865
Canvassing for death.	129.63055028056263
Don ’ t miss this chance.	102.30160306556469
Dogs ’ home over there.	37.88595998539668
Thy will be done.	101.09133782274392
We obey them in the grave.	397.2803791819871
A dying scrawl.	328.45820040497097
He took it to heart, pined away.	563.8733688019329
Quiet brute.	203.07158957055697
Old men ’ s dogs usually are.	112.57318512909573
A raindrop spat on his hat.	1131.1151779329696
He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags.	38.0234449663706
Apart.	1218.4197832253003
Curious.	362.578692018612
Like through a colander.	104.35032288426778
I thought it would.	5333.533135150822
My boots were creaking I remember now.	36.45141902291378
— The weather is changing, he said quietly.	238.59314811120112
— A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.	51.99861958449569
— Wanted for the country, Mr Power said.	404.26064306112914
There ’ s the sun again coming out.	318.72694142643735
Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.	30.44715187972017
— We ’ re off again.	417.6563372978801
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.	19.460300747198975
— Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.	508.60457154537113
And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.	101.75484842205086
— O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly.	121.96474675854569
Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard ’ s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.	120.2851987953857
— Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously.	356.8783801359369
_His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my <URL> — Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing.	54.24636625005444
And the retrospective arrangement.	152.26919337126427
— Did you read Dan Dawson ’ s speech?	147.42423738443935
Martin Cunningham asked.	333.1275970668318
— I did not then, Mr Dedalus said.	296.6351653385829
Where is it?	2703.3244994092684
— In the paper this morning.	173.09804230582097
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket.	88.54673741956358
That book I must change for her.	83.15969995179854
Later on please.	129.53949124709393
Mr Bloom ’ s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that?	26.362459606162258
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne ’ s?	81.08270823627272
no, Sexton, Urbright.	284.8868154605728
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.	59.15448835227488
Thanks to the Little Flower.	200.5403493712437
Sadly missed.	186.38277244620522
To the inexpressible grief of his.	55.1734196618334
Aged <NUM> after a long and tedious illness.	53.28258685264098
Month ’ s mind: Quinlan.	173.8332936996574
On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.	232.1454801561309
It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high.	24.502619742913403
I tore up the envelope?	1200.7431558590624
Yes.	1763.135277433406
Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath?	78.54150230373415
He patted his waistcoatpocket.	214.6696675455129
There all right.	107.8062634929281
Dear Henry fled.	60.34915595651243
Before my patience are exhausted.	29.885882060362267
National school.	275.29382542023205
Meade ’ s yard.	72.6354800584472
The hazard.	1473.6388010057888
Only two there now.	45.45485729662465
Nodding.	1218.4197832253003
Full as a tick.	392.5082686720648
Too much bone in their skulls.	114.6152643911741
The other trotting round with a fare.	89.21004782582168
An hour ago I was passing there.	116.51717312280401
The jarvies raised their hats.	137.00255264165477
A pointsman ’ s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom ’ s window.	62.383802304839335
Couldn ’ t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier?	25.276898233477908
Well but that fellow would lose his job then?	24.764885717577695
Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?	22.555728018639634
Antient concert rooms.	112.77067707425105
Nothing on there.	69.45898206124637
A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet.	59.292725415503554
Not much grief there.	43.84223453505166
Quarter mourning.	203.07158957055697
People in law perhaps.	34.99924264153658
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark ’ s, under the railway bridge, past the Queen ’ s theatre: in silence.	36.595028878247994
Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	31.055495922450316
Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I wonder.	87.82442966150681
I said I.	661.3399131047494
Or the _Lily of Killarney_?	72.60874169344766
Elster Grimes Opera Company.	69.81804203787918
Big powerful change.	76.09784659314117
Wet bright bills for next week.	29.13146124059867
_Fun on the Bristol_.	676.8330752555285
Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety.	197.80076040508072
Have to stand a drink or two.	35.09143830066212
As broad as it ’ s long.	181.33908461490483
He ’ s coming in the afternoon.	1134.923933322451
Her songs.	174.10786477101323
Plasto ’ s.	804.0366525215602
Sir Philip Crampton ’ s memorial fountain bust.	73.2334916999304
Who was he?	76.32738647041154
— How do you do?	356.12646544237197
Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.	40.79387555399349
— He doesn ’ t see us, Mr Power said.	396.769126490605
Yes, he does.	1321.6738040031883
How do you do?	120.64071265658458
— Who?	969.1116642327058
Mr Dedalus asked.	48.512604837671255
— Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said.	349.26888797268305
There he is airing his quiff.	38.110540216857885
Just that moment I was thinking.	60.34264669940081
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute.	45.10672028608738
From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.	35.72350790990892
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand.	211.65014046594786
The nails, yes.	795.5645228143675
Is there anything more in him that they she sees?	36.52333658333638
Fascination.	1218.4197832253003
Worst man in Dublin.	90.29441403451818
That keeps him alive.	60.20858556922266
They sometimes feel what a person is.	77.93376959560464
Instinct.	644.5508818121558
But a type like that.	57.020298726002224
My nails.	183.0162153306878
I am just looking at them: well pared.	62.78853824438394
And after: thinking alone.	82.36261541582951
Body getting a bit softy.	230.20876158190484
I would notice that: from remembering.	71.68255375791836
I suppose the skin can ’ t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off.	83.64620874499248
But the shape is there.	168.02133894555442
The shape is there still.	158.65056263673839
Shoulders.	1218.4197832253003
Hips.	1218.4197832253003
Plump.	1218.4197832253003
Night of the dance dressing.	289.4610417618451
Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.	50.73334303887424
He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.	35.52074534922591
Mr Power asked: — How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?	254.15203648027847
— O, very well, Mr Bloom said.	325.1621784065965
I hear great accounts of it.	146.54823336682202
It ’ s a good idea, you see...	88.95975325664105
— Are you going yourself?	148.65526718860858
— Well no, Mr Bloom said.	1417.3118716259548
In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business.	99.33648912849632
You see the idea is to tour the chief towns.	28.1512249725294
What you lose on one you can make up on the other.	123.22038248516894
— Quite so, Martin Cunningham said.	661.7202999415248
Mary Anderson is up there now.	41.48230350365881
Have you good artists?	81.49001284935821
— Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said.	144.38280524480493
O yes, we ’ ll have all topnobbers.	48.263197812296156
J.	129.7375304578709
C.	213.99259247746502
Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and.	47.42746445058191
The best, in fact.	130.17906982508197
— And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling.	483.2486198856993
Last but not least.	54.46699524826598
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them.	38.792966528479305
Smith O ’ Brien.	260.86402413193196
Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.	16.110644417853045
Woman.	234.3609564447618
Must be his deathday.	72.80794324282749
For many happy returns.	61.39999569058261
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.	57.33896736208463
— Four bootlaces for a penny.	317.08407142830407
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls.	142.006393722737
Had his office in Hume street.	28.420330566754046
Same house as Molly ’ s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.	29.20232377326
Has that silk hat ever since.	45.89229115242861
Relics of old decency.	104.70686786123922
Mourning too.	203.07158957055697
Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.	17.029563053343225
O ’ Callaghan on his last legs.	523.6874953916415
Twenty past eleven.	64.18962834540521
Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.	44.27251344355878
Doing her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_.	15.283269310252855
No: _vorrei e non_.	81.1268234851664
Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split.	65.74586929069602
_Mi trema un poco il_.	44.898178407770196
Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone.	28.04444481552478
A thrush.	649.7504229134231
A throstle.	649.7504229134231
There is a word throstle that expresses that.	37.67782556420945
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power ’ s goodlooking face.	63.76309131960295
Greyish over the ears.	123.76801120183
_Madame_: smiling.	112.77067707425105
I smiled back.	1506.8355467932033
A smile goes a long way.	103.17223554206214
Only politeness perhaps.	77.45133473822631
Nice fellow.	155.8075024411035
Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps?	195.36177488336338
Not pleasant for the wife.	364.1568334801432
Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal.	308.01343154913
You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick.	42.09942399650761
Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak.	34.73124614053752
What is this she was?	114.17002044418929
Barmaid in Jury ’ s.	165.4120140740218
They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator ’ s form.	164.95691924074663
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.	236.24342418995724
— Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.	164.57068397675255
A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery ’ s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.	59.41897304401375
— In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.	107.23751156388028
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly: — The devil break the hasp of your back! Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray ’ s statue.	38.557854264218335
— We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.	331.7393294907858
His eyes met Mr Bloom ’ s eyes.	224.6380273681973
He caressed his beard, adding: — Well, nearly all of us.	174.6009331790052
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions ’ faces.	78.733319668447
— That ’ s an awfully good one that ’ s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.	96.46784881685176
— Yes.	1061.8201792287966
Isn ’ t it awfully good?	84.60092132504279
— What is that?	608.1282922354048
Mr Dedalus asked.	48.512604837671255
I didn ’ t hear it.	146.37279533238566
— There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm ’ s way but when they were both.....	189.56662979322186
— What?	1096.145065448642
Mr Dedalus asked.	48.512604837671255
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?	29.270892344665075
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown.....	112.90973660671668
— Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried.	181.549233052049
I wish to Christ he did! Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.	35.88494824969565
— No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....	279.9320706571575
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely: — Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.	94.49928367524842
— For God ’ s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright.	135.503011043434
Is he dead?	80.01034687019325
— Dead! Martin Cunningham cried.	527.2128329479577
Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive.	85.82304017847403
Half the town was there.	37.987328897775726
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	423.3934136213917
But the funny part is.....	41.812622818280936
— And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son ’ s life.	138.093472893695
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power ’ s hand.	211.78614054774224
— O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed.	175.5364496799944
Like a hero.	93.53904590634079
A silver florin.	328.45820040497097
— Isn ’ t it awfully good?	263.6223718376776
Mr Bloom said eagerly.	213.35995735307793
— One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.	50.24350895676662
Mr Power ’ s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.	108.62506830377531
Nelson ’ s pillar.	99.86623537057794
— Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny! — We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.	65.08878502870671
Mr Dedalus sighed.	118.13250862019603
— Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn ’ t grudge us a laugh.	239.1488668371871
Many a good one he told himself.	94.8826157416797
— The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers.	66.45632014120199
Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I ’ d be driving after him like this.	66.20116263274161
He ’ s gone from us.	236.03052452972548
— As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said.	58.62949583174198
He went very suddenly.	137.37380111524968
— Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said.	317.96132164921966
Heart.	243.07374709781274
He tapped his chest sadly.	119.35409298971487
Blazing face: redhot.	78.3681024747878
Too much John Barleycorn.	140.2557258650023
Cure for a red nose.	340.4939137408424
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite.	37.3749767425116
A lot of money he spent colouring it.	49.8044386841604
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.	59.8387062753577
— He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.	238.0141685417188
— The best death, Mr Bloom said.	308.49066269529277
Their wide open eyes looked at him.	28.418135085907288
— No suffering, he said.	690.8591439190965
A moment and all is over.	243.28908024549818
Like dying in sleep.	79.12077358329363
No - one spoke.	694.1479298434438
Dead side of the street this.	629.0687773450326
Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer ’ s railway guide, civil service college, Gill ’ s, catholic club, the industrious blind.	38.33950665884114
Why?	2421.489910325178
Some reason.	148.0767188762466
Sun or wind.	88.40530891686868
At night too.	439.30564822879853
Chummies and slaveys.	112.77067707425105
Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew.	50.251150903290785
Foundation stone for Parnell.	70.61018315444637
Breakdown.	1218.4197832253003
Heart.	243.07374709781274
White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping.	31.218059196849442
A tiny coffin flashed by.	73.92994278120666
In a hurry to bury.	144.0535655520255
A mourning coach.	328.45820040497097
Unmarried.	1218.4197832253003
Black for the married.	407.11179669412195
Piebald for bachelors.	129.53949124709393
Dun for a nun.	788.3488196197975
— Sad, Martin Cunningham said.	261.62481964877946
A child.	805.7918238771582
A dwarf ’ s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy ’ s was.	87.7341598322621
Dwarf ’ s body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box.	48.76521932538895
Burial friendly society pays.	62.200804154614865
Penny a week for a sod of turf.	29.095821135012418
Our.	343.9083710559954

Beggar.	684.2060590120853
Baby.	1218.4197832253003
Meant nothing.	275.29382542023205
Mistake of nature.	82.54383616772645
If it ’ s healthy it ’ s from the mother.	241.42451776880026
If not from the man.	377.5703047667637
Better luck next time.	46.492810816040624
— Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said.	209.97638690922804
It ’ s well out of it.	54.79751467730505
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square.	25.30405997825118
Rattle his bones.	77.01444579329984
Over the stones.	50.53674021513536
Only a pauper.	54.74836091127807
Nobody owns.	11.047826562953352
— In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.	83.97389781314705
— But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.	94.86645380490737
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.	41.4273118530797
— The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.	226.99747428951838
— Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.	224.25633870020403
We must take a charitable view of it.	133.10052056510617
— They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.	99.46817061161154
— It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.	252.1502292577589
Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again.	138.97634647126884
Looking away now.	90.44556233214165
Sympathetic human man he is.	46.72687216503314
Intelligent.	1218.4197832253003
Like Shakespeare ’ s face.	209.96435615687804
Always a good word to say.	310.66273999883447
They have no mercy on that here or infanticide.	27.499235936785016
Refuse christian burial.	112.77067707425105
They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave.	118.82168152873429
Yet sometimes they repent too late.	27.839329420033458
Found in the riverbed clutching rushes.	188.24527181774985
He looked at me.	131.09242756078697
And that awful drunkard of a wife of his.	125.08097484443184
Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost.	56.878531918887376
Leading him the life of the damned.	208.26796504847337
Monday morning.	203.2276483575797
Start afresh.	275.29382542023205
Shoulder to the wheel.	458.0047387321681
Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there.	128.9949546544229
Drunk about the place and capering with Martin ’ s umbrella.	64.94760886014157
And they call me the jewel of Asia, Of Asia, The geisha.	40.335381801385914
He looked away from me.	689.3192846698635
He knows.	782.205767152748
Rattle his bones.	77.01444579329984
That afternoon of the inquest.	425.0974579303865
The redlabelled bottle on the table.	239.04050527762115
The room in the hotel with hunting pictures.	163.2513821620393
Stuffy it was.	167.0543501645533
Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind.	363.64667461437585
The coroner ’ s sunlit ears, big and hairy.	130.9709409522099
Boots giving evidence.	112.77067707425105
Thought he was asleep first.	196.65912137083762
Then saw like yellow streaks on his face.	111.65184021160032
Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.	206.27658773967423
Verdict: overdose.	112.77067707425105
Death by misadventure.	10.194501494954492
The letter.	1087.0355458074223
For my son Leopold.	68.05553929906768
No more pain.	195.65072826047037
Wake no more.	413.04355425321717
Nobody owns.	11.047826562953352
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street.	34.11527077934695
Over the stones.	50.53674021513536
— We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.	411.3668551100556
— I hope not, Martin Cunningham said.	365.14726966110914
That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany.	60.39975662552195
The Gordon Bennett.	454.5674038753851
— Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said.	165.9813435642637
That will be worth seeing, faith.	123.0630658490497
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls.	26.484234377996714
Has anybody here seen Kelly?	26.429168920654753
Kay ee double ell wy.	34.17524935538088
Dead March from <URL> He ’ s as bad as old Antonio.	34.42017434101781
He left me on my ownio.	648.9814485740101
Pirouette! The _Mater Misericordiae_.	70.26859488606418
Eccles street.	317.4373296407546
My house down there.	47.45354570503223
Big place.	168.37076879752516
Ward for incurables there.	48.033402884491586
Deadhouse handy underneath.	112.77067707425105
Where old Mrs Riordan died.	186.20432444673662
They look terrible the women.	130.00580001349184
Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon.	38.576192026164776
Then the screen round her bed for her to die.	130.09817144600953
Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me.	77.29069669667574
He ’ s gone over to the lying - in hospital they told me.	82.8630181481459
From one extreme to the other.	92.71393211196508
The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.	42.18434083114503
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups.	10.722511413042087
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.	8.584619052256038
— Emigrants, Mr Power said.	333.73794673562594
— Huuuh! the drover ’ s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.	141.93837888461775
Huuuh! out of that! Thursday, of course.	148.82108207571795
Tomorrow is killing day.	50.8006310610301
Springers.	1218.4197832253003
Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each.	24.921650196365224
For Liverpool probably.	110.16320332167727
Roastbeef for old England.	87.9652208259691
They buy up all the juicy ones.	190.83999638542616
And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns.	21.164671350529385
Comes to a big thing in a year.	954.5790113702392
Dead meat trade.	58.174189759773085
Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine.	61.545333384704506
Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.	13.402134426881966
The carriage moved on through the drove.	155.04083385177714
— I can ’ t make out why the corporation doesn ’ t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.	153.68943650112385
All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.	65.01377294416214
— Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.	186.7137108835959
Quite right.	78.73434169690415
They ought to.	555.4512868605914
Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all.	18.395925344101855
Don ’ t you see what I mean?	320.67441923552775
— O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.	305.98873400636074
Pullman car and saloon diningroom.	55.660204126973376
— A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.	95.99015313850295
Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus.	107.32830056878898
Wouldn ’ t it be more decent than galloping two abreast?	34.15927814359804
— Well, there ’ s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.	713.4338746006713
— And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn ’ t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy ’ s and upset the coffin on to the road.	153.33098546207876
— That was terrible, Mr Power ’ s shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road.	535.0731621891307
Gordon Bennett cup.	118.77434066426113
— Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.	165.89079515587758
Bom! Upset.	112.77067707425105
A coffin bumped out on to the road.	322.79999844443967
Burst open.	203.07158957055697
Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him.	54.42814101909094
Red face: grey now.	31.75378096748215
Mouth fallen open.	11.652432511887907
Asking what ’ s up now.	150.86253408353048
Quite right to close it.	55.19610420897897
Looks horrid open.	63.32473140808216
Then the insides decompose quickly.	81.8925838462792
Much better to close up all the orifices.	95.26103611323487
Yes, also.	706.969229170456
With wax.	1593.8067344417275
The sphincter loose.	443.6733042930093
Seal up all.	275.362220075761
— Dunphy ’ s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.	182.6680111216845
Dunphy ’ s corner.	444.95038058439843
Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.	32.9615461696135
A pause by the wayside.	611.4367581196659
Tiptop position for a pub.	239.45334624749935
Expect we ’ ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health.	94.57867179257121
Pass round the consolation.	464.7814463336311
But suppose now it did happen.	89.8190079036631
Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about?	60.97037348665827
He would and he wouldn ’ t, I suppose.	812.7152824371311
Depends on where.	88.40530891686868
The circulation stops.	431.5904733650626
Still some might ooze out of an artery.	51.264078319608686
It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.	35.30278668960531
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road.	55.49143269589133
An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.	38.89132826520386
Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.	59.593000122167574
Water rushed roaring through the sluices.	133.62106090860723
A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf.	49.715147802883315
On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse.	97.72257583406828
Aboard of the <URL> Their eyes watched him.	45.99873453731009
On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.	26.264059014415487
Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal.	122.40918065571717
Or cycle down.	481.7259275370117
Hire some old crock, safety.	31.768083746711085
Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady ’ s.	81.95441248216
Developing waterways.	275.29382542023205
James M ’ Cann ’ s hobby to row me o ’ er the ferry.	58.30643211141996
Cheaper transit.	275.29382542023205
By easy stages.	100.50942446733762
Houseboats.	1218.4197832253003
Camping out.	1682.309783511701
Also hearses.	281.1286949984827
To heaven by water.	250.7267501852725
Perhaps I will without writing.	170.75989103900264
Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla.	79.59305761937117
Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin.	23.71627811175523
With turf from the midland bogs.	159.16336362125108
Salute.	1218.4197832253003
He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.	31.196246701337962
They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house.	45.286208162919685
Near it now.	69.28638287438255
— I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.	114.14964696906306
— Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.	106.54926866748326
— How is that?	198.99491101322474
Martin Cunningham said.	186.94174767915294
Left him weeping, I suppose?	316.5342831622535
— Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.	163.7723091001171
The carriage steered left for Finglas road.	34.123773594126305
The stonecutter ’ s yard on the right.	157.68279632651706
Last lap.	112.71204099370946
Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing.	19.7503139218666
Fragments of shapes, hewn.	44.898178407770196
In white silence: appealing.	144.06515732729468
The best obtainable.	319.21834136461086
Thos.	1218.4197832253003
H.	194.40360032537305
Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.	29.566217255787716
Passed.	1218.4197832253003
On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton ’ s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot.	50.36499960260534
After life ’ s journey.	338.5711270274726
Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.	40.86604207398028
Mr Power pointed.	145.4508926979749
— That is where Childs was murdered, he said.	130.5159442215885
The last house.	198.93191720875686
— So it is, Mr Dedalus said.	132.36830937637677
A gruesome case.	328.45820040497097
Seymour Bushe got him off.	121.95783354276797
Murdered his brother.	184.6035328237892
Or so they said.	267.40097202415456
— The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.	88.2530139242225
— Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added.	242.96930066311631
That ’ s the maxim of the law.	204.57256098960409
Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.	16.880813150291395
They looked.	953.027291504828
Murderer ’ s ground.	452.7437306297469
It passed darkly.	85.6295234880089
Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden.	29.581373857760397
Whole place gone to hell.	70.90241413663777
Wrongfully condemned.	275.29382542023205
Murder.	812.0832237234374
The murderer ’ s image in the eye of the murdered.	793.7614283924265
They love reading about it.	98.43225939044471
Man ’ s head found in a garden.	143.56700099787426
Her clothing consisted of.	51.6526067718064
Recent outrage.	275.29382542023205
Murderer is still at large.	64.50579512519148
Clues.	1218.4197832253003
A shoelace.	1047.493585384237
The body to be exhumed.	309.1423982199817
Murder will out.	376.154226516335
Cramped in this carriage.	113.56078017407793
She mightn ’ t like me to come that way without letting her know.	100.16330315880677
Must be careful about women.	43.26588134223948
Catch them once with their pants down.	37.04444976078801
Never forgive you after.	410.43771204945887
Fifteen.	215.1483861869542
The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze.	28.591028833539198
Dark poplars, rare white forms.	7.178449376152398
Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.	15.403419129979891
The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped.	77.06164674172508
Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee.	48.581571498158425
He stepped out.	1312.9344256975837
Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.	150.99733362908879
Change that soap now.	53.832001820728955
Mr Bloom ’ s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.	27.01781599169158
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.	59.74638700390152
Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages.	27.592582671092067
It ’ s all the same.	735.8462475466646
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley.	17.890551877070678
Pomp of death.	127.05691392178068
Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit.	13.405403966936342
Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.	38.62837208141166
Dogbiscuits.	1218.4197832253003
Who ate them?	365.1240281175234
Mourners coming out.	802.1683748348869
He followed his companions.	187.50852835663326
Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them.	58.49064052815702
Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths.	50.92372571794844
He handed one to the boy.	327.0503187511475
Where is that child ’ s funeral disappeared to?	380.23781809942744
A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block.	16.977370466748816
The waggoner marching at their head saluted.	59.818312971615605
Coffin now.	275.29382542023205
Got here before us, dead as he is.	39.88606129565501
Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways.	101.00527869215685
Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something.	33.316248810837045
Do they know what they cart out here every day?	216.49064081198227
Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day.	17.47880492340549
Then Mount Jerome for the protestants.	551.186778294633
Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute.	107.99201990446383
Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.	113.28817747740216
Too many in the world.	1562.962979972993
Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl.	82.45639639534377
Leanjawed harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry.	22.861278658537373
Girl ’ s face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman ’ s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.	49.89364941187958
The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates.	135.8286695433328
So much dead weight.	177.1473680972515
Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath.	83.57866797294733
First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff.	213.13971370857496
Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths.	99.65527594061535
Who is that beside them?	175.15989589504744
Ah, the brother - in - law.	159.53367541731805
All walked after.	109.20310675597618
Martin Cunningham whispered: — I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.	109.20810796943432
— What?	1096.145065448642
Mr Power whispered.	99.264177876623
How so?	320.9612172372932
— His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered.	183.8358321250195
Had the Queen ’ s hotel in Ennis.	68.7811712530381
You heard him say he was going to Clare.	304.72805524667035
Anniversary.	1218.4197832253003
— O God! Mr Power whispered.	256.18652989723165
First I heard of it.	135.03922784140397
Poisoned himself?	275.29382542023205
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal ’ s mausoleum.	115.06157962470235
Speaking.	724.3403374961829
— Was he insured?	252.62925287457702
Mr Bloom asked.	160.51135127088145
— I believe so, Mr Kernan answered.	549.6518709096996
But the policy was heavily mortgaged.	52.60201643081167
Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.	60.22313407555775
— How many children did he leave?	114.71054095144696
— Five.	3933.1036573861734
— A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently.	241.06470633455706
Five young children.	69.80564442738013
— A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.	105.88337089028758
— Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.	2191.2750668966614
Has the laugh at him now.	58.19340223180196
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished.	201.026360861309
She had outlived him.	147.47009222303453
Lost her husband.	152.15002434637935
More dead for her than for me.	102.50501759063283
One must outlive the other.	47.59641318283211
Wise men say.	82.54364171518819
There are more women than men in the world.	99.82023785506772
Condole with her.	208.86643743490887
Your terrible loss.	81.18180479502695
I hope you ’ ll soon follow him.	193.8652165318457
For Hindu widows only.	60.958303354111614
She would marry another.	127.11254729351106
Him?	724.3403374961829
No. Yet who knows after.	71.85411092356257
Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died.	60.393953553667494
Drawn on a guncarriage.	142.33215539395235
Victoria and Albert.	112.77067707425105
Frogmore memorial mourning.	112.77067707425105
But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet.	200.17002980530603
Vain in her heart of hearts.	68.15076638737735
All for a shadow.	479.1774699169582
Consort not even a king.	78.5467864402253
Her son was the substance.	91.1380768820659
Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting.	73.40215914473343
It never comes.	75.78827166271186
— How are you, Simon?	1131.8098417780088
Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands.	210.37496233590883
Haven ’ t seen you for a month of Sundays.	72.91748848305937
— Never better.	613.9058202816914
How are all in Cork ’ s own town?	192.60669864002682
— I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said.	148.48103731093389
Same old six and eightpence.	198.1528603186941
Stopped with Dick Tivy.	9.421263928511774
— And how is Dick, the solid man?	343.9372944691282
— Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.	127.8414368194488
— By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder.	148.3845641738551
Dick Tivy bald?	101.55103292581168
— Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead.	336.50459952699424
A few bob a skull.	69.70379669637074
Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.	20.389694260105202
— Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously.	624.6041279718145
Is that the eldest boy in front?	505.4392467813323
— Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife ’ s brother.	530.7900415428387
John Henry Menton is behind.	45.17891205386698
He put down his name for a quid.	645.1771114142263
— I ’ ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said.	260.53818009298175
I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job.	41.385992772330475
John Henry is not the worst in the world.	176.06177932194637
— How did he lose it?	179.2931930801345
Ned Lambert asked.	308.59016177481374
Liquor, what?	132.7111388971875
— Many a good man ’ s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.	292.05748666297757
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel.	841.3380016095059
Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar.	43.82941898666597
Poor boy! Was he there when the father?	50.463258369146786
Both unconscious.	129.51980790444875
Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time.	53.63967352813496
All he might have done.	135.68045471253794
I owe three shillings to O ’ Grady.	214.77685429275468
Would he understand?	87.62921706808577
The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel.	202.24160181985525
Which end is his head?	104.21330174845824
After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.	65.7070584448809
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners.	20.787030508935683
Always in front of us.	70.81590961008533
Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel.	43.43924216820905
The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks.	30.51054255453282
Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it.	20.241338027948647
He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.	36.6802897734051
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door.	50.609629183052064
Who ’ ll read the book?	464.26702263215077
I, said the rook.	52.383531667666496
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.	166.95668723905874
Father Coffey.	315.1030066372743
I knew his name was like a coffin.	583.7218277575578
<URL> Bully about the muzzle he looks.	127.24609789786983
Bosses the show.	113.7519241812023
Muscular christian.	275.29382542023205
Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest.	30.023573669828846
Thou art Peter.	79.31747223513555
Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will.	72.02882581329598
With a belly on him like a poisoned pup.	161.79805740927372
Most amusing expressions that man finds.	31.987938351470458
Hhhn: burst sideways.	62.200804154614865
_ — Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, <URL> Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin.	17.817386937087697
Requiem mass.	275.29382542023205
Crape weepers.	275.29382542023205
Blackedged notepaper.	275.29382542023205
Your name on the altarlist.	235.45807291017928
Chilly place this.	112.77067707425105
Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please.	109.1573723002013
Eyes of a toad too.	71.99347033800096
What swells him up that way?	172.7955200838321
Molly gets swelled after cabbage.	36.79743347591933
Air of the place maybe.	489.49489710512125
Looks full up of bad gas.	30.975336544494745
Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place.	50.49254486664727
Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks.	65.36419746045463
Who was telling me?	26.995800937314414
Mervyn Browne.	275.29382542023205
Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh ’ s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it.	32.84082685959196
Out it rushes: blue.	40.70883775622858
One whiff of that and you ’ re a goner.	140.65861653645567
My kneecap is hurting me.	32.29321951590208
Ow. That ’ s better.	169.92454437940606
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy ’ s bucket and shook it over the coffin.	106.3125868104858
Then he walked to the other end and shook it again.	90.73252402176651
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket.	190.9751945726582
As you were before you rested.	74.27145788665915
It ’ s all written down: he has to do it.	41.089362635372275
_ — Et ne nos inducas in <URL> The server piped the answers in the treble.	21.27880668885341
I often thought it would be better to have boy servants.	111.80653977001658
Up to fifteen or so.	40.597968931248886
After that, of course...	192.73062454869665
Holy water that was, I expect.	322.1874692478439
Shaking sleep out of it.	170.23491234479243
He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.	71.75777959961923
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over.	177.00718052535515
Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows ’ breasts.	9.04480549872041
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep.	105.63178487692718
On Dignam now.	471.311539425819
_ — In <URL> Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise.	84.88525356993792
Says that over everybody.	56.1838370774367
Tiresome kind of a job.	90.6892843255802
But he has to say something.	379.6067796006515
The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.	72.85423411376658
Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart.	65.11454797973185
Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother - in - law.	40.35487099700551
All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air.	136.5293609455972
Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket.	27.000859813615072
He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left.	205.75277412074834
The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.	21.793266243747187
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo.	28.814035496159207
Lord, I mustn ’ t lilt here.	270.4824834190917
— The O ’ Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.	179.94716460253338
Mr Power ’ s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.	118.30018307205091
— He ’ s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O ’.	659.6880510333705
But his heart is buried in Rome.	74.90930186626419
How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon! — Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said.	27.246554760561065
I ’ ll soon be stretched beside her.	94.30768773124653
Let Him take me whenever He likes.	74.30321189731515
Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk.	43.528138303095716
Mr Power took his arm.	85.3499060219152
— She ’ s better where she is, he said kindly.	236.11958390516685
— I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp.	664.968345936221
I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven.	328.14274234370095
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.	16.39032762758597
— Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.	67.0995846753513
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.	65.26746703075176
— The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said.	41.46779471124513
I suppose we can do so too.	245.25071637610705
We are the last.	171.47531685574552
This cemetery is a treacherous place.	53.02844204252654
They covered their heads.	192.6055946360997
— The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don ’ t you think?	67.243097420115
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes.	130.11155971111302
Mason, I think: not sure.	162.6826699303043
Beside him again.	10.69365381215927
We are the last.	171.47531685574552
In the same boat.	1101.8499036238532
Hope he ’ ll say something else.	77.99112541402677
Mr Kernan added: — The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say.	23.136194689204718
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent.	147.9077279469708
The language of course was another thing.	369.6443461386281
Mr Kernan said with solemnity: — _I am the resurrection and the life_.	89.7362028661625
That touches a man ’ s inmost heart.	108.47766515751792
— It does, Mr Bloom said.	510.98153946217116
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies?	42.79787166424868
No touching that.	401.53661708021815
Seat of the affections.	884.9186030822211
Broken heart.	203.25405355927603
A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day.	30.810075603637795
One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are.	51.987795746749796
Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers.	17.777657452473676
Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else.	19.300075018090606
The resurrection and the life.	1181.0200471363914
Once you are dead you are dead.	266.3965668463084
That last day idea.	81.16154390690897
Knocking them all up out of their graves.	66.57466054377919
Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job.	35.07543896554141
Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps.	31.05310694098894
Find damn all of himself that morning.	115.78634768579616
Pennyweight of powder in a skull.	71.70956985946628
Twelve grammes one pennyweight.	47.95886141701586
Troy measure.	275.29382542023205
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.	23.830029407783584
— Everything went off A<NUM>, he said.	263.61968825960173
What?	1560.489681896445
He looked on them from his drawling eye.	104.7286649013771
Policeman ’ s shoulders.	410.5183207124456
With your tooraloom tooraloom.	227.80462538388986
— As it should be, Mr Kernan said.	60.835544328991
— What?	1096.145065448642
Corny Kelleher said.	49.44484474933874
Mr Kernan assured him.	49.24921484098877
John Henry Menton asked.	70.23341132764843
I know his face.	171.295572995792
Ned Lambert glanced back.	916.8947238629848
— Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.	785.4108666444756
She ’ s his wife.	374.0281902823347
— O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said.	73.36919120746313
I haven ’ t seen her for some time.	47.40613906948058
She was a finelooking woman.	143.45211027468875
I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon ’ s in Roundtown.	45.510318968035044
And a good armful she was.	268.4985758830076
He looked behind through the others.	342.9857885398294
— What is he?	913.2233406889569
he asked.	72.62503664047722
What does he do?	37.76572560399011
Wasn ’ t he in the stationery line?	320.38881567228117
I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.	145.17719118857224
Ned Lambert smiled.	567.9112644381124
A traveller for blottingpaper.	170.16527229446356
— In God ’ s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for?	144.69234929920643
She had plenty of game in her then.	75.8009772749735
— Has still, Ned Lambert said.	238.9640138177088
He does some canvassing for ads.	68.34469820876645
John Henry Menton ’ s large eyes stared ahead.	63.48668591617601
The barrow turned into a side lane.	109.7857154203143
A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage.	64.1528005699303
The gravediggers touched their caps.	100.96444631460727
— John O ’ Connell, Mr Power said pleased.	267.99896103376864
He never forgets a friend.	128.03637601235596
Mr O ’ Connell shook all their hands in silence.	51.01857133250724
Mr Dedalus said: — I am come to pay you another visit.	111.84684259566743
— My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice.	233.06463804221184
I don ’ t want your custom at all.	75.45960757150473
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham ’ s side puzzling two long keys at his back.	100.866900884615
— Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?	138.16781255658472
— I did not, Martin Cunningham said.	336.2837128662747
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear.	21.241713125562768
The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.	51.61471741509707
— They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs.	141.36173527976834
They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried.	65.36901714370286
After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough.	57.35363936206112
One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy.	112.94781156357007
The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.	28.056336827243143
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed.	167.47149571291774
He resumed: — And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like the man_, says he.	80.74875278511722
_That ’ s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.	49.78053724073677
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.	22.68323344122332
— That ’ s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.	137.19645300191482
— I know, Hynes said.	246.76517884527772
I know that.	397.99710911681933
— To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said.	96.1476432299941
It ’ s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.	38.35909545520417
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker ’ s prosperous bulk.	151.70540914337465
All want to be on good terms with him.	36.329709934751435
Decent fellow, John O ’ Connell, real good sort.	45.13159180268154
Keys: like Keyes ’ s ad: no fear of anyone getting out.	57.81539757349065
No passout checks.	400.9555695172086
_Habeas corpus_.	275.29382542023205
I must see about that ad after the funeral.	61.21905562806316
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha?	30.759766408421257
Hope it ’ s not chucked in the dead letter office.	121.87804605358158
Be the better of a shave.	80.57392663425568
Grey sprouting beard.	82.54364171518819
That ’ s the first sign when the hairs come out grey.	101.0090423874517
And temper getting cross.	175.18220446728057
Silver threads among the grey.	83.41157546958392
Fancy being his wife.	68.85207732135797
Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl.	54.84607879997292
Come out and live in the graveyard.	250.86939494635746
Dangle that before her.	93.908203456743
It might thrill her first.	40.50057835844762
Courting death.	275.53574191717297
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about.	73.13793985672913
The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O ’ Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark.	89.36235881730524
Will o ’ the wisp.	98.27038492141881
Gas of graves.	88.40530891686868
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all.	54.70153866071468
Women especially are so touchy.	35.32213165748729
Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep.	65.77339022388837
Have you ever seen a ghost?	75.5929623188905
Well, I have.	723.3817650385931
It was a pitchdark night.	137.4933522704628
The clock was on the stroke of twelve.	138.28536250175716
Still they ’ d kiss all right if properly keyed up.	36.403552296379004
Learn anything if taken young.	35.06101014322758
You might pick up a young widow here.	78.79721591152624
Men like that.	50.80057444414064
Love among the tombstones.	89.4934539003653
Romeo.	1218.4197832253003
Spice of pleasure.	118.77434066426113
In the midst of death we are in life.	60.550715129211504
Both ends meet.	61.691874253470225
Tantalising for the poor dead.	587.3704097899749
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving.	89.08848417880496
Gnawing their vitals.	112.77067707425105
Desire to grig people.	50.78059647831953
Molly wanting to do it at the window.	230.02907275541978
Eight children he has anyway.	314.54250050791694
He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field.	31.6317255951283
Holy fields.	203.07158957055697
More room if they buried them standing.	28.360832888640655
Sitting or kneeling you couldn ’ t.	20.09736778823465
Standing?	812.0832237234374
His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing.	23.067149425780112
And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings.	27.439560374940335
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome.	54.06933808154796
Well, so it is.	537.4731244522808
Ought to be flowers of sleep.	47.95686734736758
Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me.	12.982886596487958
The Botanic Gardens are just over there.	55.967928693044804
It ’ s the blood sinking in the earth gives new life.	94.64243054068163
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.	18.068092641830866
Every man his price.	43.1453909368973
Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden.	12.626485554079284
A bargain.	1047.493585384237
By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six.	11.38366167936137
With thanks.	1593.8067344417275
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails.	21.210354614824915
Charnelhouses.	1218.4197832253003
Dreadful.	724.3403374961829
Turning green and pink decomposing.	9.193572351826363
Rot quick in damp earth.	44.898178407770196
The lean old ones tougher.	129.29233085289758
Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy.	72.15427145827155
Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them.	98.99583312741628
Then dried up.	448.86066388906545
Deathmoths.	1218.4197832253003
Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living.	23.245873804371946
Changing about.	203.25405355927603
Live for ever practically.	451.6954171697159
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.	25.566458819938696
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots.	44.8790024615919
Soil must be simply swirling with them.	56.00023191966631
Your head it simply swurls.	25.00959827899679
Those pretty little seaside gurls.	34.555779189236105
He looks cheerful enough over it.	66.34113106463847
Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first.	55.131604643523524
Wonder how he looks at life.	48.02561130497346
Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart.	37.00549810769996
The one about the bulletin.	672.6773722110953
Spurgeon went to heaven <NUM> <URL>. this morning.	59.47262826934063
<NUM> <URL>. (closing time).	104.46159359497011
Not arrived yet.	101.06839737415997
Peter.	22.186048183429246
The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what ’ s in fashion.	95.87731607167395
A juicy pear or ladies ’ punch, hot, strong and sweet.	21.816955822959983
Keep out the damp.	88.46070486600077
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.	17.632926282268272
Gravediggers in _Hamlet_.	101.55103292581168
Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart.	72.19049426337128
Daren ’ t joke about the dead for two years at least.	238.07650560876533
_De mortuis nil nisi prius_.	40.66534266626026
Go out of mourning first.	111.96200336410925
Hard to imagine his funeral.	33.57340254077024
Seems a sort of a joke.	169.26601304452583
Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer.	52.52234110871245
Gives you second wind.	50.78059647831953
New lease of life.	36.826604929400006
— How many have you for tomorrow?	156.54416833636486
the caretaker asked.	105.1305831132283
— Two, Corny Kelleher said.	83.01173349275771
Half ten and eleven.	55.70728810191848
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket.	146.81588137475586
The barrow had ceased to trundle.	71.08395044109328
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves.	70.02268972914811
The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.	27.768825009311318
Burying him.	210.71174056842062
We come to bury Cæsar.	250.6410287184742
His ides of March or June.	70.66702412145057
He doesn ’ t know who is here nor care.	99.16785844949781
Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh?	134.8535273716452
Now who is he I ’ d like to know?	170.35092682140024
Now I ’ d give a trifle to know who he is.	72.53432409881619
Always someone turns up you never dreamt of.	25.736246750818335
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life.	86.07031411880193
Yes, he could.	4760.391852074509
Still he ’ d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave.	49.921197319554416
We all do.	581.010659505095
Only man buries.	77.39931858800006
No, ants too.	639.4152989597598
First thing strikes anybody.	45.470002615837984
Bury the dead.	90.44153381793855
Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life.	25.601154791397096
Well then Friday buried him.	44.89374578576143
Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.	39.61787289409609
O, poor Robinson Crusoe! How could you possibly do so?	48.16501854419737
Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box.	92.16570837870631
When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood.	40.32992713362798
All gnawed through.	109.20310675597618
They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way.	38.66931292350431
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow ’ s.	77.06800332312916
They ’ re so particular.	168.0766946832383
Lay me in my native earth.	58.54514308823894
Bit of clay from the holy land.	18.85151436614572
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin.	34.801272551721965
I see what it means.	716.8936786503215
I see.	431.75195169869767
To protect him as long as possible even in the earth.	98.99445861552152
The Irishman ’ s house is his coffin.	208.71415327419334
Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea.	73.93843643731358
Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.	121.18089010838486
Twelve.	724.3403374961829
I ’ m thirteen.	224.40083206289455
No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.	84.69402039307342
Death ’ s number.	127.76887673591462
Where the deuce did he pop out of?	130.06714197185417
He wasn ’ t in the chapel, that I ’ ll swear.	442.51182138151444
Silly superstition that about thirteen.	34.554056084420594
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit.	82.83059290678688
Tinge of purple.	129.53949124709393
I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west.	107.08828930725885
Dressy fellow he was once.	358.9326420635092
Used to change three suits in the day.	71.43032143579053
Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias.	17.098219496809484
Hello.	198.81596679899442
It ’ s dyed.	317.42468549180893
His wife I forgot he ’ s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.	33.721576426151145
The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles.	94.86809216145872
They struggled up and out: and all uncovered.	240.34502583758353
Twenty.	476.3337975065675
Pause.	1218.4197832253003
If we were all suddenly somebody else.	136.51085180890553
Far away a donkey brayed.	158.96270310120335
Rain.	525.8816296405445
No such ass.	400.9555695172086
Never see a dead one, they say.	82.87102129598689
Shame of death.	93.00059778209523
They hide.	1291.9706265316322
Also poor papa went away.	61.106620666185755
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper.	80.44336424798931
Whisper.	440.858884305153
The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space.	59.459530338695224
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.	51.82701275180152
Wellcut frockcoat.	275.29382542023205
Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.	70.38752679074418
Well, it is a long rest.	94.27442382110553
Feel no more.	358.7123779959306
It ’ s the moment you feel.	107.169694344553
Must be damned unpleasant.	88.54078393565304
Can ’ t believe it at first.	147.2009136090919
Mistake must be: someone else.	41.12130469665832
Try the house opposite.	469.7436148428916
Wait, I wanted to.	305.6459438761974
I haven ’ t yet.	728.9339562178545
Then darkened deathchamber.	421.99297081870503
Light they want.	93.33101291285776
Whispering around you.	86.93401339123609
Would you like to see a priest?	284.658217782718
Then rambling and wandering.	186.8042948448233
Delirium all you hid all your life.	34.953450212810395
His sleep is not natural.	186.62961838213582
Press his lower eyelid.	69.81804203787918
Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow.	76.9169930270255
Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he ’ s doomed.	71.32901651133244
Devil in that picture of sinner ’ s death showing him a woman.	27.16155934474316
Dying to embrace her in his shirt.	151.03288207688928
Shall I nevermore behold thee_?	32.540914122043546
Bam! He expires.	161.72051499041075
Gone at last.	181.7478678487781
People talk about you a bit: forget you.	68.6426927927926
Don ’ t forget to pray for him.	93.1974038000871
Remember him in your prayers.	1435.6611814379621
Even Parnell.	168.55004189637677
Ivy day dying out.	207.90694618125474
Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.	84.98954800923002
We are praying now for the repose of his soul.	362.24162368964414
Hoping you ’ re well and not in hell.	110.35074148829206
Nice change of air.	108.54114506140563
Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.	203.98231963948407
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself?	84.17343365172697
They say you do when you shiver in the sun.	238.23439056491625
Someone walking over it.	32.7528088664549
Near you.	151.97903238527743
Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought.	31.920278857913974
Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.	172.20688565142544
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin.	49.906795348106904
Mr Bloom turned away his face.	80.26284973985253
And if he was alive all the time?	353.2495555099828
Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course.	85.69963789528495
Of course he is dead.	72.21075612535303
Monday he died.	130.46618224199025
They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole.	29.358796289628327
Flag of distress.	112.77067707425105
Three days.	236.64838168034143
Rather long to keep them in summer.	35.678958300413484
Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there ’ s no.	138.92839355278858
The clay fell softer.	190.338094691918
Begin to be forgotten.	154.0622086486111
Out of sight, out of mind.	61.752367631428484
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat.	171.0714201067841
Had enough of it.	211.53108412631832
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show.	20.212312042978237
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves.	77.13108968866209
Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.	127.44036980634243
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook.	110.86256855172496
Ah, the names.	2128.0609330402367
But he knows them all.	104.64343227010092
No: coming to me.	127.53757422112466
— I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath.	56.507163543247124
What is your christian name?	309.49521004668264
I ’ m not sure.	96.59861125261409
Leopold.	499.8617600090092
He asked me to.	170.7055742386712
— Charley, Hynes said writing.	194.46486357308956
I know.	422.21812241641607
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.	118.49089024000445
Good idea a postmortem for doctors.	22.151289336290997
Find out what they imagine they know.	123.47458654249581
He died of a Tuesday.	319.3746113808734
Got the run.	86.7330427666353
Levanted with the cash of a few ads.	95.19220645873135
Charley, you ’ re my darling.	129.88604305587714
That was why he asked me to.	124.5972178088447
O well, does no harm.	98.00421049639219
I saw to that, M ’ Coy.	474.5916255709473
Thanks, old chap: much obliged.	25.32376493911042
Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.	20.042496966761387
— And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the...	145.11192826961837
He looked around.	299.2640138705042
— Macintosh.	3933.1036573861734
Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said.	574.6076915336942
Where is he now?	176.68298912935032
— M ’ Intosh, Hynes said scribbling.	157.2693910746574
I don ’ t know who he is.	93.69622152528102
Is that his name?	1502.6409842308722
He moved away, looking about him.	35.360136399781474
— No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping.	287.00943127626783
I say, Hynes! Didn ’ t hear.	129.85234630119635
What?	1560.489681896445
Where has he disappeared to?	136.67778760255993
Not a sign.	76.86941144479147
Well of all the.	2817.4686506803682
Has anybody here seen?	37.62399560610032
Kay ee double ell.	50.78059647831953
Become invisible.	275.29382542023205
Good Lord, what became of him?	93.16070754683736
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.	49.3989780938812
— O, excuse me! He stepped aside nimbly.	101.71799674933531
Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole.	67.29173713306268
It rose.	264.5318366141609
Nearly over.	203.07158957055697
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades.	115.63959649028898
All uncovered again for a few instants.	39.748435204125585
The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother - in - law his on a lump.	20.75548690702249
The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow.	55.95096217885958
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean.	85.25640533138065
One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass.	28.89856163985403
One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.	14.817344509499161
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.	78.30646176567303
His navelcord.	1322.4554482011363
The brother - in - law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.	57.915009320681776
Thanks in silence.	87.62402049316533
Sorry, sir: trouble.	232.56855285704125
Headshake.	1218.4197832253003
I know that.	397.99710911681933
For yourselves just.	110.07290633065016
The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.	14.072518889359507
— Let us go round by the chief ’ s grave, Hynes said.	147.11358498569857
— Let us, Mr Power said.	207.36875580301063
They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts.	88.17090711697595
With awe Mr Power ’ s blank voice spoke: — Some say he is not in that grave at all.	89.92697638151276
That the coffin was filled with stones.	34.43873527479237
That one day he will come again.	43.222139973599205
Hynes shook his head.	64.84237762994623
— Parnell will never come again, he said.	755.9125979898678
He ’ s there, all that was mortal of him.	257.8928002064442
Peace to his ashes.	124.23866908879575
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland ’ s hearts and hands.	14.46068806328438
More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living.	40.145105261496184
Pray for the repose of the soul of.	216.25057356726094
Does anybody really?	58.38277309611692
Plant him and have done with him.	172.3211680573401
Like down a coalshoot.	89.15206075390302
Then lump them together to save time.	72.96473363896189
All souls ’ day.	60.58051772064311
Twentyseventh I ’ ll be at his grave.	162.92221105028858
Ten shillings for the gardener.	224.89425736897118
He keeps it free of weeds.	85.88492364019964
Old man himself.	83.98526045845766
Bent down double with his shears clipping.	43.122852620677556
Near death ’ s door.	226.38382802105764
Who passed away.	469.5309593673107
Who departed this life.	211.7725939997489
As if they did it of their own accord.	46.957106843676605
Got the shove, all of them.	65.11292115927489
Who kicked the bucket.	205.2330353624195
So and So, wheelwright.	154.77683740490812
I travelled for cork lino.	118.80524221464692
I paid five shillings in the pound.	401.76408689557775
Or a woman ’ s with her saucepan.	94.95527562898378
I cooked good Irish stew.	112.1191276169293
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.	23.321905572867962
Entered into rest the protestants put it.	47.98791732704205
Old Dr Murren ’ s.	135.82362985617155
The great physician called him home.	103.5686543550036
Well it ’ s God ’ s acre for them.	212.3110121162008
Nice country residence.	82.15532221685555
Newly plastered and painted.	62.200804154614865
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the _Church <URL> Marriage ads they never try to beautify.	23.640125413867302
Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil.	17.778597724543165
Better value that for the money.	198.17761009131175
Still, the flowers are more poetical.	117.10220027175444
The other gets rather tiresome, never withering.	32.2666706180277
Expresses nothing.	275.29382542023205
Immortelles.	1218.4197832253003
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch.	49.491010085390634
Like stuffed.	290.4190102864384
Hoo! Not a budge out of him.	36.07225795305457
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him.	17.68236626236123
Dead animal even sadder.	35.82953144972298
Silly - Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.	31.114959438366142
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it.	172.90582106054748
Heart on his sleeve.	596.5911187872281
Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart.	38.65933544061603
Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that.	104.29694165075867
Seems anything but pleased.	57.1629342479482
Why this infliction?	516.1070540063114
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy.	48.57338148608337
Apollo that was.	569.6651627728963
How many! All these here once walked round Dublin.	19.105570774246694
Besides how could you remember everybody?	52.09086163608906
Eyes, walk, voice.	42.83395228204341
Well, the voice, yes: gramophone.	442.0141118138234
Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house.	87.54489184354952
Put on poor old greatgrandfather.	35.719825468812296
Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth.	16.088770021395945
Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face.	190.92057727022942
Otherwise you couldn ’ t remember the face after fifteen years, say.	40.102630274142214
For instance who?	60.65397886592423
For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	48.191548624113025
Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles.	51.52116291185701
Wait.	199.9002065950114
Stop! He looked down intently into a stone crypt.	45.754685075539996
Some animal.	148.0767188762466
Wait.	199.9002065950114
There he goes.	84.8185627338434
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles.	87.28820139619542
An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes.	17.085611137037947
The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.	21.802856617860257
Good hidingplace for treasure.	48.68309379121877
Who lives there?	468.3126872931216
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery.	36.345917516340414
Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn ’ t he?	27.86530529103191
Making his rounds.	89.8799497826024
Tail gone now.	129.53949124709393
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow.	25.140523025544095
Pick the bones clean no matter who it was.	28.450511331396033
Ordinary meat for them.	63.57126673862039
A corpse is meat gone bad.	49.533562430465174
Well and what ’ s cheese?	249.8784470002088
Corpse of milk.	130.1751925421424
I read in that _Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse.	79.65073055457265
Cremation better.	275.29382542023205
Priests dead against it.	62.23770187605233
Devilling for the other firm.	594.1313364831753
Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers.	32.24218854309747
Time of the plague.	487.8218242398343
Quicklime feverpits to eat them.	63.4483610733086
Lethal chamber.	275.29382542023205
Ashes to ashes.	88.40533026634156
Or bury at sea.	304.0720333814499
Where is that Parsee tower of silence?	202.13247383401358
Eaten by birds.	88.40530891686868
Earth, fire, water.	54.64519413843459
Drowning they say is the pleasantest.	217.82715657738103
See your whole life in a flash.	183.05815863502616
But being brought back to life no.	88.62641447621543
Can ’ t bury in the air however.	290.9489558993785
Out of a flying machine.	89.88451834256426
Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down.	20.045290926476984
Underground communication.	275.29382542023205
We learned that from them.	198.67843264454135
Wouldn ’ t be surprised.	119.04669651801586
Regular square feed for them.	34.819652637782404
Got wind of Dignam.	101.01573471097272
They wouldn ’ t care about the smell of it.	517.976640646171
Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.	11.448082927632104
The gates glimmered in front: still open.	57.44694326318056
Back to the world again.	304.0085414483099
Enough of this place.	16.156610729845937
Brings you a bit nearer every time.	115.01986544227461
Poor papa too.	69.06254779189747
The love that kills.	228.5840518933138
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores.	46.58579769526203
Give you the creeps after a bit.	265.1069176513758
I will appear to you after death.	657.8493877435221
You will see my ghost after death.	42.18763022104791
My ghost will haunt you after death.	20.070668712044938
There is another world after death named hell.	105.96218950854771
I do not like that other world she wrote.	104.5225932290529
No more do I.	153.38299879476247
Plenty to see and hear and feel yet.	88.32860891318116
Feel live warm beings near you.	23.00836713309259
Let them sleep in their maggoty beds.	29.271211669072734
They are not going to get me this innings.	214.77758228013164
Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.	26.529505912596036
Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.	63.51168819423379
Solicitor, I think.	329.37379869368215
I know his face.	171.295572995792
Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits.	22.893952814596283
Dignam used to be in his office.	472.5786319089477
Convivial evenings.	275.29382542023205
Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses.	61.78072805364456
Heart of gold really.	58.543020271954774
Yes, Menton.	567.5135831407184
Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him.	30.786946495302516
Pure fluke of mine: the bias.	48.61451326586141
Why he took such a rooted dislike to me.	69.23196912247002
Hate at first sight.	77.59159038573013
Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing.	20.683635448398185
Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.	20.34818606754936
Got a dinge in the side of his hat.	1679.9253159159882
Carriage probably.	275.5761468538871
— Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.	690.927956533293
They stopped.	1291.9706265316322
— Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.	163.67200422701316
John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.	65.6525731804296
— There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.	387.61861662981113
John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve.	22.16393724107738
He clapped the hat on his head again.	172.36391730990204
— It ’ s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.	187.22093792562538
John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.	111.41946574162975
— Thank you, he said shortly.	1178.1650624564575
They walked on towards the gates.	212.0707051857215
Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear.	31.743020672164505
Martin laying down the law.	427.9024597960094
Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.	35.44344461930063
Oyster eyes.	307.10908831989474
Never mind.	2640.3871132918507
Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.	24.687880503618363
Get the pull over him that way.	25.998473134245177
Thank you.	83.27464327019725
How grand we are this morning! IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS Before Nelson ’ s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure, Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold ’ s Cross.	8.519707561233494
The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company ’ s timekeeper bawled them off: — Rathgar and Terenure! — Come on, Sandymount Green! Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.	22.13768775852508
— Start, Palmerston Park! THE WEARER OF THE CROWN Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and polished.	40.68797813858062
R., received loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.	12.984762933700189
GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince ’ s stores and bumped them up on the brewery float.	44.96703097933066
On the brewery float bumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince ’ s stores.	34.51963102746728
— There it is, Red Murray said.	611.2084404315563
Alexander Keyes.	231.76340101684016
— Just cut it out, will you?	236.86780051802276
Mr Bloom said, and I ’ ll take it round to the _Telegraph_ office.	214.3719205563992
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office creaked again.	102.98005477395724
Davy Stephens, minute in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a roll of papers under his cape, a king ’ s courier.	26.183039038142013
Red Murray ’ s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes.	33.27270186118454
Scissors and paste.	112.77067707425105
— I ’ ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square.	207.61142070769154
— Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind his ear, we can do him one.	67.46787873630807
— Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod.	324.401585527541
I ’ ll rub that in.	358.9909144367743
We. WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT Red Murray touched Mr Bloom ’ s arm with the shears and whispered: — Brayden.	25.6871685295341
Dullthudding Guinness ’ s barrels.	419.5514366287634
It passed statelily up the staircase, steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face.	19.433968566077837
The broadcloth back ascended each step: back.	82.89062044772807
All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalus says.	113.29225035377303
Welts of flesh behind on him.	40.45837325687485
Fat folds of neck, fat, neck, fat, neck.	16.960125400418168
— Don ’ t you think his face is like Our Saviour?	123.68279115359562
Red Murray whispered.	73.76461883857314
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office whispered: ee: cree.	57.796083690148215
They always build one door opposite another for the wind to.	177.46291171346743
Way in.	258.43897746898995
Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk.	44.90322173785394
Mary, Martha.	131.98626001088888
Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.	39.19688209398691
— Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.	234.63210747075485
— Yes, Red Murray agreed.	195.76211030715743
But Mario was said to be the picture of Our Saviour.	104.18507738693077
Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs.	19.51336597075366

In <URL> Co - ome thou lost one, Co - ome thou dear one! THE CROZIER AND THE PEN — His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.	21.892180018214834
They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish.	48.827998398662906
A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word: _ — Freeman! _ Mr Bloom said slowly: — Well, he is one of our saviours also.	86.91695837028243
A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now reverberating boards.	18.827512952364685
But will he save the circulation?	123.50005152260587
Thumping.	502.22953946992163
Thumping.	502.22953946992163
He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper.	41.593205063758376
Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti ’ s reading closet.	52.735360309082

Like these, got out of hand: fermenting.	56.27620828320812
Working away, tearing away.	49.05829335369713
And that old grey rat tearing to get in.	34.89242744630131
HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman ’ s spare body, admiring a glossy crown.	29.048007372850186
Strange he never saw his real country.	36.9365573574667

Now if he got paralysed there and no - one knew how to stop them they ’ d clank on and on the same, print it over and over and up and back.	67.56018099903145

— Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.	126.46180064382507
Soon be calling him my lord mayor.	38.251522074823114
Long John is backing him, they say.	137.8915019661118
The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter.	41.29734094343062
He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.	52.54907960680618
— Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.	50.759376317724445
Mr Bloom stood in his way.	81.12988757527363
— If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb.	114.8370503273192
— Did you?	758.1336204040115
— Mm, Mr Bloom said.	698.182617271097
Look sharp and you ’ ll catch him.	139.78248784122803
— Thanks, old man, Hynes said.	83.34774081699565
I ’ ll tap him too.	214.17297766839496
He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman ’ s Journal_.	128.92247921641678
Three bob I lent him in Meagher ’ s.	130.34778967195166
Three weeks.	179.81388535242195
Third hint.	203.07158957055697
WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti ’ s desk.	45.351587223773606
— Excuse me, councillor, he said.	834.0627718004632
Keyes, you remember?	132.81056668686668
Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.	23.84161270654287
— He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.	587.6493584846027
The foreman moved his pencil towards it.	12.59791756343944
— But wait, Mr Bloom said.	360.3849657111951
He wants it changed.	27.77854093075542
Keyes, you see.	57.77323671515816
He wants two keys at the top.	26.966301567221496
Hell of a racket they make.	48.346594424016686
He doesn ’ t hear it.	207.65481739393076
Nannan.	1218.4197832253003
Iron nerves.	186.38277244620522
Maybe he understands what I.	234.1424380098988
The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.	58.91328398278584
— Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.	178.80346741832554
Let him take that in first.	227.20518110762686
Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman ’ s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.	44.55958787712299
Clank it.	170.91413926326024
Clank it.	170.91413926326024
Miles of it unreeled.	492.20428194512584
What becomes of it after?	792.3607711021327
O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.	19.47084360843027
Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.	92.52084832583445
HOUSE OF KEY (E) S — Like that, see.	25.68285000702237
Two crossed keys here.	47.57514133610896
A circle.	1047.493585384237
Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant.	25.736174553550832
So on.	1005.78871133997
Better not teach him his own business.	31.66878371001203
— You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants.	162.9892364677692
Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys.	305.14736794800456
You see?	91.29454353320843
Do you think that ’ s a good idea?	128.32283978304704
The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.	11.536667512469464
— The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys.	221.14431257576445
You know, councillor, the Manx parliament.	220.2069964564471
Innuendo of home rule.	78.36810247478773
Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man.	38.353949280478275
Catches the eye, you see.	81.43667368656806
Can you do that?	595.2919574279317
I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <URL> But then if he didn ’ t know only make it awkward for him.	30.161763022846475
Better not.	115.47224163816541
— We can do that, the foreman said.	188.58240970615066
Have you the design?	295.87917166927434
— I can get it, Mr Bloom said.	777.5647065827916
It was in a Kilkenny paper.	115.76059689683161
He has a house there too.	95.5349866928905
I ’ ll just run out and ask him.	101.3907193721579
Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention.	68.46105541181456
Longfelt want.	278.2913294079874
So on.	1005.78871133997
The foreman thought for an instant.	18.485440680878575
— We can do that, he said.	171.8957123121605
Let him give us a three months ’ renewal.	50.447080206305294
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage.	79.6482479264836
He began to check it silently.	20.68095279837744
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.	20.527905374400977

Cemetery put in of course on account of the symmetry.	260.8890953209072
I should have said when he clapped on his topper.	182.58050560382645
Thank you.	83.27464327019725
I ought to have said something about an old hat or something.	91.18322998991151
No. I could have said.	122.88511269693225

He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.	54.999733940834446
— Monks, sir?	1388.0992385087097
— Ay. Where ’ s Monks?	594.3293005034739
— Monks! Mr Bloom took up his cutting.	217.2167296805174
Time to get out.	6944.405811460404
— Then I ’ ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you ’ ll give it a good place I know.	344.48718742226043

Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs ’ ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned.	15.165478709337284

And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat.	54.89159327107128

Seems to see with his fingers.	137.84070332425514
Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing.	246.13499768556738
Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps.	463.89871410797195
Better phone him up first.	50.8039834125521

Ah, the soap I put there.	504.7637447457199
Lose it out of that pocket.	527.86699890212
Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.	24.066237915156506
What perfume does your wife use?	64.09586622333138

Just to see: before: dressing.	77.02364979263311
No. Here.	284.0594937646069
No. A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.	29.41876748336623
Know who that is.	170.47185963708446
What ’ s up?	496.80197330831146
Ned Lambert it is.	889.3283649973018
He entered softly.	390.8854138042594
ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA — The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane.	22.184684292627445
Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert ’ s quizzing face, asked of it sourly: — Agonising Christ, wouldn ’ t it give you a heartburn on your arse?	50.410016356971056
Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on: — _Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way, tho ’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters of Neptune ’ s blue domain, ’ mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’ neath the shadows cast o ’ er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest_.	34.2221389742219
What about that, Simon?	273.44199545762507
he asked over the fringe of his newspaper.	173.38896792459303
How ’ s that for high?	143.11488686487797
— Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.	170.25217132617644
Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating: — _The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_.	82.53821642009578
O boys! O boys! — And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.	144.08763159734744
— That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window.	269.8464118999978
I don ’ t want to hear any more of the stuff.	406.94403716066984
High falutin stuff.	56.5222700052377
Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.	58.35686082265019
Rather upsets a man ’ s day, a funeral does.	159.1191081899159
He has influence they say.	263.2615717505746
Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle.	69.4334128076588
Close on ninety they say.	108.71106855781699

— Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.	93.0821004828692
— What is it?	608.0440085668911
Mr Bloom asked.	160.51135127088145
— A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered with pomp of tone.	28.717702913899068
_Our lovely land_.	112.77067707425105
SHORT BUT TO THE POINT — Whose land?	21.120672769248195
Mr Bloom said simply.	211.82511265133658
— Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews.	142.5683206303006
With an accent on the whose.	385.0944805122637
— Dan Dawson ’ s land Mr Dedalus said.	185.8852638053454
— Is it his speech last night?	288.71240301771445
Mr Bloom asked.	160.51135127088145
— But listen to this, he said.	277.63706491592177
The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in.	369.4193228325324
— Excuse me, J.	947.8419249232375
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy said, entering.	540.8260633521044
Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.	91.6287398745506
— I beg yours, he said.	1052.2434367217686
— Good day, Jack.	661.9534776608832
— Come in.	739.0988919380638
Come in.	194.2558086488763
— Good day.	976.4798217426388
— How are you, Dedalus?	990.4036394484843
And yourself?	1301.1802186074501
J.	129.7375304578709
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy shook his head.	193.9805445887698
SAD Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be.	92.93888513669795
Decline, poor chap.	74.27279457719128
That hectic flush spells finis for a man.	60.114302113623275
Touch and go with him.	35.46983701577897
What ’ s in the wind, I wonder.	496.24736874140586
Money worry.	13.64610561238065
— _Or again if we but climb the serried mountain <URL> — You ’ re looking extra.	24.850161270376137
— Is the editor to be seen?	280.0261373066448
J.	129.7375304578709
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy asked, looking towards the inner door.	105.74356686790858
— Very much so, professor MacHugh said.	149.9501476188475
To be seen and heard.	156.62779174997266
He ’ s in his sanctum with Lenehan.	351.09554021006187
J.	129.7375304578709
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file.	102.57972253757197
Practice dwindling.	203.07158957055697
A mighthavebeen.	1047.493585384237
Losing heart.	275.5411825693149
Gambling.	1218.4197832253003
Debts of honour.	121.37156452027531
Reaping the whirlwind.	112.77067707425105
Used to get good retainers from D.	104.59518155253129
and T.	100.39477067177603
Fitzgerald.	1218.4197832253003
Their wigs to show the grey matter.	33.13533428055556
Brains on their sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin.	49.63659495445752
Believe he does some literary work for the _Express_ with Gabriel Conroy.	54.97447003989625
Wellread fellow.	275.29382542023205
Myles Crawford began on the <URL> Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening.	54.74366667161587
Weathercocks.	1218.4197832253003
Hot and cold in the same breath.	213.83777354361382
Wouldn ’ t know which to believe.	101.03799058527612
One story good till you hear the next.	48.08622708370717
Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over.	131.03431822955645
Hail fellow well met the next moment.	36.29285021679177
— Ah, listen to this for God ’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded.	132.98957294156557
_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks... _ — Bombast! the professor broke in testily.	16.09463792995868
Enough of the inflated windbag! — _Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our souls, as it were... _ — Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said.	31.515137135137383
Blessed and eternal God! Yes?	48.13918541208825
Is he taking anything for it?	54.06563716193986
_ — As ’ twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland ’ s portfolio, unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight... _ HIS NATIVE DORIC — The moon, professor MacHugh said.	16.90750177085701
He forgot Hamlet.	434.0700385453178
Shite and onions! That ’ ll do, Ned.	151.85430205495143
Life is too short.	52.92243964201755
He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.	32.48974554408018
Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight.	44.12872549356261
An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh ’ s unshaven blackspectacled face.	50.402764225557206
— Doughy Daw! he cried.	174.09197057124015
WHAT WETHERUP SAID All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff.	27.92505270565936
He was in the bakery line too, wasn ’ t he?	199.74116523858373
Why they call him Doughy Daw.	135.79371769585117
Feathered his nest well anyhow.	40.66534266626026
Daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor.	64.79158319365125
Hooked that nicely.	112.77067707425105
Entertainments.	1218.4197832253003
Open house.	126.34983293253794
Big blowout.	168.37076879752516
Wetherup always said that.	90.75136214552847
Get a grip of them by the stomach.	131.7053363107943
The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in.	23.609352575081303
The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked: — What is it?	83.02773082527402
— And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.	48.58187423310376
— Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.	63.10597553320277
— Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat.	676.1777916723088
I must get a drink after that.	77.24068624697094
— Drink! the editor cried.	139.87696812166757
No drinks served before mass.	100.62930677587681
— Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out.	423.65341764547367
Come on, Ned.	88.01730971592593
Ned Lambert sidled down from the table.	94.41322495366042
The editor ’ s blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom ’ s face, shadowed by a smile.	113.72907874267564
— Will you join us, Myles?	114.30055557271949
Ned Lambert asked.	308.59016177481374
MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED — North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece.	25.563569457442654
We won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers! — Where was that, Myles?	48.51535283413766
Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps.	81.641275230437
— In Ohio! the editor shouted.	122.44025038435906
— So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.	73.96298352383614
Passing out he whispered to J.	36.20659760254022
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy: — Incipient jigs.	417.28104073550537
Sad case.	120.35500764134997
— Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.	47.57233441160229
My Ohio! — A perfect cretic! the professor said.	36.27754440215527
Long, short and long.	53.88674640690756
O, HARP EOLIAN! He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.	25.513720169739464
— Bingbang, bangbang.	366.23114992361303
Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.	78.97642462519165
— Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said.	313.47478310129554
I just want to phone about an ad.	80.90726394143248
He went in.	262.8965049010034
— What about that leader this evening?	92.56687169913548
professor MacHugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.	163.53320464758482
— That ’ ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly.	59.08204282923788
Never you fret.	599.0831378161331
Hello, Jack.	103.80705379605986
That ’ s all right.	83.05842180087714
— Good day, Myles, J.	401.1676939874008
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file.	97.06508362609047
Is that Canada swindle case on today?	70.45958912462818
The telephone whirred inside.	155.39159199576596
— Twentyeight...	533.2422477773091
Double four...	164.70733464008234
Yes.	1763.135277433406
SPOT THE WINNER Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_ ’ s tissues.	87.95872140382997
— Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup?	167.3512962146799
he asked.	72.62503664047722
Sceptre with O.	113.70409255012176
Madden up.	11.933965030498914
He tossed the tissues on to the table.	240.2610811403881
Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.	65.74131925185252
— Hush, Lenehan said.	602.3310682037833
I hear feetstoops.	274.65109524316773
Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps.	46.92673030853077
The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.	102.28753372715518
— It wasn ’ t me, sir.	1239.5685747596378
It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.	73.07591692973958
— Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said.	99.06336441398092
There ’ s a hurricane blowing.	102.15159117025932
Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.	32.471755167571466
— Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said.	372.03777914807114
It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir.	178.19679231319296
He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.	102.13863119370995
— Him, sir.	1422.8918062640603
— Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.	200.4713338248065
He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.	127.44489791263496
J.	129.7375304578709
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking: — Continued on page six, column four.	33.43919774194447
— Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.	130.14229518830794
Is the boss...?	47.95794983602534
Yes, _Telegraph_...	161.19479183427396
To where?	1557.201414626459
Aha! Which auction rooms?...	17.51070772154456
Aha! I see...	76.82775586594448
Right.	198.54428873542537
I ’ ll catch him.	250.5716556585677
A COLLISION ENSUES The bell whirred again as he rang off.	31.84531975640875
He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.	33.51788083688675
— _Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.	89.9272599205317
— My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip.	272.7376238937754
Are you hurt?	131.396789618879
I ’ m in a hurry.	124.43617894780084
— Knee, Lenehan said.	602.3310682037833
He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee: — The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.	33.06946910468172
— Sorry, Mr Bloom said.	800.9569769517572
He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused.	117.56653413837665
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy slapped the heavy pages over.	95.95652460563782
The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps: We are the boys of Wexford Who fought with heart and hand.	28.48073362037387
EXIT BLOOM — I ’ m just running round to Bachelor ’ s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes ’ s.	84.16698433798761
Want to fix it up.	124.38246835526189
They tell me he ’ s round there in Dillon ’ s.	528.4577316476314
He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces.	110.39605371943426
The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.	39.78231620605442
— Begone! he said.	504.2569269728473
The world is before you.	112.24533838100467
— Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.	542.6031779805569
J.	129.7375304578709
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan ’ s hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment.	57.817071244702085
— He ’ ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind.	114.87014114026677
Look at the young scamps after him.	257.3393423728071
— Show.	3480.3845118589998
Where?	2503.021043628515
Lenehan cried, running to the window.	228.00821506403452
A STREET CORTÈGE Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom ’ s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots.	60.50859817952903
— Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and you ’ ll kick.	301.4740582849318
O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk.	42.88617019729972
Small nines.	186.38277244620522
Steal upon larks.	112.77067707425105
He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J.	13.171983166521091
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.	219.1679567887846
— What ’ s that?	399.7624183592977
Myles Crawford said with a start.	79.262008988808
Where are the other two gone?	162.97173458477428
— Who?	969.1116642327058
the professor said, turning.	105.30719982430806
They ’ re gone round to the Oval for a drink.	175.91032208719315
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall.	116.41885695556317
Came over last night.	47.99768761068938
— Come on then, Myles Crawford said.	94.65915183897437
Where ’ s my hat?	399.33705844550605
He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket.	95.68206984798312
They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.	81.99088290848336
— He ’ s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.	123.01354337237393
— Seems to be, J.	314.98130035296083
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems.	60.45255137389995
Who has the most matches?	225.80472516567494
THE CALUMET OF PEACE He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself.	75.65986511803712
Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn.	24.009712045532225
J.	129.7375304578709
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy opened his case again and offered it.	69.41238698346483
— _Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.	180.1816106843451
The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.	74.18592139268755
He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh: ’ Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, ’ Twas empire charmed thy heart.	15.515820952157618
The professor grinned, locking his long lips.	34.75196444001067
— Eh?	2525.3402546441253
You bloody old Roman empire?	158.9928866159727
Myles Crawford said.	45.02888052373342
He took a cigarette from the open case.	51.09708460704929
Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said: — Silence for my brandnew riddle! — _Imperium romanum_, J.	62.52289870609832
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy said gently.	277.680465045487
It sounds nobler than British or Brixton.	22.66897570700456
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.	93.35533951287111
Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.	27.2173259305481
— That ’ s it, he said.	581.2969880306159
We are the fat.	132.42099857237886
You and I are the fat in the fire.	305.1917575258876
We haven ’ t got the chance of a snowball in hell.	120.86560702731
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME — Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws.	32.648816058929086
We mustn ’ t be led away by words, by sounds of words.	67.14844062668202
We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative.	44.20920174115265
He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing: — What was their civilisation?	60.07578588503992
Vast, I allow: but vile.	159.82435283948692
Cloacae: sewers.	112.77067707425105
The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to be here.	87.81565882421567
Let us build an altar to Jehovah_.	49.27271924698228
The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession.	24.47977023812921
He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to be here.	64.25552535554478
Let us construct a <URL> — Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said.	85.94068183878842
Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness ’ s, were partial to the running stream.	88.15390910437056
— They were nature ’ s gentlemen, J.	219.6424758449715
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy murmured.	565.0529495766303
But we have also Roman law.	260.20756476995206
— And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.	77.42409831254206
— Do you know that story about chief baron Palles?	76.47330856002309
J.	129.7375304578709
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy asked.	435.6743690107273
Everything was going swimmingly...	58.15120263448812
— First my riddle, Lenehan said.	200.1396901244942
Are you ready?	131.396789618879
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from the hallway.	20.981871923107114
Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.	181.77125456783108
— _Entrez, mes enfants! _ Lenehan cried.	165.7003730726855
Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety.	30.19809948707711
— How do you do?	356.12646544237197
the editor said, holding out a hand.	171.6593059062828
Come in.	194.2558086488763
Your governor is just gone.	35.503680307647784

Lenehan said to all: — Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline?	202.7716495654004
Reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply.	23.074325705284153
Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.	68.06477325139608
— Who?	969.1116642327058
the editor asked.	159.63890691282393
Bit torn off.	11.741275280480423
— Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.	74.22335440112525
— That old pelters, the editor said.	155.51780238984944
Who tore it?	581.9810943006249
Was he short taken?	241.8459496093099
On swift sail flaming From storm and south He comes, pale vampire, Mouth to my mouth.	25.720408385879132
— Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their shoulders.	133.4998282396494
Foot and mouth?	204.5755896887823
Are you turned...?	107.0292391926731
Bullockbefriending bard.	203.07158957055697
SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT — Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing.	30.400321853696482
The letter is not mine.	166.85171684182396
Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to...	55.670575035987355
— O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too.	415.2900536855438
The bloodiest old tartar God ever made.	52.52869458112032
By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter ’ s face in the Star and Garter.	102.55151929725676
Oho! A woman brought sin into the world.	52.92655347919826
For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks.	31.870063236208093
O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	73.3705161742071
— Is he a widower?	253.11804490705572
Stephen asked.	470.01027702798706
— Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the typescript.	280.8178490716254
Emperor ’ s horses.	562.2319254761583

Going to be trouble there one day.	37.49360278902321
Wild geese.	186.38277244620522
O yes, every time.	138.2355232432203
Don ’ t you forget that! — The moot point is did he forget it, J.	52.102056735971196
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy said quietly, turning a horseshoe paperweight.	70.44626814351778
Saving princes is a thank you job.	53.46320811158949
Professor MacHugh turned on him.	32.25208109103362
— And if not?	1863.6651525715727
he said.	401.7011151401686
— I ’ ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began.	132.1629502704584
A Hungarian it was one day...	220.98593500778833
LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED — We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.	33.48057180649486
Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination.	343.1429015084754
We were never loyal to the successful.	257.34696718562975
We serve them.	440.3237409655022
I teach the blatant Latin language.	78.31101947184365
I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money.	28.817587198094312
Material domination.	275.29382542023205
_Dominus! _ Lord! Where is the spirituality?	361.94880753889544
Lord Jesus?	176.3789127566854
Lord Salisbury?	176.3789127566854
But the Greek! KYRIE ELEISON! A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.	17.65008952562034
— The Greek! he said again.	296.5597713120949
_Kyrios! _ Shining word! The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not.	67.98880022478322
_Kyrie! _ The radiance of the intellect.	215.685806081931
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind.	270.47071788388865
_Kyrie eleison! _ The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.	53.08577871523556
We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium, _ that went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami.	60.939119542721066
They went under.	330.05256283115244
Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece.	13.81946844368007
Loyal to a lost cause.	239.4239572033461
He strode away from them towards the window.	491.64720523085685
— They went forth to battle, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell.	119.57968593394271
— Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise.	82.83895829043357
Owing to a brick received in the latter half of the _matinée_.	343.7070925685342
Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus! He whispered then near Stephen ’ s ear: LENEHAN ’ S LIMERICK — _There ’ s a ponderous pundit MacHugh Who wears goggles of ebony hue.	17.9876753729763
As he mostly sees double To wear them why trouble?	12.665272024132568
I can ’ t see the Joe Miller.	204.79795955807685
Can you? _ In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says.	74.29149938076841
Whose mother is beastly dead.	41.66009560005196
Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.	29.158289381271754
— That ’ ll be all right, he said.	228.3514783129343
I ’ ll read the rest after.	217.87700444344964
That ’ ll be all right.	46.24443034442977
Lenehan extended his hands in protest.	57.42374200162051
— But my riddle! he said.	177.76314428318554
What opera is like a railwayline?	421.1832795218879
— Opera?	3933.1036573861734
Mr O ’ Madden Burke ’ s sphinx face reriddled.	111.65226310534125
Lenehan announced gladly: — _The Rose of Castile_.	61.99906749149064
See the wheeze?	71.08574416532008
Rows of cast steel.	45.86835810259025
Gee! He poked Mr O ’ Madden Burke mildly in the spleen.	117.15842427551485
Mr O ’ Madden Burke fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.	40.64234015231444
— Help! he sighed.	417.81726547670183
I feel a strong weakness.	621.0450354893075
Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.	22.92228945514638
— Paris, past and present, he said.	319.488066921712
You look like communards.	206.6737561570731
— Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J.	113.72007281094248
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy said in quiet mockery.	164.78560260916018
Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you?	57.573432296022474
You look as though you had done the deed.	58.11038833079267
General Bobrikoff.	104.48244077495224
OMNIUM GATHERUM — We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.	152.0690610231317
— All the talents, Myles Crawford said.	49.81696347402093
Law, the classics...	219.871351296195
— The turf, Lenehan put in.	195.4750307414264
— Literature, the press.	1602.8664762421754
— If Bloom were here, the professor said.	301.2883663043482
The gentle art of advertisement.	132.16329158687742
— And Madam Bloom, Mr O ’ Madden Burke added.	398.88081210599955
The vocal muse.	431.5904733650626
Dublin ’ s prime favourite.	296.31915335267416
Lenehan gave a loud cough.	50.220105976527584
— Ahem! he said very softly.	301.1595016334372
O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a cold in the park.	84.04392070323766
The gate was open.	194.76844245361585
“ YOU CAN DO IT! ” The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen ’ s shoulder.	16.419388089712854
— I want you to write something for me, he said.	288.35063896941176
Something with a bite in it.	43.55494470158886
You can do it.	174.754762396528
I see it in your face.	64.82326594940758
_In the lexicon of youth_...	21.57699648986991
See it in your face.	97.59953261429989
See it in your eye.	534.8490616193634
Lazy idle little schemer.	45.24036830893671
— Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective.	35.11131891870416
Great nationalist meeting in Borris - in - Ossory.	20.894725086372787
All balls! Bulldosing the public! Give them something with a bite in it.	18.011427764907307
Put us all into it, damn its soul.	77.45616406632628
Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M ’ Carthy.	16.478334390096215
— We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	44.749309014488524
Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.	369.96763591416214
— He wants you for the pressgang, J.	411.46986875820255
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy said.	423.98501972007375
THE GREAT GALLAHER — You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.	67.50114213378627
Wait a minute.	112.35208333207989
We ’ ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence.	119.62380087266436
Gallaher, that was a pressman for you.	225.00290211758966
That was a pen.	84.93169539902077
You know how he made his mark?	241.4681809608456
I ’ ll tell you.	156.86744607906687
That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known.	46.07459630640043
I ’ ll show you.	246.02876804515034
He pushed past them to the files.	278.21302141068225
The _New York World_ cabled for a special.	173.02347547870036
Remember that time?	102.06964439335347
Professor MacHugh nodded.	53.740508129341606
— _New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.	153.59032727511797
Where it took place.	318.3868782586416
Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean.	38.00110124434009
Joe Brady and the rest of them.	112.7368169912733
Where Skin - the - Goat drove the car.	112.65846967476385
Whole route, see?	54.16049443665233
— Skin - the - Goat, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	70.16043908959682
Fitzharris.	1218.4197832253003
He has that cabman ’ s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge.	82.1895856397558
Holohan told me.	91.99824301149492
You know Holohan?	366.98962170282624
— Hop and carry one, is it?	94.25017979188641
Myles Crawford said.	45.02888052373342
— And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for the corporation.	269.89918025801177
A night watchman.	328.45820040497097
Stephen turned in surprise.	44.21956351068829
— Gumley?	3933.1036573861734
he said.	401.7011151401686
You don ’ t say so?	31.470977443391412
— Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily.	68.71491022882155
Look at here.	372.02639840782405
What did Ignatius Gallaher do?	395.07577480526436
I ’ ll tell you.	156.86744607906687
Inspiration of genius.	118.77434066426113
Cabled right away.	113.68473809546208
Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of <NUM> March?	38.78225159214192
Right.	198.54428873542537
Have you got that?	43.80335937276141
He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.	81.99484796829944
— Take page four, advertisement for Bransome ’ s coffee, let us say.	57.631092524877396
Have you got that?	43.80335937276141
Right.	198.54428873542537
The telephone whirred.	338.3405164650541
A DISTANT VOICE — I ’ ll answer it, the professor said, going.	363.53097382211064
— B is parkgate.	366.23114992361303
Good.	264.03688012757516
His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.	29.502706078886543
— T is viceregal lodge.	192.87673640034728
C is where murder took place.	40.57730619231996
K is Knockmaroon gate.	234.39891660997426
The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock ’ s wattles.	464.22418750106067
An illstarched dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat.	41.497775828746214
— Hello?	4084.512237066677
_Evening Telegraph_ here...	150.5044440473416

Yes.	1763.135277433406

<URL>. Got that?	66.91645709407648
X is Davy ’ s publichouse in upper Leeson street.	44.67510249566212
The professor came to the inner door.	275.661611817759
— Bloom is at the telephone, he said.	879.1149906044059
— Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly.	152.116311713017
X is Davy ’ s publichouse, see?	63.59423241284346
CLEVER, VERY — Clever, Lenehan said.	43.097058929009016
Very.	465.2971881638335
— Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody history.	214.81539472317962
Nightmare from which you will never awake.	61.37034522203787
— I saw it, the editor said proudly.	2666.356721816812
I was present.	543.2186935925661
Dick Adams, the besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and myself.	73.7330460221794
Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing: — Madam, I ’ m Adam.	142.19442873919954
And Able was I ere I saw Elba.	181.57048062219863
— History! Myles Crawford cried.	154.9009369396027
The Old Woman of Prince ’ s street was there first.	88.22917779246391
There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that.	21.776806965542463
Out of an advertisement.	74.59449596518344
Gregor Grey made the design for it.	36.12710084817316
That gave him the leg up.	52.10112327246403
Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the <URL> Now he ’ s got in with Blumenfeld.	92.02991149429054
That ’ s press.	327.46126441908496
That ’ s talent.	327.46126441908496
Pyatt! He was all their daddies! — The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the brother - in - law of Chris Callinan.	42.63567816092024
— Hello?...	180.67654233630986
Are you there?...	65.02217844751003
Yes, he ’ s here still.	573.9462578126729
Come across yourself.	126.36245901082567
— Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh?	227.59722046035188
the editor cried.	64.02214449875336
He flung the pages down.	127.49689659426883
— Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O ’ Madden Burke.	436.6567681630812
— Very smart, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	114.6328449697725
Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.	24.706876721692016
— Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder...	134.2543504428424
— O yes, J.	1016.2933762745827
O ’ Molloy said eagerly.	278.40368431984825
Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she ’ d buy a view of Dublin.	42.593908493198626
And it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin - the - Goat.	22.818874125351492
Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine! — They ’ re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.	27.85025349525746
Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O ’ Hagan.	63.39604553157169
Eh?	196.96504069019625
Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.	124.34465399850733
His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.	20.130865302917055
Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss?	78.88822237056836
Why did you write it then?	387.61869405951137
RHYMES AND REASONS Mouth, south.	38.19379560766976
Is the mouth south someway?	63.95960367269683
Or the south a mouth?	103.10127590334443
Must be some.	80.93300462842285
South, pout, out, shout, drouth.	66.1744177909843
Rhymes: two men dressed the same, looking the same, two by two.	52.20973877970469

He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in russet, entwining, _per l ’ aer perso_, in mauve, in purple, _quella pacifica oriafiamma_, gold of oriflamme, _di rimirar fè più <URL> But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb womb.	15.10572809060581

O ’ Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.	198.21991247050573
— My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false construction on my words.	82.64609747152497
I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running away with you.	30.56984844215642
Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke?	49.47410492042291
Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly ’ s Budget_, _Pue ’ s Occurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_.	35.122451745965485
Why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside?	62.40450358026831
Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof.	101.07901778853488
LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE — Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his face.	23.497737991511343
Irish volunteers.	178.5825216515837
Where are you now?	287.47821564601406

Dr Lucas.	120.8946647122669
Who have you now like John Philpot Curran?	72.70143130137362
Psha! — Well, J.	227.2477946039074
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy said, Bushe <URL>., for example.	132.09719361919764
— Bushe?	3933.1036573861734
the editor said.	58.62619969161668
Well, yes: Bushe, yes.	177.73644811466687
He has a strain of it in his blood.	234.1487753073554
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.	52.43608232366059
— He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for....	631.6258751082472
But no matter.	737.7661550622086
J.	129.7375304578709
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly: — One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe.	58.86502563562092
It was in that case of fratricide, the Childs murder case.	168.47579571141378
Bushe defended him.	116.15230721992182
_And in the porches of mine ear did <URL> By the way how did he find that out?	40.958636255642936
He died in his sleep.	733.5138787552141
Or the other story, beast with two backs?	63.06966215274978
— What was that?	307.53761957271144
the professor asked.	96.61920215523338
ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM — He spoke on the law of evidence, J.	80.71762112792202
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy said, of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_.	82.40312364442254
And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.	98.31939673941312
— Ha. — A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced.	94.2956529532747
J.	129.7375304578709
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy took out his cigarettecase.	142.38376872529943
False lull.	275.29382542023205
Something quite ordinary.	76.53362296965327
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.	22.715680996769887
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.	34.44410521872841
A POLISHED PERIOD J.	156.06002609283783
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy resumed, moulding his words: — He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to <URL> His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.	25.25616363971811
— Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.	111.78337857638809
— The divine afflatus, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	87.28283303915899
— You like it?	603.8785875735285
J.	129.7375304578709
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy asked Stephen.	237.94727322471215
Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.	49.941336045080725
He took a cigarette from the case.	92.77522236482
J.	129.7375304578709
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy offered his case to Myles Crawford.	89.30210005861817
Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying: — Muchibus thankibus.	24.757229838499264
A MAN OF HIGH MORALE — Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.	43.991764402313805
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy said to Stephen.	2231.6371474925236
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A.	181.40306037077445
E.	189.06299250251155
the mastermystic?	191.61621781209834
She was a nice old bag of tricks.	59.03704579790453
A.	14508.205342004916
E.	189.06299250251155
has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness.	132.5199374223542
Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A.	103.35491065677898
E. ’ s leg.	471.7295932331514
He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.	124.01773452535869
Speaking about me.	114.33121497510015
What did he say?	95.17287095799595
What did he say?	95.17287095799595
What did he say about me?	69.31353156596013
Don ’ t ask.	35.71292096532658
— No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.	151.33639866195833
Wait a moment.	77.75085847869916
Let me say one thing.	638.482586247
The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society.	37.135619457211426
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.	32.43120578832252
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said: — You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.	38.37663509030534
Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.	163.6244631407737
— He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.	40.94255436241332
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy said, rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission.	210.38138466851277
— He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child ’ s frock.	111.59531729930231
Go on.	145.16932195242967
— It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man ’ s contumely upon the new movement.	56.179637334427916
It was then a new movement.	136.55929352555302
We were weak, therefore worthless.	66.3451910749925
He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.	26.93567970254543
IMPROMPTU In ferial tone he addressed J.	26.578926128553665
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy: — Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.	106.03497211603968
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall.	47.71992711754115
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it.	30.96595885528299
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.	27.033733376055398
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.	50.641556684360346
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy ’ s towards Stephen ’ s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking.	215.50765188349098
His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair.	24.81996379769653
Still seeking, he said: — When Fitzgibbon ’ s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.	61.11196748176795
Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.	105.92326311979252
He raised his head firmly.	308.12711613026715
His eyes bethought themselves once more.	59.71326287963426
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.	41.22115341223854
He began: _ — Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend.	21.42750556166792
It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful <URL> His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech.	38.33463250150448
_And let our crooked <URL> Noble words coming.	17.358821602778605
Could you try your hand at it yourself?	112.31416240145644
_ — And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.	35.74697046587613
I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to <URL> FROM THE FATHERS It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted.	19.368669438860614
Ah, curse you! That ’ s saint Augustine.	136.9536061215686
_ — Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language?	22.829799833491315
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.	31.40817341156679
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe.	13.958068886066682
You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a <URL> Nile.	33.34810040545359
Child, man, effigy.	251.00392313037946
By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.	14.933694149186802
_ — You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas.	15.692839188762898
Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms.	12.649733577393969
Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our <URL> A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech.	28.677263723567368
He lifted his voice above it boldly: _ — But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day.	18.59830658278395
He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai ’ s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the <URL> He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.	34.087074088766464
OMINOUS — FOR HIM! J.	30.216215550502355
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy said not without regret: — And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.	79.78775300131045
— A — sudden — at — the — moment — though — from — lingering — illness — often — previously — expectorated — demise, Lenehan added.	9.3526944970955
And with a great future behind him.	101.19582257950222
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase.	17.712371806221807
— That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.	184.18673469054428
Gone with the wind.	178.91543913865692
Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.	93.08078083601497
Miles of ears of porches.	34.17524935538088
The tribune ’ s words, howled and scattered to the four winds.	133.63719363870942
A people sheltered within his voice.	81.7869101051523
Dead noise.	120.35500764134997
Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was.	97.4090433725543
Love and laud him: me no more.	59.87324190438222
I have money.	491.4207718473069
— Gentlemen, Stephen said.	225.0885816496309
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn?	105.896938517531
— You take my breath away.	153.4147649748312
It is not perchance a French compliment?	73.4968026429029
Mr O ’ Madden Burke asked.	85.90888604761834
’ Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.	27.481714042660347
— That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved.	79.17427476606412
All that are in favour say ay, Lenehan announced.	37.88612067783496
The contrary no.	431.9210372978534
I declare it carried.	188.52332607185355
To which particular boosing shed...?	47.20756590682858
My casting vote is: Mooney ’ s! He led the way, admonishing: — We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not?	28.541065753762915
Yes, we will not.	230.93930576981717
By no manner of means.	38.470606110644546
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally ’ s lunge of his umbrella: — Lay on, Macduff! — Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the shoulder.	62.232177297773916
Let us go.	249.36806203183744
Where are those blasted keys?	127.51606285644732
He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.	102.46311973143602
— Foot and mouth.	2556.736932603143
I know.	422.21812241641607
That ’ ll be all right.	46.24443034442977
That ’ ll go in.	118.85732811339594
Where are they?	376.69563795337365
That ’ s all right.	83.05842180087714
He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.	98.44117299100304
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen: — I hope you will live to see it published.	205.49888052706265
Myles, one moment.	832.6171208573485
He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.	131.47896725894896
— Come along, Stephen, the professor said.	161.6332660322921
That is fine, isn ’ t it?	46.12818504598434
It has the prophetic vision.	53.99198103059222
_Fuit Ilium! _ The sack of windy Troy.	49.12820680786459
Kingdoms of this world.	109.73809742227625
The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.	182.09492777740672
The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling: — Racing special! Dublin.	42.28661116428568
I have much, much to learn.	105.6792665482706
They turned to the left along Abbey street.	95.12675913262933
— I have a vision too, Stephen said.	279.0472529351418
— Yes?	2592.6619381671294
the professor said, skipping to get into step.	191.80808747727238
Crawford will follow.	112.77067707425105
Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran: — Racing special! DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN Dubliners.	28.0671618605828
— Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally ’ s lane.	44.9115231099228
— Where is that?	1045.9920502423836
the professor asked.	96.61920215523338
— Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.	113.4906314606944
Damp night reeking of hungry dough.	29.566217255787716
Against the wall.	73.20025056729105
Face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl.	24.44486220865739
Frantic hearts.	275.29382542023205
Akasic records.	203.07158957055697
Quicker, darlint! On now.	34.17219939302598
Dare it.	275.5388195470069
Let there be life.	244.8765431976606
— They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	81.77567196830064
They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox.	40.62017990049968
They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife.	33.64813733248268
Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers.	21.22834673024449
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.	61.756032106886956
— Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.	87.27055003860042
LIFE ON THE RAW — They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins, proprietress...	13.615345804888916
They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson ’ s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn.	48.48027795035746
They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.	55.70702912064644
Glory be to God.	62.66666227687846
They had no idea it was that high.	112.47719731169902
Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe.	18.44973866640593
Anne Kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father.	25.701375303694142
Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.	16.791365027486844
— Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice.	265.6541626491154
Vestal virgins.	275.29382542023205
I can see them.	733.729209837935
What ’ s keeping our friend?	294.6055741775251
He turned.	1476.115424146351
A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering.	17.233702902348377
Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking with J.	69.85943902253176
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy.	1086.9864319128874
— Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.	122.41159428021402
He set off again to walk by Stephen ’ s side.	136.9958977424971
RETURN OF BLOOM — Yes, he said.	110.01439739053812
I see them.	381.6127101996694
Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called: — Mr Crawford! A moment! — _Telegraph_! Racing special! — What is it?	25.810781812280002
Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.	73.403617858487
A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom ’ s face: — Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows! INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR — Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket.	41.9197873516124
I spoke with Mr Keyes just now.	67.2599096866878
He ’ ll give a renewal for two months, he says.	108.32248344553504
After he ’ ll see.	188.8641469027027
But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the Saturday pink.	184.68899126152823
And he wants it copied if it ’ s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_.	77.15623763512683
I can have access to it in the national library.	189.59641339774296
House of keys, don ’ t you see?	28.381329045841145
His name is Keyes.	217.8647238540571
It ’ s a play on the name.	224.22135622153277
But he practically promised he ’ d give the renewal.	30.19045170884798
But he wants just a little puff.	228.38568757812544
What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?	605.5412219266561
<URL>. — Will you tell him he can kiss my arse?	33.68054763345316
Myles Crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis.	31.471152818116988
Tell him that straight from the stable.	145.11568255799645
Look out for squalls.	107.08248151484887
All off for a drink.	187.9106244532457

Usual blarney.	203.07158957055697
Has a good pair of boots on him today.	146.1997257125313
Last time I saw him he had his heels on view.	128.26616746923702
Been walking in muck somewhere.	39.98267725457155
What was he doing in Irishtown?	211.9640171805658
— Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I suppose it ’ s worth a short par.	233.63826835236708
He ’ d give the ad, I think.	89.35777550199737
I ’ ll tell him...	207.72797882403154
<URL>. — He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his shoulder.	30.668735036565263
Any time he likes, tell him.	36.77811563565344
RAISING THE WIND — _Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin.	31.34613498006957
I ’ m up to here.	162.6052135634369
I ’ ve been through the hoop myself.	158.07851546883327
I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week.	71.27495043718842
Sorry, Jack.	97.47248346536126
You must take the will for the deed.	107.85213501450446

O ’ Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently.	80.60238457828993
They caught up on the others and walked abreast.	411.0420782808781
— When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings.	56.82709624634924
— Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford.	335.3327726011717
Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	57.1377347078343
SOME COLUMN! — THAT ’ S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID — That ’ s new, Myles Crawford said.	23.788767492243196

Out for the waxies ’ Dargle.	186.4771545000432
Two old trickies, what?	29.043813802954944
— But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.	67.81878158744769
They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines ’ blue dome, Adam and Eve ’ s, saint Laurence O ’ Toole ’ s.	26.359689677287314
THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES — Easy all, Myles Crawford said.	19.121068023229395
No poetic licence.	400.9555695172086
We ’ re in the archdiocese here.	209.7892209632783
— And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer.	202.77333578678594
— Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried.	150.71736515248926
I like that.	1263.360823716072
I see the idea.	421.4155461994776
I see what you mean.	306.32509472484963
DAMES DONATE DUBLIN ’ S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF — It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak.	32.54221585556517
They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.	29.893560069754788
He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close.	100.92968633299704
Lenehan and Mr O ’ Madden Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney ’ s.	31.8226508795856
— Finished?	3933.1036573861734
Myles Crawford said.	45.02888052373342
So long as they do no worse.	103.00876457388729
SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS.	112.77067707425105
— You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist.	82.49830791947929
It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself.	32.0344583290309
He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman.	105.77608632603781
And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.	30.65908772734389
Poor Penelope.	189.02278011911127

Myles Crawford asked.	118.3516454398759
Where did they get the plums?	48.68904698715081

Call it, let me see.	362.98494029990474
Call it: _deus nobis hæc otia <URL> — No, Stephen said.	32.865908860100944
I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of The <URL> — I see, the professor said.	27.731715221749443
He laughed richly.	224.72342301827328
— I see, he said again with new pleasure.	335.529606677236

They wheeled, flapping.	150.89608638442678
The hungry famished gull Flaps o ’ er the waters dull.	28.50919399156333
That is how poets write, the similar sounds.	53.87877061524059

O rocks! Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice.	109.98042323939838
She ’ s right after all.	240.35446485623484
Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.	65.9934840902237
She ’ s not exactly witty.	262.9737836151697
Can be rude too.	66.73602272410537
Blurt out what I was thinking.	190.12814647556877
Still, I don ’ t know.	161.0364701680438
She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice.	170.36849972821756
He has legs like barrels and you ’ d think he was singing into a barrel.	75.56258674234914
Now, isn ’ t that wit.	214.82629954573602
They used to call him big Ben.	346.38563419812186
Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone.	18.343591752697904
Appetite like an albatross.	90.92148119267617
Get outside of a baron of beef.	41.74546669554785
Barrel of Bass.	112.77067707425105
It all works out.	202.45258064229395
A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards.	15.688368237978336
Bargains.	1218.4197832253003
Like that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered.	94.55214294117934

Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked.	24.864908681531794
Our staple food.	77.35840594578919
Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street.	49.66079247266082
Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly.	23.1046653972785
Doesn ’ t bring in any business either.	39.07928721056058
I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper.	24.69670799270903
I bet that would have caught on.	172.54028755583838
Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once.	23.309931677733058
Everyone dying to know what she ’ s writing.	226.57222126723954
Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing.	57.44496581246909
Women too.	89.24594419461651
Curiosity.	812.0832237234374
Pillar of salt.	115.92781122991094
Wouldn ’ t have it of course because he didn ’ t think of it himself first.	265.08940081028953
Or the inkbottle I suggested with a false stain of black celluloid.	40.5093868307806
His ideas for ads like Plumtree ’ s potted under the obituaries, cold meat department.	47.69063783665009
You can ’ t lick ’ em.	184.7550105123747
What?	1560.489681896445
Our envelopes.	171.86428112536083
Hello, Jones, where are you going?	51.99554267520611

Sister?	13.553989839292583
I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes.	67.38612149520829
Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman.	43.554051249678835
I disturbed her at her devotions that morning.	73.35530485703035
But glad to communicate with the outside world.	96.34756551661988
Our great day, she said.	393.1125404153658
Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.	30.411514311716143
Sweet name too: caramel.	35.32797154915783
She knew I, I think she knew by the way she.	100.56635354400174
If she had married she would have changed.	63.12191403933846
I suppose they really were short of money.	100.46738459033321
Fried everything in the best butter all the same.	318.4830650236444
No lard for them.	182.95498650041256
My heart ’ s broke eating dripping.	99.39539020810764

Year Phil Gilligan died.	56.1838370774367
We were in Lombard street west.	240.69169045729637

As if that.	132.50860025626994
Old Goodwin ’ s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff.	101.62965549010795
Flies ’ picnic too.	62.200804154614865
Never put a dress on her back like it.	86.733279249577

Just beginning to plump it out well.	120.59673882820778
Rabbitpie we had that day.	110.87301603879791

My memory is getting.	53.18180398977023
Pen...?	97.94837632571887
Of course it ’ s years ago.	115.3936668853245
Noise of the trams probably.	396.14713278082365
Well, if he couldn ’ t remember the dayfather ’ s name that he sees every day.	144.00135479509876
Bartell d ’ Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then.	39.656613076254274
Seeing her home after practice.	38.07061810671304
Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache.	91.5334480645827
Gave her that song _Winds that blow from the south_.	28.99528797916934
Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin ’ s concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house.	74.38322705686322
He and I behind.	569.5213905925193
Sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings.	45.60012600150162
Lucky it didn ’ t.	137.85681370550884
Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her.	133.2786835661686

Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust.	26.916871003851618
Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin.	22.433630980237258
She did get flushed in the wind.	135.7489085302477
Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked.	26.743975871522373
And the mulled rum.	134.0514862124585
Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays: white.	38.786287773447214
Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed.	46.02584623177173
Always warm from her.	55.111704665789055

That was the night...	552.1351917738943
— O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?	379.6216339285713
— O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?	312.41900568056263
— No use complaining.	491.0457919843233
How is Molly those times?	206.74622381484076
Haven ’ t seen her for ages.	31.985457856057344
— In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily.	339.7148035768015
Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.	71.94152388970898
— Go away! Isn ’ t that grand for her?	85.62415101245817
— Yes.	1061.8201792287966
In a photographer ’ s there.	334.12109583748884
Getting on like a house on fire.	136.85042069345343
How are all your charges?	206.99340960681607
— All on the baker ’ s list, Mrs Breen said.	193.7907482950158
— You ’ re in black, I see.	176.5756331611794
You have no...	207.82321173719143
— No, Mr Bloom said.	917.9517167545029
I have just come from a funeral.	91.78288865381491
Going to crop up all day, I foresee.	277.10251969897155
Who ’ s dead, when and what did he die of?	221.08054601441373
Turn up like a bad penny.	56.641307714648725
— O, dear me, Mrs Breen said.	473.9066403767777
I hope it wasn ’ t any near relation.	122.67561593776922
May as well get her sympathy.	47.31480398594777
— Dignam, Mr Bloom said.	787.828021017532
An old friend of mine.	25.890695132000047
He died quite suddenly, poor fellow.	59.90495573154514
Heart trouble, I believe.	66.56093751332634
Funeral was this morning.	55.25400367733372
Your funeral ’ s tomorrow While you ’ re coming through the rye.	190.5199397261182
Diddlediddle dumdum Diddlediddle...	50.82525020401551
— Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen ’ s womaneyes said melancholily.	81.92135224586481
Now that ’ s quite enough about that.	18.935189968215358
Just: quietly: husband.	42.73685969398705
— And your lord and master?	305.08177903235764
Hasn ’ t lost them anyhow.	165.8849270045951
— O, don ’ t be talking! she said.	67.90292665917278
He ’ s a caution to rattlesnakes.	139.14323354600089
He ’ s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel.	158.27423117010736
He has me heartscalded.	159.9565836605946
Wait till I show you.	30.08636448079725
Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison ’ s.	15.813935365690153
The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom ’ s gullet.	305.8507511696295
Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they ’ d taste it with the hot tea.	29.112672898091915
Or is it from her?	367.7573442424951
A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes.	100.37909212303093
Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way.	25.26171710717208
Pleasure or pain is it?	41.338977197711266
Penny dinner.	13.64610561238065
Knife and fork chained to the table.	60.603743274528675

Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle.	50.78059647831953
Pastille that was fell.	602.9136684165649
What is she?...	360.284022105648
— There must be a new moon out, she said.	158.2083371730776
He ’ s always bad then.	156.26669759836363
Do you know what he did last night?	500.4523303778051
Her hand ceased to rummage.	33.97616801820912
Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.	28.515489368055416
— What?	1096.145065448642
Mr Bloom asked.	160.51135127088145
Let her speak.	372.09946884160723
Look straight in her eyes.	48.95850465672133
I believe you.	472.63336247576785
Trust me.	204.06012989696865
— Woke me up in the night, she said.	149.89664868470342
Dream he had, a nightmare.	380.77485158997865
Indiges.	1218.4197832253003
— Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.	38.31751641424963
— The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.	83.91996796533164
She took a folded postcard from her handbag.	26.085083736701232
— Read that, she said.	708.396079876378
He got it this morning.	154.33676441167682
— What is it?	608.0440085668911
Mr Bloom asked, taking the card.	103.55331007027233
U.	195.00677118397383
P.?	1842.2090729582007
— U.	3933.1036573861734
p: up, she said.	133.81749121261956
Someone taking a rise out of him.	30.637678857839408
It ’ s a great shame for them whoever he is.	59.30883962220997
— Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.	768.9060877068639
She took back the card, sighing.	28.161310427843084
— And now he ’ s going round to Mr Menton ’ s office.	304.13281297096927
He ’ s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.	146.79368907494043
She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.	38.77476795559842
Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching.	51.76500979795959
Seen its best days.	50.78059647831953
Wispish hair over her ears.	72.59778889751541
And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to take the harm out of it.	26.432614142864377
Shabby genteel.	275.29382542023205
She used to be a tasty dresser.	192.45069629146985
Lines round her mouth.	304.35835994229666
Only a year or so older than Molly.	23.329565965625086
See the eye that woman gave her, passing.	38.078285960944896
Cruel.	525.8816296405445
The unfair sex.	431.5904733650626

Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny.	50.78059647831953
I ’ m hungry too.	102.64459590105626

— Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy?	183.78274135928652
Mr Bloom asked.	160.51135127088145
— Mina Purefoy?	1492.7666661252408
she said.	168.06246617837547
Philip Beaufoy I was thinking.	83.80895385896292
Playgoers ’ Club.	129.53949124709393
Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke.	153.96566660604304
Did I pull the chain?	44.19460561120026

Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her: — Mind! Let this man pass.	33.43826263547901
A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass.	36.83165856632326

Ay. He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the flutes.	55.24951702266788
— Ay, he said, sighing.	2579.7949960570954
Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh.	49.26220570924834
Will I tell him that horse Lenehan?	44.318136551558574

No sound.	833.713334245954
The sky.	1203.0029477661017
Green by Drumleck.	56.5222700052377
Yellowgreen towards Sutton.	112.77067707425105
Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities.	31.519049848772703
Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you ’ ll toss me all.	54.25721670730322
O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away.	34.9760028479464
Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth.	38.536114277554375
Yum.	1218.4197832253003
Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed.	53.68205054235388
Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle.	40.13942070115409

She lay still.	466.33660299592884
A goat.	1047.493585384237
No - one.	133.58547315545061
Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded.	29.566217255787716
Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman ’ s breasts full in her blouse of nun ’ s veiling, fat nipples upright.	31.414358192594186
Hot I tongued her.	34.13194258920142
She kissed me.	367.594851407628
All yielding she tossed my hair.	34.68219657551607
Kissed, she kissed me.	327.73458311180593
Me. And me now.	46.444715469227106
Stuck, the flies buzzed.	306.8613037343729
His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab.	102.2286412355239

All to see.	553.3178304001569
Never speaking.	2220.2920584492217
I mean to say to fellows like Flynn.	119.79131062367394
Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first?	13.616877525086354
Mortal! Put you in your proper place.	137.1848565507743
Quaffing nectar at mess with gods golden dishes, all ambrosial.	19.86568394499398
Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop.	31.53957824372255
Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian.	24.456737217190444
Immortal lovely.	275.29382542023205
And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine.	16.79564083651487
They have no.	32.05188952088726
Never looked.	2220.2920584492217
I ’ ll look today.	261.02400368884025
Bend down let something fall see if she.	36.47976378138666
Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do.	128.07464357956806
A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.	26.467261437888297
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book: — What is this he is?	112.5437078817579
Isn ’ t he in the insurance line?	197.4617818300074
— He ’ s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said.	1045.3336510397867
He does canvassing for the <URL> — I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said.	150.932979861105
Is he in trouble?	58.31348138233335
— Trouble?	3933.1036573861734
Nosey Flynn said.	192.83956467860196
Not that I heard of.	100.4999750632321
Why?	2421.489910325178
— Was he?	413.97725916075666
Nosey Flynn said.	192.83956467860196
So he was, faith.	225.4640314151207
I asked him how was all at home.	19.837693846953506
You ’ re right, by God.	130.71031407113276
So he was.	812.911960687326
— I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way.	89.87130378139747
It only brings it up fresh in their minds.	96.59406044563428
— It ’ s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.	165.44970840597014
I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan ’ s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half.	49.98192013660911
She ’ s well nourished, I tell you.	83.38143967710872
Plovers on toast.	112.77067707425105
— And is he doing for the _Freeman? _ Davy Byrne said.	212.2045196881411
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.	42.39186429560813
You can make bacon of that.	196.738684793627
— How so?	746.5333402038484
Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.	45.795092529925526
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers.	45.98521619689191
He winked.	1484.2292913684553
— He ’ s in the craft, he said.	1288.649555295426
— Do you tell me so?	2038.4739865257347
Davy Byrne said.	38.19654240622938
— Very much so, Nosey Flynn said.	318.9464637207658
Ancient free and accepted order.	52.52776235598712
He ’ s an excellent brother.	147.40340699811065
Light, life and love, by God.	39.94627865877071
They give him a leg up.	109.89207420181906
I was told that by a — well, I won ’ t say who.	74.46131611823482
— Is that a fact?	95.1359391604626
— O, it ’ s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said.	127.74006597290162
They stick to you when you ’ re down.	356.98614435120743
But they ’ re as close as damn it.	43.867882860588814
By God they did right to keep the women out of it.	65.517623636762
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one: — Iiiiiichaaaaaaach! — There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing.	84.63532670320068
But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason.	43.821359970432724
That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.	154.66268094098402
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes: — And is that a fact?	47.2209897111549
Decent quiet man he is.	48.55946930631599
I often saw him in here and I never once saw him — you know, over the line.	96.30889417468238
— God Almighty couldn ’ t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.	116.60924544591761
Slips off when the fun gets too hot.	37.9783290459387
Didn ’ t you see him look at his watch?	100.47421715386591
Ah, you weren ’ t there.	567.7529301225579
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe.	112.51185618567607
Declare to God he does.	53.04950681552669
— There are some like that, Davy Byrne said.	217.38291989473626
— He ’ s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.	218.13650214107807
He ’ s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow.	105.7056701894932
Give the devil his due.	50.65885963773492
O, Bloom has his good points.	376.45913644596897
But there ’ s one thing he ’ ll never do.	160.54185576775376
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.	21.947917567277873
— I know, Davy Byrne said.	150.47740626050307
— Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.	113.82435269569984
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in.	29.310744142720193
Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.	47.99482409479751
— Day, Mr Byrne.	974.8831698848005
— Day, gentlemen.	347.0117804240736
They paused at the counter.	585.6073625646587
— Who ’ s standing?	1217.4574389841862
Paddy Leonard asked.	48.73000488351223
— I ’ m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.	115.50553992702756
— Well, what ’ ll it be?	1042.6060522727994
Paddy Leonard asked.	48.73000488351223
— I ’ ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.	89.90461610592803
— How much?	475.07697443805114
Paddy Leonard cried.	71.40363082735738
Since when, for God ’ sake?	206.0254796484175
What ’ s yours, Tom?	372.181951799683
— How is the main drainage?	692.8338238016106
Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.	61.06687321598138
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.	22.467695304485126
— Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne?	173.04066674404837
he said.	401.7011151401686
— Certainly, sir.	132.11822538696453
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.	29.339718449024733
— Lord love a duck, he said.	323.5455915870208
Look at what I ’ m standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.	18.178424265703974
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup.	71.76508065747453
A dead snip.	257.49112647396123
— Zinfandel is it?	373.3187360125673
Nosey Flynn asked.	90.75331433532875
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.	64.8586224924468
— That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.	356.2407458679128
— Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.	70.85689047317288
Tom Rochford nodded and drank.	39.66329565977442
— Is it Zinfandel?	249.87745000183904
— Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked.	89.84863007529867
I ’ m going to plunge five bob on my own.	59.684532645171515
— Tell us if you ’ re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said.	82.96264070758764
Who gave it to you?	2996.025871088802
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.	44.13759751026599
— So long! Nosey Flynn said.	66.49612171664126
The others turned.	496.1399783086704
— Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn.	125.98226846110774
Mr Byrne, sir, we ’ ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a...	73.75521894965394
— Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.	110.26416984024422
— Ay, Paddy Leonard said.	133.70492570918984
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth.	33.896712595708074
Something green it would have to be: spinach, say.	40.46147380057531
Then with those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.	64.52576494840277
At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest.	44.84947679247707
Surfeit.	1218.4197832253003
Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents.	16.754701754984534
First sweet then savoury.	45.470002615837984
Mr Bloom coasted warily.	208.12853416879847
Ruminants.	1218.4197832253003
Their upper jaw they move.	30.362530694177284
Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his?	60.47258542307766
Wasting time explaining it to Flynn ’ s mouth.	203.88432482967158
Lean people long mouths.	47.95886141701586
Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free.	39.66890991280015
Course then you ’ d have all the cranks pestering.	101.33603134943883
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars: Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M ’ invitasti.	49.478882229036714
Feel better.	115.26477517965498
Burgundy.	1218.4197832253003
Good pick me up.	73.91918956116258
Who distilled first?	465.7557828977208
Some chap in the blues.	236.651071742123
Dutch courage.	275.29382542023205
That _Kilkenny People_ in the national library now I must.	32.54901560440005
Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts.	45.130021329370216
They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes.	31.768504155574472
But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show.	73.3937915408364
— _A cenar <URL> What does that _teco_ mean?	61.22819498623368
Tonight perhaps.	203.2421965234124
Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited To come to supper tonight, The rum the rumdum.	32.1231009485226
Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to.	88.15744551544545
That ’ ll be two pounds ten about two pounds eight.	30.75077914142851
Three Hynes owes me.	46.97713166913744
Two eleven.	184.07690422966877
Prescott ’ s dyeworks van over there.	131.9060024842315
If I get Billy Prescott ’ s ad: two fifteen.	102.88858987693031
Five guineas about.	54.76268542367255
On the pig ’ s back.	798.5496962178416
Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.	21.250998731130142
Today.	469.9420631433986
Not think.	240.27606288632472
Tour the south then.	105.10466272013991
What about English wateringplaces?	125.66791383422964
Brighton, Margate.	140.4819215127848
Piers by moonlight.	129.53949124709393
Her voice floating out.	183.96582581651853
Those lovely seaside girls.	34.1307054875426
Against John Long ’ s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle.	19.549877568849638
Handy man wants job.	62.200804154614865
Small wages.	186.38277244620522
Will eat anything.	84.13218527608706
Mr Bloom turned at Gray ’ s confectioner ’ s window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan ’ s bookstore.	79.12796151495894
_Why I left the church of Rome?	88.36092259642493
Birds ’ <URL> Women run him.	30.346296264523524
They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.	137.18886037494124
Same bait.	166.25074873357315
No tram in sight.	251.85009905255768
Wants to cross.	16.349476660407674
— Do you want to cross?	341.8844620657533
Mr Bloom asked.	160.51135127088145
The blind stripling did not answer.	112.21475765482208
His wallface frowned weakly.	177.08660789298088
He moved his head uncertainly.	64.70021788014866
— You ’ re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said.	120.50321937073942
Molesworth street is opposite.	62.200804154614865
Do you want to cross?	133.5763058975421
There ’ s nothing in the way.	350.9317075855276
The cane moved out trembling to the left.	91.29762595434562
Mr Bloom ’ s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks ’ van drawn up before Drago ’ s.	33.42349952489908
Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was.	61.561152353252986
Horse drooping.	203.07158957055697
Driver in John Long ’ s.	132.35854258160956
Slaking his drouth.	129.53949124709393
— There ’ s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it ’ s not moving.	506.266951007317
I ’ ll see you across.	137.79278888409385
— Yes, the stripling answered.	879.9337016289968
South Frederick street.	84.88270053032367
— Come, Mr Bloom said.	586.7454161688626
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.	42.95013427264625
Say something to him.	260.01821635429286
Better not do the condescending.	44.616861443526034
They mistrust what you tell them.	166.42468287795336
Pass a common remark.	47.95886141701586
— The rain kept off.	146.59512578670646
No answer.	998.1495691579609
Stains on his coat.	458.66127998866904
Slobbers his food, I suppose.	358.75422995163615
Tastes all different for him.	39.26067242187509
Have to be spoonfed first.	93.98622644991278
Like a child ’ s hand, his hand.	220.24512033813883
Like Milly ’ s was.	289.7150618989444
Sensitive.	812.0832237234374
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.	37.82189826800993
Wonder if he has a name.	250.91064494046196
Van.	812.0832237234374
Keep his cane clear of the horse ’ s legs: tired drudge get his doze.	51.12226018758909
That ’ s right.	148.68410090388267
Behind a bull: in front of a horse.	19.480725357411632
— Thanks, sir.	1163.7047385583478
Knows I ’ m a man.	39.38143393117546
Voice.	1218.4197832253003
— Right now?	578.1778440518227
First turn to the left.	124.63315977632644
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.	26.692643152749298
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed.	16.84821653085929
Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?	24.665126796495738
Must have felt it.	59.67301451644735
See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume.	63.18268920779103
Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.	95.11295566621475
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed.	45.759012726502434
Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.	52.9774207242052
Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn ’ t that cane?	49.70976737568458
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.	67.09583897363653
Penrose! That was that chap ’ s name.	338.1737460529603
Look at all the things they can learn to do.	252.91682678449766
Read with their fingers.	74.89187510218031
Tune pianos.	275.29382542023205
Or we are surprised they have any brains.	95.47560340472855
Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.	29.857108247270247
Of course the other senses are more.	47.01153178469409
Embroider.	1218.4197832253003
Plait baskets.	275.29382542023205
People ought to help.	135.2383293001716
Workbasket I could buy for Molly ’ s birthday.	118.81253184652873
Hates sewing.	275.29382542023205
Might take an objection.	56.355815190798836
Dark men they call them.	10.108223293244114
Sense of smell must be stronger too.	36.986114809936026
Smells on all sides, bunched together.	24.594212766464928
Then the spring, the summer: smells.	181.74988929794074
Tastes?	724.3403374961829
They say you can ’ t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head.	72.43667416844545
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.	186.44058255291836
And with a woman, for instance.	263.33017123813585
More shameless not seeing.	51.27703448236547
That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air.	42.440172252883485
Look at me.	598.3153639019386
I have them all on.	263.41606026884614
Must be strange not to see her.	119.5378287864753
Kind of a form in his mind ’ s eye.	134.91476041720492
The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves.	82.25493609364159
His hands on her hair, for instance.	217.9617035058805
Say it was black, for instance.	120.84348809191515
Good.	264.03688012757516
We call it black.	404.69093578063473
Then passing over her white skin.	116.00253076419934
Different feel perhaps.	82.5991151036625
Feeling of white.	185.36700675669638
Postoffice.	724.3403374961829
Fag today.	275.29382542023205
Send her a postal order two shillings, half a crown.	10.375172737192095
Accept my little present.	60.98429491669431
Stationer ’ s just here too.	218.24292929915265
Wait.	199.9002065950114
Think over it.	60.775591215024434
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears.	22.640422663816878
Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek.	153.60341874105768
Downy hair there too.	79.30637133720069
Not smooth enough.	101.06839737415997
The belly is the smoothest.	277.19780516560417
No - one about.	624.1778576429065
There he goes into Frederick street.	31.971800309871035
Perhaps to Levenston ’ s dancing academy piano.	80.32584670103151
Might be settling my braces.	26.56764409915879
Walking by Doran ’ s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly.	35.51097482109481
But I know it ’ s whitey yellow.	237.23510444866963
Want to try in the dark to see.	273.3137076185261
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.	57.708428909017805
Poor fellow! Quite a boy.	34.57057657431679
Terrible.	684.2060590120853
What dreams would he have, not seeing?	233.10473805374926
Life a dream for him.	46.63602556097563
Where is the justice being born that way?	214.9472719017287
All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York.	9.382641012453062
Holocaust.	1218.4197832253003
Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.	13.983641977609965
Dear, dear, dear.	185.10454838323054
Pity, of course: but somehow you can ’ t cotton on to them someway.	135.5617106222718
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons ’ hall.	56.60473835143086
Solemn as Troy.	88.40530891686868
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace.	26.9255869914766
Old legal cronies cracking a magnum.	22.817825892679256
Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school.	125.73890861820078
I sentenced him to ten years.	379.6386752309857
I suppose he ’ d turn up his nose at that stuff I drank.	144.962835387024
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle.	143.77742873181478
Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder ’ s court.	144.1233827041816
Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime.	12.889285830482935
Sends them to the rightabout.	256.60610296845863
The devil on moneylenders.	153.9648931809019
Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling.	58.80929200084974
Now he ’ s really what they call a dirty jew.	99.68351301421744
Power those judges have.	47.98695344115792
Crusty old topers in wigs.	40.66534266626026
Bear with a sore paw.	88.91928272578988
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.	43.60313235323772
Hello, placard.	153.80013654837268
His Excellency the lord lieutenant.	91.439754456215
Sixteenth.	1218.4197832253003
Today it is.	450.92419033278844
In aid of funds for Mercer ’ s hospital.	128.06760763843624
_The Messiah_ was first given for that.	18.004845595999797
Yes.	1763.135277433406
Handel.	1218.4197832253003
What about going out there: Ballsbridge.	100.32632427643155
No use sticking to him like a leech.	148.20284920638176
Wear out my welcome.	62.200804154614865
Sure to know someone on the gate.	394.5665036932813
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street.	428.4413665737004
First I must.	80.73780260053114
Library.	1218.4197832253003
Straw hat in sunlight.	98.73762194830363
Tan shoes.	275.29382542023205
Turnedup trousers.	275.29382542023205
It is.	850.9665119892003
It is.	850.9665119892003
His heart quopped softly.	198.7735677946595
To the right.	57.001489433935966
Museum.	1218.4197832253003
Goddesses.	1218.4197832253003
He swerved to the right.	357.985886162722
Is it?	156.88872801159064
Almost certain.	178.5825216515837
Wine in my face.	140.8743336722944
Why did I?	2261.477337436171
Too heady.	1967.0133502066292
Yes, it is.	450.18113120360033
The walk.	1473.6388010057888
Not see.	240.8090027098153
Get on.	176.4711774004172
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.	71.92894430183662
Handsome building.	186.38277244620522
Sir Thomas Deane designed.	31.822460568945274
Not following me?	125.90402962634685
Didn ’ t see me perhaps.	91.91329559706395
Light in his eyes.	566.1536941760602
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs.	105.8299628117034
Quick.	205.8047902042597
Cold statues: quiet there.	27.386237659994276
Safe in a minute.	62.58046109556462
No. Didn ’ t see me.	145.23910767986635
After two.	189.15146414337278
Just at the gate.	452.9864596513663
My heart! His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone.	12.731868824552828
Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.	36.06770015227521
Look for something I.	104.54612045615565
Where did I?	54.972388321321596
Busy looking.	275.55255271992644
He thrust back quick Agendath.	89.50113954577179
Afternoon she said.	98.61957357715396
I am looking for that.	202.66409901330005
Yes, that.	383.63993707211574
Try all pockets.	72.83737266079113
Handker.	1218.4197832253003
Trousers.	724.3403374961829
Potato.	812.0832237234374
Purse.	1218.4197832253003
Where?	2503.021043628515
Hurry.	469.9420631433986
Walk quietly.	110.91760225142121
Moment more.	203.37013858026597
My heart.	124.01919679665517
His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap lotion have to call tepid paper stuck.	54.20961806215879
Ah soap there I yes.	58.01556232696733
Gate.	1218.4197832253003
Safe! Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred: — And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.	61.90592050086867

— All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his shadow.	47.28235346902915

Aristotle was once Plato ’ s schoolboy.	158.36565392003243
— And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said.	245.20278072391838
One can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.	58.01760636334963

Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light.	24.883211289510314
He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.	33.812696802498444
— That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet ’ s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato ’ s.	86.67710293597763
John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth: — Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.	36.52255662112593
— Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?	222.2238686991593

France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer ’ s Phæacians.	43.99605869746684
From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.	39.72876429407581
— Mallarmé, don ’ t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris.	119.72978675877346
The one about <URL> He says: _il se promène, lisant au livre de lui - même_, don ’ t you know, _reading the book of himself_.	15.485829736883503

His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.	35.590218981649244
_Hamlet ou Le Distrait Pièce de Shakespeare_ He repeated to John Eglinton ’ s newgathered frown: — _Pièce de Shakespeare_, don ’ t you know.	28.402198859367893
It ’ s so French.	94.51877528294536
The French point of view.	689.4509118134613
_Hamlet ou_...	65.87117369006555
— The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.	179.82607528347964
John Eglinton laughed.	95.54780917906542
— Yes, I suppose it would be, he said.	305.11587817760784
Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.	100.30282449993602
Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.	29.566217255787716
— A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said.	159.8520653605647
Not for nothing was he a butcher ’ s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms.	38.43821678691514

The devil and the deep sea.	387.97922806788307
— He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best ’ s behoof.	152.4300974464887
Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.	23.84893357288097
List! List! O List! My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.	19.46636218778413
If thou didst ever...	57.99094573679566
— What is a ghost?	1098.8318012537852
Stephen said with tingling energy.	291.2416273178711
One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners.	17.22785561151487
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin.	15.45080412745673
Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_, returning to the world that has forgotten him?	31.10092822771362
Who is King Hamlet?	169.05193248731482
John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.	35.81657054176199
Lifted.	1218.4197832253003

— Shakespeare has left the huguenot ’ s house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank.	79.90771385247268
But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes.	20.47124404002331
The swan of Avon has other thoughts.	52.52869458112032
Composition of place.	140.4819215127848
A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice.	70.62087479765988
It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre.	110.30185693344492
He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name: Hamlet, I am thy father ’ s spirit, bidding him list.	50.89574787191751
To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.	57.040063954374716
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son ’ s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet ’ s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?	35.95785805839544
— But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.	118.85886198242763
Art thou there, truepenny?	60.69593365245652
— Interesting only to the parish clerk.	405.2822450780585
I mean, we have the plays.	263.9539631110248
I mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the poet lived?	64.56181590049418
As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l ’ Isle has said.	19.815710084605627
Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet ’ s drinking, the poet ’ s debts.	280.4657979931804
We have _King Lear_: and it is immortal.	224.17256592927234
Mr Best ’ s face, appealed to, agreed.	57.110638192228876

John Eglinton ’ s carping voice asked.	92.8319320125423
Her ghost at least has been laid for ever.	22.993398556303347
She died, for literature at least, before she was born.	123.42856571044848
— She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born.	47.293659315913054
She saw him into and out of the world.	338.48967885687443
She took his first embraces.	47.72598399805987
She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.	154.47192973903103

_Liliata <URL> I wept alone.	44.14445468537687
John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.	190.9589419621956
— The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.	192.18998845523305
— Bosh! Stephen said rudely.	319.24855077950536
A man of genius makes no mistakes.	58.504801131543445
His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.	40.18372586420172
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.	27.396701799119796
— A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine.	45.19090310769565
What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?	36.12543122297338
— Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world.	153.312363590408
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit nomen! _), Socratididion ’ s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know.	52.450967530046505
But neither the midwife ’ s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.	27.05956503561623
Mr Best ’ s quiet voice said forgetfully.	85.51393394106157
Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.	49.33949480973066
His look went from brooder ’ s beard to carper ’ s skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned.	51.55351504100925
— He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.	251.386483159893
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling _The girl I left behind <URL> If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows.	25.272169987833053
That memory, _Venus and Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light - of - love in London.	21.222844115197162
Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured?	48.64123217506785
Hortensio calls her young and beautiful.	51.72838915983152
Do you think the writer of _Antony and Cleopatra_, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal?	50.47101934186291
Good: he left her and gained the world of men.	65.12676927486083
But his boywomen are the women of a boy.	83.56383520561636
Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males.	22.346587680255087
He chose badly?	434.0700385453178
He was chosen, it seems to me.	51.049437455318284
If others have their will Ann hath a way.	21.723843197487767
By cock, she was to blame.	95.29175198518618
She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix.	48.45789569385391
The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.	21.28542201491958
And my turn?	381.5358769706159
When?	158.680335589764
Come! — Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.	24.76130885895176
He murmured then with blond delight for all: Between the acres of the rye These pretty countryfolk would lie.	33.12600011589441

Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets ’ verses.	26.380991032171956

Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.	31.120011897054486

If he considers it important it will go in.	16.217950038969505

Stephen sat down.	1071.0400485230532
The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers.	99.48154023686196
Blushing, his mask said: — Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.	72.78238234680852
He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low: — Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?	78.88472241106778
Alarmed face asks me.	70.04443863408493
Why did he come?	186.66144575618014
Courtesy or an inward light?	61.45384770553518
— Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.	100.89624693580107
— Yes.	1061.8201792287966
Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.	93.80853098364635
Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully tapsters ’ wives.	29.282477361775843
Fox and geese.	129.53949124709393
And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.	16.920208829292427
— Yes.	1061.8201792287966
So you think...	375.58095645597416
The door closed behind the outgoer.	65.19394260286705
Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.	14.105894473803001
A vestal ’ s lamp.	756.6653392384859
Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.	17.992502985199383
Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.	43.40463405740474
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned.	27.440933634858556

Still: but an itch of death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.	47.051399950980866
— Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic.	60.13499653678589
We know nothing but that he lived and suffered.	112.2495814998741
Not even so much.	346.31804681686896
Others abide our question.	62.24328396438313
A shadow hangs over all the rest.	212.1714683393554
— But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn ’ t it?	72.5042851634813
Mr Best pleaded.	93.70192336056996
I mean, a kind of private paper, don ’ t you know, of his private life.	101.5683332164754
I mean, I don ’ t care a button, don ’ t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...	59.82542371758238
His private papers in the original.	393.30340823091103
_Ta an bad ar an tir.	29.566217255787716

Put beurla on it, littlejohn.	427.8248386260302
Quoth littlejohn Eglinton: — I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.	34.45169692078592
Bear with me.	95.42865522891506
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows.	19.548511060633597
A basilisk.	1047.493585384237
_E quando vede l ’ uomo l ’ attosca_.	21.021681835484426
Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.	211.71486470903417
— As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image.	26.42922802214421
And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth.	48.813485205338885
In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be.	45.47717209950671
So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.	78.6310797382782
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.	30.997254469421357
— Yes, Mr Best said youngly.	171.33603775037784
I feel Hamlet quite young.	324.5053014499262
The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.	56.05055670330276
Has the wrong sow by the lug.	112.97600811634474
He is in my father.	500.3480655822184
— That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.	164.29252924082436
John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.	30.444842857259747
— If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market.	230.2614665290624
The plays of Shakespeare ’ s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.	72.68561640770054
— The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.	155.88871933885176
— There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.	120.90248178943189
Said that.	203.4395094458945
— If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, _ look to see when and how the shadow lifts.	51.98222093607576
What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?	21.57057914529292
Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.	7.387324264306749
— A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.	106.8832003834594
— The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected.	28.545728982726356
The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.	120.86407345044637
Good Bacon: gone musty.	32.96166593954952
Shakespeare Bacon ’ s wild oats.	45.83585406411364
Cypherjugglers going the highroads.	78.3681024747878
Seekers on the great quest.	482.6957767871771
What town, good masters?	179.39007996839345
Mummed in names: A.	136.35496040039897
East of the sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n - og_.	57.97684502530923
Booted the twain and staved.	40.66534266626026
How many miles to Dublin?	47.765970515347846
Three score and ten, sir.	61.50203456847452
Will we be there by candlelight?	38.60521412001064
— Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.	210.25315297278743
— Does he?	1179.9145274584744
What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?	38.34909596322858
— Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, that which was lost.	59.79141556221853
What was lost is given back to him: his daughter ’ s child.	350.8877644496651
_My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this <URL> Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?	23.340349595905522
— The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.	103.74348392410784
_L ’ art d ’ être grand_...	25.2287966441705
— Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?	99.49097241038996
Do you know what you are talking about?	230.20531798120055
Such an appeal will touch him.	29.39332313417148
The images of other males of his blood will repel him.	93.68456249154038
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.	103.57797702112723
— I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public.	140.2674729682193
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw.	64.27337691309182
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris.	21.76930988301676
His articles on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant.	69.69591763139
Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets.	89.18898248956963
The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke.	31.433296665699903
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk ’ s egg, prize of their fray.	31.154426131844616
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords.	62.499167515303846
Dost love, Miriam?	81.31141986099793
Dost love thy man?	45.86835810259025
— That may be too, Stephen said.	128.50713324438362
Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life.	46.370978965075324
Why does he send to one who is a _buonaroba, _ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him?	28.272809524363847
He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written _Romeo and Juliet_.	55.0216980473352
Why?	2421.489910325178
He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down.	39.521041850802796
Assumed dongiovannism will not save him.	39.490051045271976
No later undoing will undo the first undoing.	139.40042173041778
The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding.	58.363903978403975
If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman ’ s invisible weapon.	50.15555583590035
There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself.	141.48173190166094
A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.	31.091765679658376
And in the porches of their ears I pour.	114.71830790621236
— The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear.	62.426213390670654
But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come.	29.670262496653425
The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet ’ s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator.	29.94734519537213
He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.	140.24527078951704
But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed.	70.823741550864
His beaver is up.	223.89507316124886
He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore ’ s rocks or what you will, the sea ’ s voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.	146.44860797583837
— Amen! was responded from the doorway.	88.93444186312962
Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?	102.43768624261293
_Entr ’ acte_.	112.77067707425105
A ribald face, sullen as a dean ’ s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles.	65.29661739120048
My telegram.	183.0162153306878
— You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not?	187.749876578361
he asked of Stephen.	235.08860918382598
Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.	29.683877383281025
They make him welcome.	242.60061514476124
_Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch <URL> Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.	8.739422240267965
He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.	13.210264393374914
He lifts his hands.	727.0033068931018
Veils fall.	275.55255271992644
O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.	30.924396757151772
— Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said.	165.8395815144463
A most instructive discussion.	148.6350640505641
Mr Mulligan, I ’ ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare.	102.54810181261578
All sides of life should be represented.	88.10844456572417
He smiled on all sides equally.	28.5769278335336
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled: — Shakespeare?	117.05732815188749
he said.	401.7011151401686
I seem to know the name.	466.8931789868364
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.	96.17189967827046
— To be sure, he said, remembering brightly.	380.3050527441654
The chap that writes like Synge.	81.34868770270543
Mr Best turned to him.	521.1663041337627
— Haines missed you, he said.	818.646439156259
Did you meet him?	75.92612331695936
He ’ ll see you after at the D.	274.5904907828282
B.	192.1781670529122
C.	213.99259247746502
He ’ s gone to Gill ’ s to buy Hyde ’ s _Lovesongs of Connacht_.	91.09404019676117
— I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said.	550.1008381308611
I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.	100.32089349925634
Vining held that the prince was a woman.	162.41589770718332
Has no - one made him out to be an Irishman?	107.91160789707303
Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues.	33.1581357532705
— The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde ’ s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook.	149.79059883621647

— For Willie Hughes, is it not?	118.54745607474919
the quaker librarian asked.	58.78640860849624
Or Hughie Wills?	479.8030250926742
Mr William Himself.	183.30309235625458
W.	434.0547808005836
H.: who am I?	47.667667632906536
— I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.	226.08342787780234
Of course it ’ s all paradox, don ’ t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it ’ s so typical the way he works it out.	45.943725872461386
It ’ s the very essence of Wilde, don ’ t you know.	55.73989698591023
The light touch.	431.5904733650626
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.	102.71320247834198
Tame essence of Wilde.	93.03778786971948
You ’ re darned witty.	153.22688106081878
Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy ’ s ducats.	32.31771420532737
How much did I spend?	59.251432228552076
O, a few shillings.	524.3412794380141
For a plump of pressmen.	37.985291125208754
Humour wet and dry.	68.45255658689554
Wit.	1218.4197832253003

Naked wheatbellied sin.	88.40530891686868
A snake coils her, fang in ’ s kiss.	113.20039097035304
— Do you think it is only a paradox?	158.4981396397874
the quaker librarian was asking.	42.777202067408666
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.	47.15348267376604
They talked seriously of mocker ’ s seriousness.	179.91635068762665
Buck Mulligan ’ s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile.	39.00753516522424
Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket.	44.84241289738184
His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.	59.43753497246929
— Telegram! he said.	589.9457164125412
Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull! He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully: — _The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing <URL> Signed: Dedalus.	20.215748314249673
Where did you launch it from?	35.607517678180194

No. College Green.	188.97441426120577
Have you drunk the four quid?	38.96602610017395
Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street.	64.91667984201389
O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite! Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue: — It ’ s what I ’ m telling you, mister honey, it ’ s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in.	58.260868708396
’ Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I ’ m thinking, and he limp with leching.	55.28720988573282
And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery ’ s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.	28.36486753216011
He wailed: — And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.	57.55117691260105
Stephen laughed.	1838.2740344316371
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.	53.36136187369612
— The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you.	208.379069415604
He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule.	78.7719281333195
He ’ s out in pampooties to murder you.	105.58909858151466
— Me! Stephen exclaimed.	196.5756172053493
That was your contribution to literature.	88.97413279528564
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.	170.4856858956246
— Murder you! he laughed.	331.68631912069907
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint - André - des - Arts.	8.559145212880635

I met a fool i ’ the forest.	52.529366824005734
— Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.	121.51884846778454
—...	84.74620418301832
in which everyone can find his own.	39.57561928934701
So Mr Justice Madden in his _Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms...	33.52110471945676
Yes?	6334.502046148165
What is it?	679.4579743358286
— There ’ s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card.	239.32410133297557
From the <URL> He wants to see the files of the _Kilkenny People_ for last year.	66.5726607978406
— Certainly, certainly, certainly.	37.67240377342891
Is the gentleman?...	52.91799614605282
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked: — Is he?...	50.69515826140994
O, there! Brisk in a galliard he was off, out.	704.9524263205155
In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.	14.588925914336079
— This gentleman?	899.5505881632185
Kilkenny People? _ To be sure.	182.1941976397415
Good day, sir.	157.79531373757752
_Kilkenny_...	154.09669086417924
We have certainly...	142.7619142834721
A patient silhouette waited, listening.	66.16280053318143
— All the leading provincial...	78.36789225538789
_Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian, _ <NUM>...	24.557232914644214

Please, sir...	193.35418174277197
The door closed.	190.8401007975337
— The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.	97.67188479664887
He jumped up and snatched the card.	130.5832334175718
— What ’ s his name?	619.3018960984754
Bloom.	2255.397063679651
He rattled on: — Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more.	94.56482092278617
I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite.	76.13235163806125
The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer.	35.96248193378884
Every day we must do homage to her.	48.36685519810783
_Life of life, thy lips <URL> Suddenly he turned to Stephen: — He knows you.	98.19262674142351
He knows your old fellow.	61.56035931025766
O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks.	168.32558341576157
His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.	41.889769168064845
Venus Kallipyge.	178.5825216515837
O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the maiden hid_.	41.35440882448228
— We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best ’ s approval.	326.159457496588
We begin to be interested in Mrs S.	132.4973166803405
Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.	70.59347506340819
— Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus ’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope.	31.33512928021761
Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland.	115.45384856815497
His life was rich.	250.43828259689997
His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit.	66.51997811040636
Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies.	7.395473331406339
Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays.	87.07689747153776
The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba.	29.85802953724416
Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.	7.739996146862338
You know Manningham ’ s story of the burgher ’ s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon ’ s blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_.	51.12524460478751
And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.	36.821294636592484
Cours la Reine.	112.77067707425105
_Encore vingt sous.	88.40530891686868
Minette?	1218.4197832253003
Tu veux? _ — The height of fine society.	43.034927673218995
And sir William Davenant of Oxford ’ s mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.	46.87971327214328
Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed: — Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock! — And Harry of six wives ’ daughter.	37.35230771538832
And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings.	17.256481331762107
But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?	34.030658583935804
Do and do.	178.79769546621276
Thing done.	186.38277244620522
In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn.	35.76270201450062
An azured harebell like her veins.	96.66454142126342
Lids of Juno ’ s eyes, violets.	117.92910191213207
He walks.	1094.8476633113119
One life is all.	53.86947573737569
One body.	148.18633923710303
Do. But do.	45.375707029989634
Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.	22.14517319723601
Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton ’ s desk sharply.	79.64719234915847
— Whom do you suspect?	1302.2049509627789
he challenged.	289.0602866898494
— Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets.	301.23697849103235
Once spurned twice spurned.	38.979113575635274
But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.	269.3229804827193
Love that dare not speak its name.	17.987479823318175
— As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.	76.29169269442039
Old wall where sudden lizards flash.	22.817825892679256
— It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion.	124.66365365733428
Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife.	90.95213315422859
But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow.	75.54554403120973
Two deeds are rank in that ghost ’ s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband ’ s brother.	26.100530629952434
Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood.	364.2430630560562
Once a wooer, twice a wooer.	24.05339940043311
Stephen turned boldly in his chair.	76.03290178157303
— The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning.	138.85371130282306
If you deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him.	45.67836740117716
All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan ’ s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy ’ s words, wed her second, having killed her first.	18.443429804546685
O, yes, mention there is.	491.177149846822
In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father ’ s shepherd.	58.61461436525936
Explain you then.	105.25486305033581
Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.	41.50879064078359
He faced their silence.	179.18336570631007
To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.	58.195169959927306
She was entitled to her widow ’ s dower At common law.	147.80481156006215
His legal knowledge was great Our judges tell us.	35.33085892642561
Him Satan fleers, Mocker: And therefore he left out her name From the first draft but he did not leave out The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters, For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford And in London.	25.914330001214473
<URL> Leftherhis Secondbest Leftherhis Bestabed Secabest Leftabed.	22.940896887520857
Woa! — Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.	17.711873364184044
— He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer.	49.05715184755646
Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?	27.77068884137168
— It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.	81.7159024539429
— _Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.	36.51109630969179
— Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.	28.15204401884343
Let me think.	3883.706314761971
— Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don ’ t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.	28.979470059665317
— Do you mean he died so?	234.386117645713
Mr Best asked with slight concern.	26.896750229360403
I mean...	263.8502162069196
— He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped.	219.8139836019325
A quart of ale is a dish for a king.	135.89116255514335
O, I must tell you what Dowden said! — What?	84.27822391476404
asked Besteglinton.	120.8946647122669
William Shakespeare and company, limited.	42.13091663929499
The people ’ s William.	1094.2712044931131
Dowden, Highfield house...	64.63653309675047
— Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously.	152.89768421545094
I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard.	46.734680627633466
He lifted his hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those <URL> Lovely! Catamite.	22.318611004864284
— The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton.	33.881885891137046
Steadfast John replied severe: — The doctor can tell us what those words mean.	28.903704826460103
You cannot eat your cake and have it.	61.63541889071591
Sayest thou so?	112.77067707425105
Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?	161.72485647508265
— And the sense of property, Stephen said.	54.39444420321071
He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket.	88.59000469944172
The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots.	47.52186239722545
His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.	11.881559862815234
He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent.	25.40931726142386
How else could Aubrey ’ s ostler and callboy get rich quick?	44.24265273887447
All events brought grist to his mill.	44.44878018635305
Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen ’ s leech Lopez, his jew ’ s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting.	34.48592284668101
The lost armada is his jeer in _Love ’ s Labour Lost_.	71.85691769172662
His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm.	53.562588757341906
Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter ’ s theory of equivocation.	84.95519049717406
The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin.	24.755297147667722
The sugared sonnets follow Sidney ’ s.	144.8378183556062
As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.	23.84974638726384
I think you ’ re getting on very nicely.	124.17246487651623
Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological.	38.506797878619025
_Mingo, minxi, mictum, <URL> — Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly.	47.51855914144872
Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.	58.20329755802652
_Sufflaminandus <URL> — He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals.	42.66827563749231
— A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded.	155.02236340623085
Coleridge called him myriadminded.	96.28063117688407
_Amplius.	644.5508818121558
In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter <URL> — Saint Thomas, Stephen began...	30.626818328697837
— _Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.	55.58906206168116
There he keened a wailing rune.	30.98163459442165
— _Pogue mahone! Acushla machree! _ It ’ s destroyed we are from this day! It ’ s destroyed we are surely! All smiled their smiles.	50.91381600128157
— Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions.	42.012369569139935
He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it.	27.86256067603707
Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage.	57.026789062959345
Accusations are made in anger.	65.87220318207143
The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel.	42.82926551752673
Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet.	28.875353624377034
But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife.	9.66216263186036

Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what ’ s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow.	31.42421976678608

The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first.	47.04898524427125
Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare ’ s reverence, the angel of the world.	90.88287931780539
Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney ’ s _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?	56.111133144619345

He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.	60.84273790109547
— Why?	4038.772848964433
Stephen answered himself.	1835.6991336540034
Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him.	35.29774802984576
The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book.	13.629326072107027
It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.	31.009200216208594
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.	30.66228741766581
But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil.	21.606651788302916
The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth.	46.62354621980062
An original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.	24.84189876388613
It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid.	73.25728586999962
Age has not withered it.	61.73090029891903
Beauty and peace have not done it away.	10.001066611341333
It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_, twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet, _ in _Measure for Measure_ — and in all the other plays which I have not read.	64.39812314036658
He laughed to free his mind from his mind ’ s bondage.	119.22208359254955
Judge Eglinton summed up.	53.46091734949672
— The truth is midway, he affirmed.	254.79256815449116
He is the ghost and the prince.	473.58277980623365

When all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?) _ is right.	59.38925584450265
After God Shakespeare has created most.	30.659939139934984
— Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said.	36.9588155577342
He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth.	87.35394260200417

Gravediggers bury Hamlet _père_ and Hamlet <URL> A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music.	20.50574295267545
And, what though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced.	19.551269610486386
If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa ’ s lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go.	63.87734932860317

We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers - in - love, but always meeting ourselves.	21.423721755899916
The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.	28.641747843913386
_ — Eureka! _ Buck Mulligan cried.	97.79148239895108
_Eureka! _ Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton ’ s desk.	62.32753174058622
— May I?	925.1320164119627
he said.	401.7011151401686
The Lord has spoken to Malachi.	85.57796575014625
He began to scribble on a slip of paper.	20.035740676435903
Take some slips from the counter going out.	90.78327649712173
— Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall live.	106.15839024536862
The rest shall keep as they are.	60.08530312090113
He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.	30.71043895205688
Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his variorum edition of _The Taming of the <URL> — You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen.	16.87167128341923
You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle.	57.352274348662945
Do you believe your own theory?	130.16679175729337
— No, Stephen said promptly.	587.1631144813011
— Are you going to write it?	72.12515450172795
Mr Best asked.	73.45657307122228
You ought to make it a dialogue, don ’ t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.	48.222131315739546
John Eclecticon doubly smiled.	67.51333659628736
— Well, in that case, he said, I don ’ t see why you should expect payment for it since you don ’ t believe it yourself.	128.34276933876646

— For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.	82.4894064527652
Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice: — I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.	69.07247110076014
He broke away.	396.80693662354486
— Come, Kinch.	186.48288335268282
Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.	108.28738146237632
Come, Kinch.	49.44698356506319
You have eaten all we left.	68.18740734657301
Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.	45.21053120809862
Stephen rose.	1838.2740344316371
Life is many days.	37.42181594780639
This will end.	105.29452784239275

_Notre ami_ Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.	31.8505079653749
Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.	27.00877508144102

Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.	33.95633424738351
What have I learned?	182.56304315274667

Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling: John Eglinton, my jo, John, Why won ’ t you wed a wife?	18.415326404453104
He spluttered to the air: — O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton.	109.70653541473787

M ’ Curdy Atkinson, The same that had the wooden leg And that filibustering filibeg That never dared to slake his drouth, Magee that had the chinless mouth.	22.23359776588559
Jest on.	275.40956118521854
Know thyself.	136.56845913884007
Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me.	70.10119015349669
I halt.	1365.6383391264305
— Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned.	162.06351896912275
Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature.	36.5731142409401
Only crows, priests and English coal are black.	14.98297085702324
A laugh tripped over his lips.	94.26448604519358
— Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory.	129.24795904317997
O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.	44.494199729753184
Couldn ’ t you do the Yeats touch?	265.9210619748701
He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms: — The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.	38.43681389094502
One thinks of Homer.	91.19140350033749
He stopped at the stairfoot.	678.9426302957905
The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined.	58.15836176231625
Gone the nine men ’ s morrice with caps of indices.	52.42283190437331
In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: _Everyman His Own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky <URL> He turned a happy patch ’ s smirk to Stephen, saying: — The disguise, I fear, is thin.	27.977889365542573
But listen.	1531.358787276848
He read, _marcato: _ — Characters: TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole) CRAB (a bushranger) MEDICAL DICK) and) (two birds with one stone) MEDICAL DAVY) MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier) FRESH NELLY and ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).	8.77703818344791
He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men: — O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit! — The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.	42.46103626821385
About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.	102.72382284855439
Part.	888.3498927094821
The moment is now.	186.98979994928305
Where then?	1865.8567304597657
If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight.	25.079978809002636
Why?	2421.489910325178
That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.	33.96192403146733
My will: his will that fronts me.	27.12461162223313
Seas between.	275.29382542023205
A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.	66.85058227295471
— Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.	542.9328552188737
The portico.	1473.6388010057888
Here I watched the birds for augury.	36.11692679301496

— The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown ’ s awe.	100.58891973266176
Did you see his eye?	154.702086924615
He looked upon you to lust after you.	55.42139193961944
I fear thee, ancient mariner.	112.96607429330398

A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.	74.83750088675924
They followed.	874.7056601231313
Speak on.	186.4611292808216
Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street.	15.011654782190837
No birds.	1344.0689515154133
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.	19.27708411311247

reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps.	82.70754291846197
Five to three.	69.80566128512014
Just nice time to walk to Artane.	43.144042632322034
What was that boy ’ s name again?	136.18137315741367
Dignam.	240.86349921391303
Yes.	1763.135277433406
_Vere dignum et iustum <URL> Brother Swan was the person to see.	33.19210514037367
Mr Cunningham ’ s letter.	66.6427615593842

Oblige him, if possible.	652.3239828793453
Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.	16.33839307074319
A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes.	28.04147608662832
He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S.	28.175164442829097
J.	129.7375304578709
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.	230.19642535323004
Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square.	38.60461274708386
He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey ’ s words: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old <URL> He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. — Very well, indeed, father.	27.741621563259077
And you, father?	358.51273383260747
Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed.	24.135902070651415
He would go to Buxton probably for the waters.	231.618733689962
And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere?	39.69229475322954
Was that so?	448.31823721471875
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.	16.35416723382995
And Mr Sheehy himself?	143.01835733703174
Still in London.	107.55924427610152
The house was still sitting, to be sure it was.	102.64052744733957
Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed.	42.070386623811785
Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach.	34.9324949323013
O, yes: a very great success.	48.91952934021787
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Yes, he would certainly call.	25.16911870830889
— Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.	257.5229226496524
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun.	41.93669238275831
He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.	226.10892828711218
Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s droll eyes and cockney voice.	35.66620152296893
— Pilate! Wy don ’ t you old back that owlin mob?	69.02854160666976
A zealous man, however.	305.802615193874
Really he was.	439.3043275714749
And really did great good in his way.	52.306357685232555
Beyond a doubt.	83.66874072636239
He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.	1001.8090426877523
Of good family too would one think it?	28.520553976264498
Welsh, were they not?	85.22910893291038
O, lest he forget.	142.3550224271193
That letter to father provincial.	50.02710825169928
Yes: they were from Belvedere.	42.39872184104073
The little house.	747.1852424953536
Aha.	314.7935622734734
And were they good boys at school?	62.74317740177869
O.	1594.4374175036246
That was very good now.	278.86716203259374
And what was his name?	1535.3221185175462
Jack Sohan.	178.5825216515837
And his name?	900.2663638638545
Ger.	1218.4197832253003
Gallaher.	812.0832237234374
And the other little man?	224.98902489375365
His name was Brunny Lynam.	122.39624076220103
O, that was a very nice name to have.	185.10490557747903
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.	48.071434363464384
— But mind you don ’ t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.	208.2784002185221
The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed: — O, sir.	135.2269814567623
— Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.	138.5152258091449
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee ’ s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.	47.806092644164714
Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.	18.798377594699442
Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam ’ s court.	19.862388510501443
Was that not Mrs M ’ Guinness?	207.16675260085168
Mrs M ’ Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed.	24.163320991278603
And Father Conmee smiled and saluted.	107.02985661094318
A fine carriage she had.	156.89472645513757
Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.	39.85768332587612
And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a...	69.72658864913423
what should he say?...	45.39781852457939
such a queenly mien.	126.57824043492712
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left.	48.14406631302697
The reverend T.	46.2904577036971
R.	192.92825118471487
Greene <URL>. will (<URL>.) speak.	133.2641471563254
The incumbent they called him.	137.38648992075707
He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words.	285.87733458035154
But one should be charitable.	158.74212113633126
Invincible ignorance.	275.29382542023205
They acted according to their lights.	196.03241607746256
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road.	20.17551168139409
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare.	46.96879113165002
Surely, there ought to be.	233.48242854163797
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.	31.60280169472036
All raised untidy caps.	49.43829328058058
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.	20.0864450157667
Christian brother boys.	112.77067707425105
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.	36.368816516970085
Saint Joseph ’ s church, Portland row.	62.62150850339169
For aged and virtuous females.	39.968070535139425
Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.	179.2616749414748
Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.	48.20669731785796
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman.	43.38042408469032
And now it was an office or something.	68.60255865373371
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.	38.86806054194442
Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.	9.8835085312724
He passed Grogan ’ s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York.	26.653005821016063
In America those things were continually happening.	61.714782405218685
Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.	101.0440465984574
Still, an act of perfect contrition.	41.05969418449566
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin ’ s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged.	47.02905599963926
They saluted him and were saluted.	430.19644526817535
Father Conmee passed H.	52.77401510893686
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Neill ’ s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.	50.46279592895458
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable.	97.6426336994629
In Youkstetter ’ s, the porkbutcher ’ s, Father Conmee observed pig ’ s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.	82.48406198774569
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him.	13.518415348548741
It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.	74.31015480495763
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.	42.74614771705186
J.	129.7375304578709
of saint Francis Xavier ’ s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.	27.763600716421212
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C.	15.798686981606531
C.	213.99259247746502
of saint Agatha ’ s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.	53.76548205376621
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.	19.3439101521555
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.	26.37270160723451
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket.	18.121049895392915
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap.	128.38042540998683
Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.	35.18636522788649
It was a peaceful day.	151.75187884875453
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down.	42.983138727313744
His wife, Father Conmee supposed.	212.14666589019137
A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses.	113.66993346968667
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.	12.582024433644836
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car.	111.09915584535617
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.	79.29284369932458
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight.	40.49394210355265
The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her.	58.13998434336724
She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you, my child, _ that they have been absolved, _pray for <URL> But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.	32.99052776977354
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.	14.149589588750404
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.	32.95824035534221
J.	129.7375304578709
and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night.	68.38098893017343
That book by the Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus, _ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea.	22.322232329444947
Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (<URL>.) been brought.	24.905075755274204
But they were God ’ s souls, created by God.	137.75453662935934
It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.	22.18459640802182
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.	65.80105367356794
The Malahide road was quiet.	106.06307025926907
It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.	29.75179799667517
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide.	52.52869458112032
Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.	17.807679797931858
Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.	56.923873757654306
Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.	59.23617953756639
Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.	30.487214080747595
A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged.	36.65388055186272
Who could know the truth?	157.04117150179317
Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, _ with her husband ’ s brother?	24.1181438598176
She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did.	31.526300275902624
Only God knew and she and he, her husband ’ s brother.	191.9156451365515
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man ’ s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.	47.932968667706824
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore.	71.97798803819539
He was humane and honoured there.	67.7503708897788
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.	43.209981969440804
It was a charming day.	160.80145383178845
The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves.	74.37482822850448
The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind.	42.30167029593524
_Moutonner, _ the French said.	66.16698022596042
A just and homely word.	96.35185795344294
Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey.	12.68210662840419
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field.	64.47639658256972
He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys ’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening.	153.356376894641
He was their rector: his reign was mild.	38.74888195340125
Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.	33.20764426714201
An ivory bookmark told him the page.	134.9320988384135
Nones.	1218.4197832253003
He should have read that before lunch.	94.59680780458024
But lady Maxwell had come.	122.08677001702542
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.	15.277164995330716
_Deus in <URL> He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ <URL> A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand.	16.16920344688034
The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	26.180112451830063
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary.	35.23125893438902
_Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor <URL> * * * Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner.	12.263217284694468
He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings.	28.825887283319695
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway.	30.72449960722431
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.	40.358083405443196
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.	114.4084539228829
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.	34.39000402661861
Constable <NUM> C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.	52.929147759146
— That ’ s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.	517.9077399887159
— Ay, Corny Kelleher said.	143.92588691332756
— It ’ s very close, the constable said.	263.88770544341304
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.	12.247076661696678
— What ’ s the best news?	152.60144329748246
he asked.	72.62503664047722
— I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.	97.11799755640476
Towards Larry O ’ Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably: — _For England_...	97.7637584049169
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled: — _home and <URL> J.	26.66396404402369
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy ’ s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.	113.87110900251727
A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her.	41.45015463584043
The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.	16.313455341168122
He halted and growled angrily: — _For England_...	53.58690250394207
Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.	23.077008807376423
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply: — _home and <URL> The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.	20.451197102105343
The blind of the window was drawn aside.	187.69399066966002
A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps.	25.789315471250337
A woman ’ s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.	31.334612383721733
It fell on the path.	227.9264458765668
One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel ’ s cap, saying: — There, sir.	225.82184323877988
* * * Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.	84.2464985107452
— Did you put in the books?	572.7519221706182
Boody asked.	10.003850199046777
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.	21.172003849742456
— They wouldn ’ t give anything on them, she said.	204.76270828287286
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.	30.90842181803756
— Where did you try?	319.95288741031294
Boody asked.	10.003850199046777
— M ’ Guinness ’ s.	1465.873211243497
Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.	24.896615510120238
— Bad cess to her big face! she cried.	252.36666049535225
Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.	51.747671449469884
— What ’ s in the pot?	967.4557090653868
she asked.	394.3789053786724
— Shirts, Maggy said.	185.95974365416228
Boody cried angrily: — Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?	62.481367776473455
Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked: — And what ’ s in this?	62.3710190294913
A heavy fume gushed in answer.	65.18410062962073
— Peasoup, Maggy said.	185.95974365416228
Katey asked.	217.21349569404808
— Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.	85.04075446292897
The lacquey rang his bell.	18.667195029610713
— Barang! Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily: — Give us it here.	111.83988256473933
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl.	35.13540918194717
Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs: — A good job we have that much.	59.808100701630856
Where ’ s Dilly?	1353.1775380786164
— Gone to meet father, Maggy said.	98.42731077436113
Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added: — Our father who art not in heaven.	26.688563199879553
Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey ’ s bowl, exclaimed: — Boody! For shame! A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George ’ s quay.	17.898340074409564
* * * The blond girl in Thornton ’ s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre.	23.694342902061138
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.	24.042209757013936
— Put these in first, will you?	71.53358085257466
he said.	401.7011151401686
— Yes, sir, the blond girl said.	280.8438448246935
And the fruit on top.	128.0028280930331
— That ’ ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.	125.25230998809212
She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.	46.995631350872664
Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.	19.13364395608296
H.	194.40360032537305
E.	189.06299250251155
L.	195.29848232727008
Y. ’ S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.	22.036775503810375
He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain ’ s length.	49.77022560669586
— Can you send them by tram?	130.87769524891496
Now?	7794.835527339192
A darkbacked figure under Merchants ’ arch scanned books on the hawker ’ s cart.	79.78479538129844
— Certainly, sir.	132.11822538696453
Is it in the city?	200.7960835332991
— O, yes, Blazes Boylan said.	481.6111100214993
Ten minutes.	2499.7967995620606
The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.	55.70057309994136
— Will you write the address, sir?	126.12680068545343
Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.	71.17457086628086
— Send it at once, will you?	471.7580526908862
he said.	401.7011151401686
It ’ s for an invalid.	125.58849791589797
— Yes, sir.	581.7927155315168
I will, sir.	1128.0150539096146
Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers ’ pocket.	48.563487795716576
— What ’ s the damage?	410.01051506261604
he asked.	72.62503664047722
The blond girl ’ s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.	104.24599337392286
Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse.	103.33453141491931
A young pullet.	240.41831366137927
He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.	61.85432583087549
he asked gallantly.	117.29881330874358
The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.	58.599553232019176
— Yes, sir, she said.	394.8414800754763
Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.	15.774921041645824
Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.	47.57239842309577
— May I say a word to your telephone, missy?	91.60908656048805
he asked roguishly.	117.29881330874358
* * * _ — Ma! _ Almidano Artifoni said.	49.382160551641284
He gazed over Stephen ’ s shoulder at Goldsmith ’ s knobby poll.	62.491028788562076
Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests.	13.947242783184958
Palefaces.	812.0832237234374
Men ’ s arms frankly round their stunted forms.	23.28050847608382
They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.	71.81294620078766
— _Anch ’ io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand ’ ero giovine come Lei.	26.303107620212558
Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.	14.889542755791435
È peccato.	275.29382542023205
Perchè la sua voce...	35.93717766862271
sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.	23.074325705284153
_ — Speriamo, _ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly.	19.100253573459884
_Ma, dia retta a me.	27.75909846082272
Ci rifletta_.	275.29382542023205
By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.	20.102207223916526
— _Ci rifletterò, _ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.	193.81091069598236
— _Ma, sul serio, eh? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	47.803190522691786
His heavy hand took Stephen ’ s firmly.	171.3809672625595
Human eyes.	207.92272851420728
They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.	28.67568201720077
_ — Eccolo, _ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste.	30.899841710991435
_Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi.	29.566217255787716
Addio, <URL> — _Arrivederla, maestro, _ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed.	57.9857515610568
_E <URL> — _Di che? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	21.53880019935681
_Scusi, eh?	129.61284589109073
In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.	12.571929495234945
* * * Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_ far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.	14.47421594451955
Too much mystery business in it.	57.01324580850568
Is he in love with that one, Marion?	38.68461679151114
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.	21.67038301372917
The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.	26.860711760708366
Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard: — <NUM> June <NUM>.	441.22327038080476
Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny ’ s corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone ’ s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H.	41.3748150984536
E.	189.06299250251155
L.	195.29848232727008
Y. ’ S and plodded back as they had come.	27.601043007517458
Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses.	42.13935049502502
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks.	69.88364190194757
She ’ s not nicelooking, is she?	190.42690828390198
The way she ’ s holding up her bit of a skirt.	127.15312033865565
Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight.	102.34995129246956
If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle ’ s.	39.800495841371465
They kick out grand.	174.35461434542813
Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.	94.38994990384275
Hope to goodness he won ’ t keep me here till seven.	42.2425888489234
— Hello.	3945.9437599779303
Yes, sir.	733.512678382765
No, sir.	495.2586711446354
Yes, sir.	733.512678382765
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	82.35182866724271
Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool.	172.30108175692723
All right, sir.	171.03877942226237
Then I can go after six if you ’ re not back.	219.27898564554445
A quarter after.	377.29939449047663
Yes, sir.	733.512678382765
Twentyseven and six.	113.19205193804834
I ’ ll tell him.	251.73478636286686
Yes: one, seven, six.	34.349438860197644
She scribbled three figures on an envelope.	65.83985750227596
— Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.	57.95501341925079
Mr Lenehan, yes.	439.72478876057323
He said he ’ ll be in the Ormond at four.	136.49070990468172
No, sir.	495.2586711446354
Yes, sir.	733.512678382765
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	82.35182866724271
* * * Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.	79.82801138044285
— Who ’ s that?	542.5220985667119
Ned Lambert asked.	308.59016177481374
Is that Crotty?	637.447096873385
— Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.	59.596714000187504
— Hello, Jack, is that yourself?	162.12464761625793
Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches.	48.02613194340839
Come on.	162.8815627186843
Mind your steps there.	52.40070659076293
The vesta in the clergyman ’ s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall.	97.40732461817367
At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.	22.291406154157173
— How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.	108.07150413308452
— Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily.	288.1088903404359
We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary ’ s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in <NUM>.	60.183879383524115
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.	30.28750669366467
The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews ’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road.	43.74306011924653
You were never here before, Jack, were you?	54.47472952009216
— No, Ned.	1526.3614870252209
— He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me.	82.38289872668918
— That ’ s right, Ned Lambert said.	221.84426732499924
That ’ s quite right, sir.	52.139653512849534
— If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...	274.54036849110344
— Certainly, Ned Lambert said.	77.48169882329532
Bring the camera whenever you like.	78.24965373001376
I ’ ll get those bags cleared away from the windows.	65.0160925509948
You can take it from here or from here.	77.3673294549653
In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.	20.577390062327385
From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.	19.88574617964887
— I ’ m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said.	264.97871688839473
I won ’ t trespass on your valuable time...	140.45120127743542
— You ’ re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said.	155.01757876452834
Drop in whenever you like.	143.0219617459424
Next week, say.	55.97732429805328
Can you see?	111.77550618954709
— Yes, yes.	689.9852840581676
Good afternoon, Mr Lambert.	176.33458998839788
Very pleased to have met you.	72.3727403120304
— Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.	323.79224509050465
He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars.	80.72457455943321
With J.	1664.6551156364671
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary ’ s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O ’ Connor, Wexford.	28.26940701052908
He stood to read the card in his hand.	176.29792879652956
— The reverend Hugh C.	136.803690212064
Present address: Saint Michael ’ s, Sallins.	64.41290919745113
Nice young chap he is.	28.464609946867544
He ’ s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me.	132.13646752785726
He ’ s well up in history, faith.	57.16758854095948
The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	16.357091713102623
— I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.	185.60091169335578
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Molloy said.	423.98501972007375
Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.	200.53565485404542
— God! he cried.	180.19543211376663
I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.	56.36970785716769
You know that one?	386.5167596313757
_I ’ m bloody sorry I did it, _ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was <URL> He mightn ’ t like it, though.	57.168541710055266
What?	1560.489681896445
God, I ’ ll tell him anyhow.	313.10178858760423
That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor.	174.75987340070571
Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.	84.49309087178491
The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness.	35.97134597856535
He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried: — Woa, sonny! He turned to J.	90.66249566640842
O ’ Molloy and asked: — Well, Jack.	429.6422657761836
What is it?	679.4579743358286
What ’ s the trouble?	476.55336645838173
Wait awhile.	188.29211966703014
Hold hard.	79.39786985585587
With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.	37.254161509849176
— Chow! he said.	556.7447852681023
Blast you! — The dust from those sacks, J.	24.639025834240815
J.	129.7375304578709
— No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a...	394.3563222400414
cold night before...	132.60622400012917
blast your soul...	89.73158497905828
night before last...	146.76083883101936
and there was a hell of a lot of draught...	65.2170361278995
He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...	197.29921940485337
— I was...	806.7057334725424
Glasnevin this morning...	118.74457199672617
poor little...	164.83008439702624
what do you call him...	375.2703086952292
Chow!...	90.56601719400734
Mother of Moses! * * * Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.	12.940982080909416
— See?	136.74483998036513
he said.	401.7011151401686
Say it ’ s turn six.	128.4606394436149
In here, see.	538.1661740513015
Turn Now On. He slid it into the left slot for them.	16.807050793763974
It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.	21.76662731587199
Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king ’ s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.	13.493920780293498
— See?	136.74483998036513
See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.	55.086774797101796
The impact.	1473.6388010057888
Leverage, see?	113.59695665289006
He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.	57.134116612970864
— Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	179.87504315060187
So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.	59.328693711986496
— See?	136.74483998036513
Tom Rochford said.	47.92643406214817
He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four.	23.804496139809668
Turn Now On. — I ’ ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him.	73.55999912760612
One good turn deserves another.	41.40360435702389
— Do, Tom Rochford said.	169.05036499070238
Tell him I ’ m Boylan with impatience.	114.74720466464544
— Goodnight, M ’ Coy said abruptly.	527.7526194658184
When you two begin...	69.23505979269264
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.	25.20836663934628
— But how does it work here, Tommy?	100.58393039761705
he asked.	72.62503664047722
— Tooraloo, Lenehan said.	602.3310682037833
See you later.	677.9050190241076
— He ’ s a hero, he said simply.	919.7924378647431
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	401.51988710967885
The drain, you mean.	236.8172678256987
— Drain?	3933.1036573861734
Lenehan said.	706.6023639221655
It was down a manhole.	212.01085042458485
They passed Dan Lowry ’ s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.	24.843172356518256
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M ’ Coy how the whole thing was.	47.10626775248019
One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas.	59.3332575337235
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky ’ s vest and all, with the rope round him.	38.26969137486475
And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.	55.23714735085337
— The act of a hero, he said.	290.63574338868995
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.	13.835067091848803
— This way, he said, walking to the right.	789.0062311234233
I want to pop into Lynam ’ s to see Sceptre ’ s starting price.	196.39987629935237
What ’ s the time by your gold watch and chain?	150.26452040191836
M ’ Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses ’ sombre office, then at O ’ Neill ’ s clock.	96.41179238994903
— After three, he said.	699.0005811885785
Who ’ s riding her?	528.0830039403843
— O.	3939.829170151001
Madden, Lenehan said.	37.586446639533044
While he waited in Temple bar M ’ Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter.	56.48439119074735
Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.	13.77454860504744
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.	169.39563979559475
— Even money, Lenehan said returning.	463.6819287927821
I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn ’ t an earthly.	90.62088219431031
Through here.	159.31600516752437
They went up the steps and under Merchants ’ arch.	236.31525551157728
— There he is, Lenehan said.	176.79649611679824
— Wonder what he ’ s buying, M ’ Coy said, glancing behind.	495.70686584401284
— _Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, _ Lenehan said.	219.63058088329666
— He ’ s dead nuts on sales, M ’ Coy said.	194.86171102833526
I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob.	88.39532654014917
There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails.	41.242390291131116
Astronomy it was about.	253.82142450938343
Lenehan laughed.	179.94373900567712
— I ’ ll tell you a damn good one about comets ’ tails, he said.	113.06669543794706
Come over in the sun.	243.9122325521464
They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.	119.15012327320265
Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.	32.723976510400625
— There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly.	117.91864901820645
The annual dinner, you know.	96.540819635719
Boiled shirt affair.	112.77067707425105
The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music.	69.20236814324771
Bartell d ’ Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...	33.720115629083146
— I know, M ’ Coy broke in.	440.32292513373363
My missus sang there once.	36.28303634213752
— Did she?	1015.4661347328697
Lenehan said.	706.6023639221655
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number <NUM> Eccles street.	52.21273944662784
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.	48.58247323721242
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	211.76335640899921
Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher.	14.633857249128598
Bloom and the wife were there.	576.0102809066591
Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice.	14.463748428962976
Fast and furious it was.	62.99205248861182
After liquids came solids.	48.43264163843499
Cold joints galore and mince pies...	15.013879304346233
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	401.51988710967885
The year the missus was there...	74.02837481657579
Lenehan linked his arm warmly.	57.733278037326095
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	211.76335640899921
We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o ’ clock the morning after the night before.	34.27024319868742
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter ’ s night on the Featherbed Mountain.	90.93187657197143
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other.	215.75397054387116
We started singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_.	41.33580723342245
She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt ’ s port under her bellyband.	85.75481164860135
Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me.	24.13706497492977
Hell ’ s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her.	44.14066724549601
Like that.	83.58182237834879
He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning: — I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.	64.90830833670324
He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.	105.39034145611386
— The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.	58.56596141593267
She ’ s a gamey mare and no mistake.	85.83826349591114
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot.	147.43376355427938
But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way.	184.778968611965
He knows them all, faith.	124.70212523674593
_And what star is that, Poldy? _ says she.	39.61900853901276
By God, she had Bloom cornered.	270.83106633377014
_That one, is it? _ says Chris Callinan, _sure that ’ s only what you might call a <URL> By God, he wasn ’ t far wide of the mark.	46.66245558283787
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.	94.9024349630149
— I ’ m weak, he gasped.	625.3368148086988
M ’ Coy ’ s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.	229.07373530171932
Lenehan walked on again.	66.18417166516471
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly.	26.64564252213463
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M ’ Coy.	182.2931041262149
— He ’ s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously.	671.8171544997509
He ’ s not one of your common or garden...	97.75013987703221
you know...	226.60344343010203
There ’ s a touch of the artist about old Bloom.	120.69989151040672
* * * Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk_, then of Aristotle ’ s <URL> Crooked botched print.	33.43574363310467
Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows.	13.364286088622036
Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world.	101.91949285620109
All butting with their skulls to get out of it.	124.73931265597014
Child born every minute somewhere.	41.66009560005196
Mrs Purefoy.	273.73149472108037
He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.	51.627005032048
— That I had, he said, pushing it by.	580.4563113252942
The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.	73.92562706236205
— Them are two good ones, he said.	195.29079275231837
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.	233.4403301313871
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.	25.80165809795681
On O ’ Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c.	20.334520285428216
Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles.	170.4707527848508
_Fair Tyrants_ by James Lovebirch.	51.17729107297883
Know the kind that is.	89.54095445924197
Had it?	180.4787252607487
Yes.	1763.135277433406
He opened it.	340.5265875255203
Thought so.	74.98982391950221
A woman ’ s voice behind the dingy curtain.	38.122699381874774
Listen: the man.	495.80997571532356
Got her it once.	44.966206757305784
He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_.	24.63458109755971
More in her line.	127.57999610170219
Let us see.	294.0507068466696
He read where his finger opened.	28.785441206296376
For him! For Raoul! _ Yes.	113.41638538356271
This.	574.9188693373202
Here.	216.12647889293197
Try.	587.2861934342945
— _Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her <URL> Yes.	60.636357841420185
Take this.	146.22828202003154
The end.	1203.002584616646
— You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.	91.91059555232778
The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint.	15.20803478463191
An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.	125.30815269017984
Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful <URL> Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh.	34.39910313170082
Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up.	11.616717712209034
His nostrils arched themselves for prey.	70.66702412145057
Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul! _).	14.781899429831059
Armpits ’ oniony sweat.	62.200804154614865
Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint! _).	18.371897587873896
Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions! Young! Young! An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king ’ s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor ’ s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.	30.377953026367894
Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains.	54.902264536591716
The shopman ’ s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing.	70.8597700471295
He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor.	50.34660470366619
He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.	44.973399176313784
Mr Bloom beheld it.	208.2519966992482
Mastering his troubled breath, he said: — I ’ ll take this one.	146.81625688847598
The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.	36.381715319981545
— _Sweets of Sin, _ he said, tapping on it.	241.70141817879417
That ’ s a good one.	50.16041804704975
Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within.	107.91553907609558
Four and nine.	58.3956912551664
Those lovely curtains.	80.35194480298127
Five shillings.	151.30623107482486
Cosy curtains.	203.07158957055697
Selling new at two guineas.	39.66781863506632
Any advance on five shillings?	39.790960083488926
Going for five shillings.	44.71573802928375
The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it: — Barang! Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.	25.193150857420843
J.	129.7375304578709
A.	14508.205342004916
Jackson, W.	88.7779109347573

Munro and H.	113.37967167452112
T.	195.08478254618373
Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.	36.250302323136665
Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams ’ s row.	39.37154335964972
He halted near his daughter.	89.18569481775151
— It ’ s time for you, she said.	676.9992330004775
— Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.	377.7324262570523
Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?	41.64115995967187
Melancholy God! Dilly shrugged her shoulders.	32.546554708252515
Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.	83.16725791668645
— Stand up straight, girl, he said.	173.50997216344194
You ’ ll get curvature of the spine.	361.28361061393167
Do you know what you look like?	101.8983604198721
He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.	29.260495366223328
— Give it up, father, Dilly said.	58.494427866469124
All the people are looking at you.	28.95866981100537
Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.	23.11998314890946
— Did you get any money?	158.99555935852814
Dilly asked.	13.64610561238065
— Where would I get money?	175.07019087046675
Mr Dedalus said.	49.31984549386607
There is no - one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.	68.17732002935412
— You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.	325.61892968595583
— How do you know that?	88.4724055337047
Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.	584.4044436048125
Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James ’ s street.	36.91985521212934
— I know you did, Dilly answered.	238.8191529740338
Were you in the Scotch house now?	256.36228515648594
Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy?	32.159993981139095
Here.	216.12647889293197
— See if you can do anything with that, he said.	67.17540759506635
— I suppose you got five, Dilly said.	354.67481488501875
Give me more than that.	261.193312741646
— Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly.	288.4485734364374
You ’ re like the rest of them, are you?	46.05192544430274
An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died.	32.84053054137991
But wait awhile.	407.3483414931638
You ’ ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me.	78.89659353482917
Low blackguardism! I ’ m going to get rid of you.	149.61104375556476
Wouldn ’ t care if I was stretched out stiff.	56.85112857760361
He ’ s dead.	692.3596475801354
The man upstairs is dead.	80.25918378531952
He left her and walked on.	116.1993545438099
Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.	8.516456511750878
— Well, what is it?	239.98244776100438
he said, stopping.	1078.273686351296
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.	11.759716772362806
— Barang! — Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.	80.13809891541646
The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly: — Bang! Mr Dedalus stared at him.	26.338161864244974
— Watch him, he said.	2067.701024691758
It ’ s instructive.	317.42468549180893
— You got more than that, father, Dilly said.	119.60021375544046
— I ’ m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said.	143.0855020757577
I ’ ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews.	68.79262077484498
Look, there ’ s all I have.	324.9040666366607
I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.	96.6514662037364
He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.	31.858992524279397
— Can ’ t you look for some money somewhere?	228.02696794357294
Dilly said.	13.824295802692895
Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.	59.68595347956372
— I will, he said gravely.	3138.311661974949
I looked all along the gutter in O ’ Connell street.	56.81646437782418
I ’ ll try this one now.	134.1361473290818
— You ’ re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.	126.68473049126202
— Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies.	191.26246367076993
Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something.	28.30486333716445
I ’ ll be home shortly.	149.9864580924164
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.	61.670141049013964
The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.	37.79297150914835
— I ’ m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.	61.22022325262133
The lacquey banged loudly.	53.90613309602633
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently: — The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn ’ t do anything! O, sure they wouldn ’ t really! Is it little sister Monica! * * * From the sundial towards James ’ s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James ’ s street, past Shackleton ’ s offices.	24.385363790103657
Got round him all right.	138.07618305794287
How do you do, Mr Crimmins?	146.8608983401492
First rate, sir.	206.95890078852332
I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico.	118.34600663856955
How are things going?	240.8848148949232
Just keeping alive.	120.89424491031329
Lovely weather we ’ re having.	74.82000820920256
Yes, indeed.	383.04116208189424
Good for the country.	526.1715083526485
Those farmers are always grumbling.	38.15267343966335
I ’ ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins.	73.30683177467512
Yes, sir.	733.512678382765
Terrible affair that _General Slocum_ explosion.	23.813158575575002
Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.	31.187700826787037
And heartrending scenes.	390.68701145854294
Men trampling down women and children.	8.95278726346802
Most brutal thing.	68.75805565674192
What do they say was the cause?	601.5877751117487
Spontaneous combustion.	275.29382542023205
Most scandalous revelation.	68.75805565674192
Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst.	32.20501355345741
What I can ’ t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that...	78.78377793412533
Now, you ’ re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.	231.1077198213194
You know why?	366.98962170282624
Palm oil.	275.29382542023205
Is that a fact?	27.83750846848174
Without a doubt.	131.30516029781268
Well now, look at that.	93.96222415138546
And America they say is the land of the free.	599.6675868423007
I thought we were bad here.	1345.7629666318985
I smiled at him.	169.71388962315962
_America, _ I said quietly, just like that.	172.69362735027653
_What is it?	90.46232664429056
The sweepings of every country including our own.	49.95011045733362
Isn ’ t that true? _ That ’ s a fact.	95.34815899074638
Graft, my dear sir.	88.72933091469591
Well, of course, where there ’ s money going there ’ s always someone to pick it up.	136.57481936666252
Saw him looking at my frockcoat.	13.464851748555581
Dress does it.	83.3736732224052
Nothing like a dressy appearance.	201.26624352991962
Bowls them over.	129.53949124709393
— Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	99.9450800279206
How are things?	390.7405250170588
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	47.91478184608078
Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser.	15.559514583050754
Stylish coat, beyond a doubt.	34.305372599818156
Scott of Dawson street.	87.53441544130281
Never built under three guineas.	163.41726608483322
Fits me down to the ground.	670.4920747963475
Some Kildare street club toff had it probably.	20.48013780534701
John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.	75.08480160509161
Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows.	25.09811814018101
Knight of the road.	574.8886853261546
Gentleman.	1218.4197832253003
And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir.	210.58375261846166
The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.	77.15321993019876
North wall and sir John Rogerson ’ s quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.	22.348417043743673
Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image.	29.881871293933024
High colour, of course.	98.19831460019181
Grizzled moustache.	275.29382542023205
Returned Indian officer.	88.40530891686868
Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders.	12.453968684482208
Is that Ned Lambert ’ s brother over the way, Sam?	218.38567793904062
What?	1560.489681896445
Yes.	1763.135277433406
He ’ s as like it as damn it.	98.84142128360483
No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there.	167.58596782771872
Damn like him.	92.6915347808875
Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.	15.34489605350239
Good drop of gin, that was.	138.76356983139252
His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.	43.06413994067836
Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered.	15.08957807802768
Greasy black rope.	88.40530891686868
Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant ’ s wife drove by in her noddy.	41.701530223096796
Bad times those were.	48.669743174887174
Well, well.	550.2494887498718
Over and done with.	47.20766344184823
Great topers too.	56.5222700052377
Fourbottle men.	275.29382542023205
Let me see.	170.2422375146227
Is he buried in saint Michan ’ s?	23.327230274484545
Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin.	708.7916693009931
Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall.	61.07512549211674
Dignam is there now.	74.37983367089872
Went out in a puff.	169.8541079176408
Well, well.	550.2494887498718
Better turn down here.	50.240979573921024
Make a detour.	51.7829097672462
Outside the Dublin Distillers Company ’ s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel.	26.059448882771722
Damn dangerous thing.	65.2250498025695
Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens.	58.20040992308204
Runaway horse.	275.29382542023205
Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton ’ s office, led his wife over O ’ Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.	30.886510566344644
Mr Kernan approached Island street.	32.60246681217368
Times of the troubles.	1062.7314527641638
When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement.	102.79487635865947
Gaming at Daly ’ s.	165.4120140740218
No cardsharping then.	400.9555695172086
One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger.	48.54682972839196
Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr.	13.529938167850503
Stables behind Moira house.	62.22887584450824
Damn good gin that was.	87.46325866930815
Fine dashing young nobleman.	32.60572729737088
Good stock, of course.	130.3640205388296
That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away.	98.9043752238337
Course they were on the wrong side.	173.98228189684167
They rose in dark and evil days.	70.02357217114655
Fine poem that is: Ingram.	102.54679598563888
They were gentlemen.	216.2145274973736
Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly.	31.059305703247972
Masterly rendition.	275.29382542023205
_At the siege of Ross did my father <URL> A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles.	10.058835623157238
Frockcoats.	1218.4197832253003
Cream sunshades.	203.07158957055697
Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.	30.384048763939422
His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair.	24.537237003525178
Damn it! What a pity! * * * Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary ’ s fingers prove a timedulled chain.	28.081462701125613
Dust webbed the window and the showtrays.	359.47898961644376
Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.	21.690451747619335
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.	10.251105444226873
Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness.	38.11997251073553
Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows.	75.23463852507656
Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.	13.701933214927815
She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic.	34.798723576603486
A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her.	23.06262474545273
A long and seafed silent rut.	64.2370830426024
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.	23.461685727677
Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses ’ beard.	43.99148353981527
Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.	40.06824952885733

Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife ’ s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.	41.782464319153036
The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on.	22.464649791340094
Beingless beings.	275.29382542023205
Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within.	34.591128916908886

Bawd and butcher were the words.	49.1661159587833
I say! Not yet awhile.	183.9353879716527
A look around.	328.45820040497097
Yes, quite true.	268.4011625525869
You say right, sir.	377.67222013302694
Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade.	268.7778229774848
In Clohissey ’ s window a faded <NUM> print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye.	31.34852358194004
Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering.	43.75074852661815
The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists.	18.753974465919946

He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.	166.19386512958962

Stephen said.	1030.5290426386453
A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides.	21.136245605455418
It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots.	19.638294491595513

Stephen asked.	470.01027702798706
— I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously.	323.20945982760685
Is it any good?	57.488293048498036

he asked.	72.62503664047722

She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.	43.203242628404574

Misery! Misery! * * * — Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	23.556481319772633
How are things?	390.7405250170588
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	47.91478184608078
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter ’ s.	53.34136304472919
Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.	46.98588891436253
— What ’ s the best news?	152.60144329748246
Mr Dedalus said.	49.31984549386607
— Why then not much, Father Cowley said.	127.58797741779226
I ’ m barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.	101.26294036840606
— Jolly, Mr Dedalus said.	337.69093635120953
Who is it?	333.46369983691807
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.	93.60681421565357
— With a broken back, is it?	118.81854731400438
Mr Dedalus asked.	48.512604837671255
— The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered.	196.2087750504268
Reuben of that ilk.	444.5321702751511
He ’ s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off.	254.529012074918
All I want is a little time.	80.55554546697341
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.	70.2870900437871
— I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	605.1849241520541
Poor old bockedy Ben! He ’ s always doing a good turn for someone.	48.918983969347735
Hold hard! He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.	41.35407034343318
— There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.	133.78519915301533
Ben Dollard ’ s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.	16.29241924762091
He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.	23.587838111544563
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted: — Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.	47.51478158377533
— Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.	123.39261708199282
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard ’ s figure.	33.97909907859217
Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly: — That ’ s a pretty garment, isn ’ t it, for a summer ’ s day?	385.48332863672954
— Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.	36.90186714630186
He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying: — They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.	71.48374089818547
— Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.	107.20398983282392
Thanks be to God he ’ s not paid yet.	52.38504775705722
— And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin?	169.10041980780497
Father Cowley asked.	980.9137325952165
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.	15.01796405620335
Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter ’ s mouth, gave forth a deep note.	23.306787695156892
— Aw! he said.	504.2569269728473
— That ’ s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.	143.90528619538188
— What about that?	445.4136931529425
Ben Dollard said.	44.09050769786724
Not too dusty?	79.23143784720237
What?	1560.489681896445
He turned to both.	727.9018006463763
— That ’ ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.	632.7739994293079
The reverend Hugh C.	25.07065305196067
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.	43.542280868342914
— Come along with me to the subsheriff ’ s office, he said.	386.1584207673217
I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.	169.88979179180495
He ’ s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun.	69.98052177974004
He ’ s well worth seeing, mind you.	34.36143986866275
Come along.	357.6782791482739
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don ’ t...	133.65193846462938
Wait awhile...	161.06877971517477
We ’ re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.	59.296611009569816
— For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.	217.72792787136225
Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.	41.237619543623794
— What few days?	468.1719150027192
he boomed.	289.0602866898494
Hasn ’ t your landlord distrained for rent?	80.59489833035289
— He has, Father Cowley said.	505.84125248095836
— Then our friend ’ s writ is not worth the paper it ’ s printed on, Ben Dollard said.	73.10773075025732
The landlord has the prior claim.	67.18562585780053
I gave him all the particulars.	1064.6383243127332
<NUM> Windsor avenue.	553.5707355571625
Love is the name?	220.79495418913393
— That ’ s right, Father Cowley said.	219.07906643641735
The reverend Mr Love.	35.56823224150512
He ’ s a minister in the country somewhere.	320.6554481601081
But are you sure of that?	775.9201579694607
— You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.	209.5723268557839
He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.	138.5573714137867
— Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.	92.45687069684892
* * * — The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.	58.161694364932536
The policeman touched his forehead.	138.01823933796987
— God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.	723.7027256744318
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.	66.74062005888543
Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy ’ s head by Miss Douce ’ s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.	35.75190953044143
— Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.	360.67132219055605
I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.	44.014969791432605
— You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.	113.88420069421306
— Boyd?	3933.1036573861734
Martin Cunningham said shortly.	242.8677685293204
Touch me not.	55.52688794041185
John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.	14.793511455400632
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.	35.935413634122845
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.	32.72702230533201
— Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_ office.	90.36561019867294
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.	121.98668399938276
— Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.	104.01632774660023
And put down the five shillings too.	362.5108693709135
— Without a second word either, Mr Power said.	106.88155717629131
— Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.	208.89675339371115
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.	41.40727017180878
— I ’ ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.	257.590894549269
They went down Parliament street.	613.6313644744581
— There ’ s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh ’ s.	335.1354444259142
— Righto, Martin Cunningham said.	364.7660836518038
Here goes.	184.39753346034524
Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney ’ s brother - in - law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.	30.876006454951884
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson ’ s watches.	38.98309946645743
— The assistant town clerk ’ s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.	43.908669570141086
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh ’ s winerooms.	339.25834578247407
The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.	32.909020527396585
Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.	10.679208263928277
— And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.	86.15206048132104
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.	54.57526229104973
— Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.	227.52206711463018
Long John Fanning made no way for them.	19.093768148268953
He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.	35.076244742961805
— Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?	42.26687953941893
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.	36.01171505052777
Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language.	15.938123255787852
Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber.	192.17996731110776
And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him.	51.86279974290334
Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.	36.707945929870895
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.	16.48467463997013
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.	42.04846148763619
— What Dignam was that?	249.7919882052503
long John Fanning asked.	91.50757023975126
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.	58.262102453667644
— O, my corns! he said plaintively.	159.43206146632207
Come upstairs for goodness ’ sake till I sit down somewhere.	28.341607000555577
Uff! Ooo! Mind! Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning ’ s flank and passed in and up the stairs.	47.70781684477412
I don ’ t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.	47.12345752168965
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.	135.66821283241492
— Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.	75.85815205695279
— Rather lowsized.	1087.3098553290918
Dignam of Menton ’ s office that was, Martin Cunningham said.	150.77533732415313
Long John Fanning could not remember him.	24.780240117101254
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.	38.17713821735277
— What ’ s that?	399.7624183592977
Martin Cunningham said.	186.94174767915294
All turned where they stood.	60.058820442082066
John Wyse Nolan came down again.	54.36723706581201
From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.	22.256247484539085
Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.	47.15120651477171
In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.	114.65954135101673
— What was it?	1446.3043068168956
Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.	48.51636673132248
— The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.	34.53165308100501
* * * As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines: — Parnell ’ s brother.	32.034853773059176
There in the corner.	418.99865540766183
They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.	20.228435164260816
— Is that he?	15387.040216805577
Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.	77.90081027578202
— Yes, Mulligan said.	3824.9483283804557
That ’ s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.	155.73456955389062
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.	17.31676514812228
An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.	42.666649946914134
— I ’ ll take a _mélange, _ Haines said to the waitress.	170.01749846874787
— Two _mélanges, _ Buck Mulligan said.	178.02611913426617
And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.	41.774230484103974
When she had gone he said, laughing: — We call it <URL>. because they have damn bad cakes.	218.2783688098606
O, but you missed Dedalus on <URL> Haines opened his newbought book.	46.0938716250195
— I ’ m sorry, he said.	526.912499211801
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.	24.571126565033385
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of <NUM> Nelson street: — _England expects_...	112.73484362192148
Buck Mulligan ’ s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.	54.060984409938
— You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.	442.1186383679862
Wandering Ængus I call him.	50.601171303880115
— I am sure he has an _idée fixe, _ Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger.	84.23404133731621
Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be.	153.1988575178698
Such persons always have.	41.04823647333389
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.	77.23423432209773
— They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.	209.1300825878905
He will never capture the Attic note.	54.10247190388756
That is his tragedy.	48.038438755494894
He can never be a poet.	140.14102335893756
The joy of creation...	92.60914029251363
— Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.	154.6000972163483
I see.	431.75195169869767
I tackled him this morning on belief.	81.71480698754698
There was something on his mind, I saw.	91.04153606491704
It ’ s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.	27.270139019765818
Buck Mulligan ’ s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.	50.77730878457428
He helped her to unload her tray.	73.36001513125372
— He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups.	49.11939255632621
The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution.	78.08993724610671
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.	22.451159801706858
Does he write anything for your movement?	24.114705554534655
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.	61.07774407669972
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith.	13.288592170840428
He bit off a soft piece hungrily.	103.15220504269331
— Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.	559.4790486022068
He is going to write something in ten years.	62.36676136252542
— Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.	66.75614679503609
Still, I shouldn ’ t wonder if he did after all.	115.86571952322032
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.	119.32643663640813
— This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.	56.93615157430121
I don ’ t want to be imposed on.	97.26463422862751
Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson ’ s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	13.13707412492073
* * * Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell ’ s yard.	35.98739220077365
Behind him Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith ’ s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square.	17.71296816145191
Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.	163.80316377283734
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner ’ s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.	36.61973284043864
At the corner of Wilde ’ s house he halted, frowned at Elijah ’ s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke ’ s lawn.	100.1876838236479
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.	164.81009140725376
With ratsteeth bared he muttered: — _Coactus <URL> He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.	35.16043730364542
As he strode past Mr Bloom ’ s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body.	19.850688639224618
The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.	34.1124701954862
— God ’ s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You ’ re blinder nor I am, you bitch ’ s bastard! * * * Opposite Ruggy O ’ Donohoe ’ s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.	51.54415945052194
It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney ’ s.	30.73603970379251
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.	38.840506518370645
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him.	22.092829351568984
From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently.	12.68514713122918
Gob, that ’ d be a good pucking match to see.	173.14642305688614
Myler Keogh, that ’ s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.	262.0235536233018
Two bar entrance, soldiers half price.	17.630918954598897
I could easy do a bunk on ma.	54.62745798319358
Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned.	106.84108456854216
That ’ s me in mourning.	243.05732392463898
When is it?	595.4584880176138
May the twentysecond.	83.95386918070322
Sure, the blooming thing is all over.	121.4110917887658
He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up.	232.1703372336071
Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers.	56.551646930895345
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.	54.913432050710384
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.	19.929139268341668
The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons.	39.19678488839095
One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man.	82.41622394004156
But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.	26.69420196459026
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff ’ s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.	88.16349873464183
No Sandymount tram.	400.9555695172086
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand.	23.38223855317879
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.	93.21638885152444
The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it.	78.9865544243626
He met schoolboys with satchels.	89.50113954577179
I ’ m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday.	27.678321433478562
He met other schoolboys.	156.13519722952728
Do they notice I ’ m in mourning?	37.92969619464038
Uncle Barney said he ’ d get it into the paper tonight.	93.09423277466595
Then they ’ ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa ’ s name.	118.03964736124793
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye.	77.18588235617976
The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.	80.54590995714842
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend.	40.859784832015485
A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking.	120.01583525387439
The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney ’ s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.	67.3134437619121
Never see him again.	51.12634834864647
Death, that is.	141.611446969042
Pa is dead.	88.52725736821226
My father is dead.	43.46740862366762
He told me to be a good son to ma.	155.27861460589972
I couldn ’ t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better.	135.2627761246768
Poor pa.	189.02278011911127
That was Mr Dignam, my father.	134.80342444051578
I hope he ’ s in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.	79.57806048664332
* * * William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge.	17.73871581367974

The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays.	27.75856494257879
The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis.	59.16024176403045
At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar.	25.756844813165774

White ’ s, the pawnbroker ’ s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus.	37.8371321438356
In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise.	36.24190813973773
Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King ’ s windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty.	32.205387664240824

From Cahill ’ s corner the reverend Hugh C.	91.99969172204105

A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons.	11.747538237555728
Passing by Roger Greene ’ s office and Dollard ’ s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby ’ s cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn ’ t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring ’ s big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant.	39.95724053083729
Beyond Lundy Foot ’ s from the shaded door of Kavanagh ’ s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland.	31.56164032876929
The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G.	26.76831107554721

Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade.	35.433563283453346
Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her.	45.519091935550115
A charming _soubrette, _ great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H.	19.605768565732582

Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently.	26.398479066836007
In Fownes ’ s street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal ’ s first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare.	38.35058363244633
John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it.	13.154890617092335
Where the foreleg of King Billy ’ s horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders.	42.999985272112625

Begin! Bronze by gold, miss Douce ’ s head by miss Kennedy ’ s head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.	45.06282969867658
— Is that her?	1905.440307553121
asked miss Kennedy.	74.27373083625766
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de <URL> — Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.	27.82396414724599
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly: — Look at the fellow in the tall silk.	163.0085158257614
— Who?	969.1116642327058
Where?	2503.021043628515
gold asked more eagerly.	62.20081667228653
— In the second carriage, miss Douce ’ s wet lips said, laughing in the sun.	605.6456667195424
He ’ s looking.	1050.4116682084887
She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.	41.70505181949611
Her wet lips tittered: — He ’ s killed looking back.	121.2619271686904
She laughed: — O wept! Aren ’ t men frightful idiots?	128.4211600853361
With sadness.	1593.8067344417275
Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear.	11.619222187277751
Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.	45.64877208574041
Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.	15.21269726185094
— It ’ s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.	59.95064391706865
A man.	639.7142953832415
Bloowho went by by Moulang ’ s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine ’ s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll ’ s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.	64.80968016780677
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came.	87.1773054184931
And — There ’ s your teas, he said.	497.13064542271104
Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.	18.492398377212012
— What is it?	608.0440085668911
loud boots unmannerly asked.	62.200804154614865
— Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.	252.6648236784889
— Your _beau, _ is it?	131.1090893372765
A haughty bronze replied: — I ’ ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.	132.72027595735884
Bloom.	2255.397063679651
On her flower frowning miss Douce said: — Most aggravating that young brat is.	39.13323782363076
If he doesn ’ t conduct himself I ’ ll wring his ear for him a yard long.	96.99810391897411
Ladylike in exquisite contrast.	62.200804154614865
— Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.	87.29233848578934
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea.	433.3238508857606
They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw.	26.170645185622334
They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.	35.413850122498445
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.	24.468334241083735
— Am I awfully sunburnt?	214.64952108045654
Miss bronze unbloused her neck.	67.1879458383705
It gets brown after.	60.56898795555042
Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?	27.770216669775614
— And leave it to my hands, she said.	569.4705583015945
— Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.	214.28805562381976
Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce — Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated.	22.109842521476548
I asked that old fogey in Boyd ’ s for something for my skin.	22.367566588722845
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed: — O, don ’ t remind me of him for mercy ’ sake! — But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.	63.489247527895635
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.	11.570535485389675
— No, don ’ t, she cried.	713.7650837601683
— I won ’ t listen, she cried.	608.5337942053428
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey ’ s tone: — For your what?	58.09910696605035
says he.	192.4660005952656
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again: — Don ’ t let me think of him or I ’ ll expire.	221.84646416485094
The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.	98.46126044538093
She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.	29.69754072142899
— Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings.	76.32195011808624
Hufa! Hufa! Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy ’ s throat.	30.519217335987253
Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.	21.75983442835381
— O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried.	91.28734315147669
Will you ever forget his goggle eye?	25.298025161309152
Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting: — And your other eye! Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner ’ s name.	23.97014511893773
Why do I always think Figather?	36.956413050577396
Gathering figs, I think.	187.37363312679852
And Prosper Loré ’ s huguenot name.	283.28376947752855
By Bassi ’ s blessed virgins Bloom ’ s dark eyes went by.	120.39192342675805
Bluerobed, white under, come to me.	59.66292197923665
God they believe she is: or goddess.	46.04819304669332
Those today.	174.1034656886683
I could not see.	203.87715137049898
That fellow spoke.	84.08262918421907
A student.	1047.493585384237
After with Dedalus ’ son.	38.93333018708155
He might be Mulligan.	255.11366568366768
All comely virgins.	109.20310675597618
That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.	21.898712037987494
By went his eyes.	235.73436448517322
The sweets of sin.	146.20610957720487
Sweet are the sweets.	48.316571383059845
Of sin.	254.1200568786727
In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye.	13.966108050563749
They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.	21.585695760183537
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.	24.06680713685977
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled.	28.10851569600659
Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying: — O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.	15.718596453450665
With his bit of beard! Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.	23.879125673887216
— Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.	537.0432255016797
Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter.	13.019589662312555
And then laughed more.	676.4185675953694
Greasy I knows.	101.55103292581168
Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge.	11.589917509232704
All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.	30.1117615105162
Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.	126.99482806167926
— O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose.	69.52876663369402
I wished I hadn ’ t laughed so much.	412.6739491622677
I feel all wet.	682.8797896525233
— O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested.	489.1205033620082
You horrid thing! And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.	32.76985260486839
By Cantwell ’ s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi ’ s virgins, bright of their oils.	68.78222850628767
Nannetti ’ s father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I.	35.73247458823753
Religion pays.	275.29382542023205
Must see him for that par.	84.09242443614802
Eat first.	116.09826509251334
I want.	746.202849549263
Not yet.	125.60269325253343
At four, she said.	96.11712899366863
Time ever passing.	80.86293677689468
Clockhands turning.	275.29382542023205
On. Where eat?	203.16410695650254
The Clarence, Dolphin.	213.64728763919373
On. For Raoul.	203.16410695650254
Eat.	385.3327787010857
If I net five guineas with those ads.	55.79316737399722
The violet silk petticoats.	245.3928605025488
Not yet.	125.60269325253343
The sweets of sin.	146.20610957720487
Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.	29.36595468814882
Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus.	45.95909778002555
Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails.	46.995215403824766
He strolled.	1346.0122314981743
— O, welcome back, miss Douce.	690.4226300220673
He held her hand.	162.8280922751538
Enjoyed her holidays?	112.77067707425105
— Tiptop.	2901.269617769212
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.	67.75886620808974
— Gorgeous, she said.	605.2111218940328
Lying out on the strand all day.	117.81755565592752
Bronze whiteness.	156.75711468450862
— That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently.	113.35360118994691
Tempting poor simple males.	50.78059647831953
Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.	19.322917534380654
— O go away! she said.	100.3462945245887
You ’ re very simple, I don ’ t think.	120.64131572734603
He was.	1461.0925129377881
— Well now I am, he mused.	474.06932109020664
I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.	60.208576733395
— You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer.	137.38873281700378
And what did the doctor order today?	88.9995526221083
— Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself.	126.78673535130159
I think I ’ ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.	47.135394972375174
Jingle.	302.9147764884481
— With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.	388.1146327825036
With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s she turned herself.	50.31927751778225
With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg.	25.48960489050954
Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe.	83.43107989826355
Alacrity she served.	112.77067707425105
He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.	145.04308756105547
— By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains.	179.37366002229345
Must be a great tonic in the air down there.	67.74710651253942
But a long threatening comes at last, they say.	34.43320461608921
Yes.	1763.135277433406
Yes.	1763.135277433406
Yes.	1763.135277433406
He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid ’ s, into the bowl.	108.15458810228942
Chips.	994.0946467831135
Shreds.	1218.4197832253003
Musing.	1218.4197832253003
Mute.	1218.4197832253003
None nought said nothing.	69.98659759167344
Yes.	1763.135277433406
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling: — _O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas! _ — Was Mr Lidwell in today?	62.32014654535533
In came Lenehan.	363.0081923093229
Round him peered Lenehan.	40.83677093919258
Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge.	126.42433751975949
Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex.	205.90429424708856
To Martha I must write.	189.73570272234682
Buy paper.	217.21349569404808
Daly ’ s.	804.0366525215602
Girl there civil.	69.15309015046209
Bloom.	2255.397063679651
Old Bloom.	111.62074797236366
Blue bloom is on the rye.	34.355026027160626
— He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.	408.5964294358679
Lenehan came forward.	165.28154242281553
— Was Mr Boylan looking for me?	135.35503932424956
He asked.	1171.0928579582594
She answered: — Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?	99.71791084103955
She asked.	1099.0941938433475
Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page: — No. He was not.	73.64650512530673
Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.	52.57435106494176
— Peep! Who ’ s in the corner?	1101.9191897413089
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures.	36.35529146685807
To mind her stops.	197.46715935073098
To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.	27.478232659736946
Jingle jaunty jingle.	64.5538719686575
Girlgold she read and did not glance.	50.092336103745815
Take no notice.	84.685365147968
She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly: — Ah fox met ah stork.	17.110449511783273
Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?	8.857686192397525
He droned in vain.	193.41880260491592
Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.	449.774225424573
He sighed aside: — Ah me! O my! He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.	88.6651649692437
— Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.	118.20746045091596
— Who may he be?	155.37297375825074
Mr Dedalus asked.	48.512604837671255
Lenehan opened most genial arms.	32.23821193323435
Who?	6852.683178373304
— Who may he be?	155.37297375825074
he asked.	72.62503664047722
Can you ask?	105.9953397350703
Dry.	1218.4197832253003
Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.	22.225050419819254
— I see, he said.	908.5489930787569
I didn ’ t recognise him for the moment.	390.94236964061145
I hear he is keeping very select company.	56.51589066073924
Have you seen him lately?	43.078615578580475
He had.	1569.9606681842406
— I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.	216.68613593101566
He smiled at bronze ’ s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes: — The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips.	33.45943236600002
The ponderous pundit, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin ’ s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O ’ Madden Burke.	67.04243337883977
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and — That must have been highly diverting, said he.	26.49977052276103
I see.	431.75195169869767
He see.	1488.8579268176288
He drank.	618.3053252185216
With faraway mourning mountain eye.	120.23398652030316
Set down his glass.	78.75074950904587
— I see you have moved the piano.	249.2339614799767
— The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.	145.3731201177977
— Is that a fact?	95.1359391604626
— Didn ’ t he, miss Kennedy?	480.13698949932024
The real classical, you know.	96.540819635719
Not twenty I ’ m sure he was.	71.2471797536898
— Is that a fact?	95.1359391604626
Mr Dedalus said.	49.31984549386607
He drank and strayed away.	71.702898964324
— So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.	133.72511804559213
God ’ s curse on bitch ’ s bastard.	164.78760558446837
Tink to her pity cried a diner ’ s bell.	139.358287602038
To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond.	25.511342833669293
Lager for diner.	101.55103292581168
Lager without alacrity she served.	34.17524935538088
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.	55.94861697936231
Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires.	55.91300016994852
He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.	50.72507749528118
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s wise Bloom in Daly ’ s Henry Flower bought.	37.69281413802844
Are you not happy in your home?	58.09465061194363
Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo.	48.326273277219876
Means something, language of flow.	46.62786941445898
Was it a daisy?	48.25684260577383
Innocence that is.	422.1458406277394
Respectable girl meet after mass.	34.17524935538088
Thanks awfully muchly.	81.09197434165084
Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.	52.11132329333918
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all.	87.82126088385589
Hair streaming: lovelorn.	46.611275389005364
For some man.	137.1778331064341
For Raoul.	317.6210496806929
He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car.	21.453808177168334
It is.	850.9665119892003
Again.	14.665309092669064
Coincidence.	440.858884305153
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.	20.509731951138452
Follow.	812.0832237234374
Risk it.	275.5388195470069
Go quick.	160.6886987473072
At four.	68.99618101676283
Near now.	142.44625794082017
Out.	503.4838481820751
— Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.	491.14416520121705
— Aha...	750.2176745106843
I was forgetting...	131.30030141829667
Excuse...	85.83844112581325
— And four.	4147.081029950009
At four she.	37.24456716341663
Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled.	44.898178407770196
Bloo smi qui go.	53.11162088141111
Ternoon.	1218.4197832253003
Think you ’ re the only pebble on the beach?	107.1327004111951
For men.	267.0864020856168
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.	75.26055483109386
From the saloon a call came, long in dying.	19.14606591643274
That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck.	92.52984811945876
A call again.	355.1564782565225
That he now poised that it now throbbed.	48.539543026643585
You hear?	1839.8828120944058
It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs.	14.121043069880383
Longer in dying call.	69.81804203787918
Pat paid for diner ’ s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss Douce.	29.8010441721859
— _The bright stars fade_...	108.66562732712786
A voiceless song sang from within, singing: —...	78.25067367088135
_the morn is <URL> A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands.	18.511093094094353
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love ’ s leavetaking, life ’ s, love ’ s morn.	57.28982827862
— _The dewdrops pearl_...	130.82244979405178
Lenehan ’ s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.	24.322967028928282
— But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.	247.5901977518394
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.	77.55075645612312
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.	26.157288025243812
— Did she fall or was she pushed?	82.82745757575688
he asked her.	81.34246357540638
She answered, slighting: — Ask no questions and you ’ ll hear no lies.	98.67022074190064
Like lady, ladylike.	89.15206075390302
Blazes Boylan ’ s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.	58.75991380991316
Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar.	92.49798560940762
Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him: — See the conquering hero comes.	37.79950833289335
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero.	17.945128353001124
See me he might.	2843.187159044914
The seat he sat on: warm.	99.32476620175791
Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding ’ s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.	27.78402819978038
— _And I from thee_...	89.4884409553461
— I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.	201.46434174499194
He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw.	67.94573833178433
She smiled on him.	322.4937509625733
But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.	48.49239445588386
Smart Boylan bespoke potions.	47.95886141701586
— What ’ s your cry?	324.93991809904855
Glass of bitter?	79.31747223513555
Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me.	54.701271452939274
Not yet.	125.60269325253343
At four she.	37.24456716341663
Who said four?	535.0129016449681
Cowley ’ s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff ’ s office.	123.89223993646208
Avoid.	1218.4197832253003
Goulding a chance.	108.34259497410862
What is he doing in the Ormond?	575.3478458654452
Car waiting.	203.07158957055697
Wait.	199.9002065950114
Hello.	198.81596679899442
Where off to?	637.7026054669799
Something to eat?	71.26728759838956
I too was just.	1993.6872873917234
In here.	1187.4629524075538
What, Ormond?	226.6655526795799
Best value in Dublin.	43.882318299950015
Is that so?	482.7771736075477
Diningroom.	1218.4197832253003
Sit tight there.	49.33739833979864
See, not be seen.	1448.5941778810286
I think I ’ ll join you.	163.0188988425543
Come on.	162.8815627186843
Richie led on.	83.98210390580523
Bloom followed bag.	455.6686663098088
Dinner fit for a prince.	245.31083823129555
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.	25.353136202517273
— O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch.	100.45826290164824
— Why don ’ t you grow?	454.9585250771193
asked Blazes Boylan.	74.43949354168281
That is to say she.	151.34638385764987
Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.	44.898178407770196
He pitched a broad coin down.	75.05202713263337
Coin rang.	170.76217170975505
— Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...	92.80011742266818
— Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.	137.44795768013964
— Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.	233.72324326665216
— I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking.	204.30873963371837
Not on my own, you know.	47.88207767334586
Fancy of a friend of mine.	55.49168269132154
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce ’ s lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.	37.54889324986463
Idolores.	1218.4197832253003
The eastern seas.	495.76726678683906
Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray.	17.598085861564503
Clock clacked.	141.62028169530706
Miss Douce took Boylan ’ s coin, struck boldly the cashregister.	33.86610533813011
It clanged.	264.5318366141609
Clock clacked.	141.62028169530706
Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change.	39.000157177332824
Look to the west.	691.6773245387476
A clack.	1047.493585384237
For me.	181.70633345555495
— What time is that?	243.37331566839677
asked Blazes Boylan.	74.43949354168281
Four?	385.3327787010857
O ’ clock.	1794.5932726269693
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan ’ s elbowsleeve.	22.414458214782265
— Let ’ s hear the time, he said.	1609.3371586822734
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.	20.548059357512166
Be near.	126.71519591495496
At four.	68.99618101676283
Has he forgotten?	54.59807899451656
Perhaps a trick.	87.4590473828912
Not come: whet appetite.	37.60435502958737
I couldn ’ t do.	400.37262964081646
Wait, wait.	151.66242586769988
Pat, waiter, waited.	31.05576512160525
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure ’ s skyblue bow and eyes.	50.56459632589149
— Go on, pressed Lenehan.	36.798381424513856
There ’ s no - one.	58.8402498789232
He never heard.	481.5764543162897
—...	84.74620418301832
_to Flora ’ s lips did <URL> High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.	36.13479428505053
Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes Boylan ’ s flower and eyes.	30.03643832841902
— Please, please.	413.4187349602203
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.	48.79002389715881
— _I could not leave thee_...	91.43521094080083
— Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.	842.5614740212949
— No, now, urged Lenehan.	311.67246063212446
_Sonnez la cloche! _ O do! There ’ s no - one.	58.1489203246872
She looked.	1053.0963248001412
Quick.	205.8047902042597
Miss Kenn out of earshot.	138.26582038784824
Sudden bent.	275.29382542023205
Two kindling faces watched her bend.	28.751114109023707
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.	93.55434353451585
— Go on! Do! _Sonnez! _ Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee.	37.0056282895288
Delayed.	1218.4197832253003
Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.	33.70816826093217
_ — Sonnez! _ Smack.	138.8923865109426
She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman ’ s warmhosed thigh.	23.662144928503483
— _La cloche! _ cried gleeful Lenehan.	214.2250880597338
Trained by owner.	78.24504091227193
No sawdust there.	401.70352205332847
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren ’ t men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.	43.254029227689266
— You ’ re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.	69.398394632908
Boylan, eyed, eyed.	58.68007304880851
Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops.	13.20984885478458
His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.	15.475484042366901
Yes, bronze from anearby.	159.39511472154163
—...	84.74620418301832
_Sweetheart, goodbye! _ — I ’ m off, said Boylan with impatience.	70.22243315541074
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.	37.10783871928675
— Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly.	63.27158433252775
I wanted to tell you.	139.97749488014426
Tom Rochford...	54.338995557021384
— Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.	191.60149444202736
Lenehan gulped to go.	57.20969768620643
— Got the horn or what?	149.47159829844549
he said.	401.7011151401686
Wait.	199.9002065950114
I ’ m coming.	202.83194634218736
— How do you do, Mr Dollard?	346.6325060534414
— Eh?	2525.3402546441253
How do?	200.91282764207378
How do?	200.91282764207378
Ben Dollard ’ s vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley ’ s woe.	116.68900670822356
He won ’ t give you any trouble, Bob.	114.8119684213817
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow.	129.74060946002953
We ’ ll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot ’ s ear this time.	86.20916520744476
Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.	75.87262814061478
— Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily.	107.12027094163803
Come on, Simon.	43.900708611394734
Give us a ditty.	41.82135719583558
We heard the piano.	325.07092038648614
Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders.	13.711431292250973
Power for Richie.	97.47226833589909
And Bloom?	493.8377565158458
Let me see.	170.2422375146227
Not make him walk twice.	59.42375633616798
His corns.	1322.4554482011363
Four now.	116.09826509251334
How warm this black is.	44.60502359305995
Course nerves a bit.	150.8844370715123
Refracts (is it?) heat.	56.40223016596792
Let me see.	170.2422375146227
Cider.	812.0832237234374
Yes, bottle of cider.	183.39367763967985
— What ’ s that?	399.7624183592977
Mr Dedalus said.	49.31984549386607
— Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called.	85.08178049279375
Begone dull care.	112.77067707425105
Come, Bob.	97.97923703805962
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon.	34.20053165883468
He plumped him Dollard on the stool.	239.58230939382537
Plumped, stopped abrupt.	74.69924435094208
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning.	46.13622761354586
Bothered, he wanted Power and cider.	196.1173118689598
Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.	57.93238420582229
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.	42.64102400994014
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound.	95.57755466266975
He ’ s off.	814.5341898311167
Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.	35.73662500403866
Jingling.	684.2060590120853
He ’ s gone.	484.59982318801724
Jingle.	302.9147764884481
Hear.	684.2060590120853
— Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.	80.47159497682298
God be with old times.	97.5067603939229
Miss Douce ’ s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight.	36.708680973363265
Gone.	195.9801606796253
Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord.	41.36193258288866
She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, _eau de <URL> — Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them.	15.368953455235511
There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.	28.483781568878737
There was.	298.99429622770043
— A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.	104.52682681576982
The devil wouldn ’ t stop him.	231.93062915090408
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.	106.91538543997959
— God, do you remember?	1645.4460146379877
Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard.	184.31291781529072
And by Japers I had no wedding garment.	81.07267552302721
They laughed all three.	195.70647693552496
He had no wed.	204.22206541735156
All trio laughed.	109.20310675597618
No wedding garment.	400.9555695172086
— Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said.	31.571056858988772
Where ’ s my pipe, by the way?	248.68928471902578
He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe.	238.2841089472727
Bald Pat carried two diners ’ drinks, Richie and Poldy.	14.335102059198233
And Father Cowley laughed again.	719.5029552013681
— I saved the situation, Ben, I think.	217.00970681616815
— You did, averred Ben Dollard.	166.66021753758255
I remember those tight trousers too.	73.31974119087221
That was a brilliant idea, Bob.	37.82986032246458
Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes.	102.31781999444068
He saved the situa.	187.50852835663326
Tight trou.	104.48244077495224

Richie cocked his lips apout.	62.77170614558628

Mournful he whistled.	112.77067707425105
Fall, surrender, lost.	10.418379905819634

Or he feels.	551.148945646556
Still harping on his daughter.	290.1317003881738
Wise child that knows her father, Dedalus said.	31.300389071615005

Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.	17.454173254981825
— With it, Simon.	1757.411083585675
— It, Simon.	349.39405568820024

I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.	21.514838755847528
— Lo, Joe, says I.	266.14554265981235
How are you blowing?	73.26254067643475
Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?	19.4737215675133
— Soot ’ s luck, says Joe.	418.1373543549205
Who ’ s the old ballocks you were talking to?	162.7227862956404
— Old Troy, says I, was in the force.	428.77615725054596
— What are you doing round those parts?	73.69784591264813
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Devil a much, says I.	370.0587484300221
There ’ s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane — old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him — lifted any God ’ s quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop - of - my - thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.	31.772772156546132
— Circumcised?	3933.1036573861734
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Ay, says I.	411.6739948492964
A bit off the top.	241.84053873555834
An old plumber named Geraghty.	21.017736118686283
I ’ m hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can ’ t get a penny out of him.	115.76014830289219
— That the lay you ’ re on now?	201.55491718154138
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Ay, says I.	411.6739948492964
How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts.	28.832113292865998
But that ’ s the most notorious bloody robber you ’ d meet in a day ’ s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain.	66.22100040087797
_Tell him, _ says he, _I dare him, _ says he, _and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, _ says he, _I ’ ll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a <URL> And he after stuffing himself till he ’ s fit to burst.	35.210174980999696
Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out.	102.4353469497341
_He drink me my teas.	46.903448726972684
He eat me my sugars.	134.02757715873327
Because he no pay me my moneys? _ For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of <NUM> Saint Kevin ’ s parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E.	15.689075934596389
Geraghty, esquire, of <NUM> Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.	15.704858947255147
— Are you a strict <URL>.?	171.70019080836977
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Not taking anything between drinks, says I.	93.06913201499204
— What about paying our respects to our friend?	60.84055382105206
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Who?	969.1116642327058
says I.	589.3102590128412
Sure, he ’ s out in John of God ’ s off his head, poor man.	142.4536579771765
— Drinking his own stuff?	360.1490040529446
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Ay, says I.	411.6739948492964
Whisky and water on the brain.	285.6317718674825
— Come around to Barney Kiernan ’ s, says Joe.	126.91854346241122
I want to see the citizen.	181.89106318685094
— Barney mavourneen ’ s be it, says I.	935.2710770721328
Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?	39.963662304910024
— Not a word, says Joe.	139.42151220848754
I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.	162.96979809185154
— What was that, Joe?	350.42184539524504
says I.	589.3102590128412
— Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease.	113.8682685365065
I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.	58.0427904988941
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another.	98.57798694408068
Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it.	461.4445085097206
Jesus, I couldn ’ t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber.	92.19448392748848
For trading without a licence, says he.	35.6025279768274
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan.	55.681997722412916
There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar.	30.03650308380058
There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown.	14.459493050445117
A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated.	91.67097770536242
In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied.	53.512938337393976
Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects.	11.099452372156032
And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan ’ s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.	27.110144833907807
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O ’ Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains.	15.629965734050392
Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.	8.35037001535244
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.	214.4330821323095
Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber! And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffe ’ s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M ’ Gillicuddy ’ s reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer ’ s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.	11.057955330945148
So we turned into Barney Kiernan ’ s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.	70.26776331670163
— There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.	47.457251638065586
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.	75.02434891298725
Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog.	25.629140548059315
I ’ m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.	64.88157106100952
— Stand and deliver, says he.	115.79108373413827
— That ’ s all right, citizen, says Joe.	73.06788800021518
Friends here.	275.4037003071251
— Pass, friends, says he.	133.8379568863191
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he: — What ’ s your opinion of the times?	130.54494998363757
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill.	66.1846822459186
But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.	101.53293886166112
— I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.	87.00910773796593
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says: — Foreign wars is the cause of it.	159.96821257023296
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket: — It ’ s the Russians wish to tyrannise.	94.95875037563187
— Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I.	55.27450653551874
I ’ ve a thirst on me I wouldn ’ t sell for half a crown.	38.54146775618519
— Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.	77.9304701997392
— Wine of the country, says he.	373.0395645212515
— What ’ s yours?	717.8664072518823
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.	414.5197633540676
— Three pints, Terry, says Joe.	70.04381552469312
And how ’ s the old heart, citizen?	283.7764831666821
says he.	192.4660005952656
— Never better, _a chara_, says he.	57.76928824519365
What Garry?	1386.2450688890237
Are we going to win?	214.22949765098622
Eh?	196.96504069019625
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.	258.5137690411619
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero.	18.928869813047083
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).	15.030080880738666
The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest.	25.60995917508922
The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower.	90.63877197990345
A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.	34.768179127402206
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes.	18.717946173987844
Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut.	12.39141702267987
His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast.	33.5089705474784
From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O ’ Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O ’ Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O ’ Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M ’ Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.	8.987481748245031
Fursa, S.	112.77067707425105
Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn ’ t, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L.	69.54052139376057
Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W.	10.980937671047961
Shakespeare, Brian Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O ’ Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O ’ Sullivan Beare.	13.500912502438123
A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.	15.00737132690065
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid.	22.366692540835764
O, as true as I ’ m telling you.	98.27793008692088
A goodlooking sovereign.	328.45820040497097
— And there ’ s more where that came from, says he.	196.2488438575864
— Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe?	81.74968851160541
says I.	589.3102590128412
— Sweat of my brow, says Joe.	126.59655396838215
’ Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.	27.53005478046225
— I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod ’ s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.	82.62938969371967
Who comes through Michan ’ s land, bedight in sable armour?	70.02690088030133
O ’ Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he.	219.18243713058578
Impervious to fear is Rory ’ s son: he of the prudent soul.	95.99642870155633
— For the old woman of Prince ’ s street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ.	109.32035474302998
The pledgebound party on the floor of the house.	300.6405609327189
And look at this blasted rag, says he.	68.00013353314928
_The Irish Independent, _ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman ’ s friend.	40.820261708611
Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland Independent, _ and I ’ ll thank you and the marriages.	104.52816575402736
And he starts reading them out: — Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne ’ s on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son.	26.79009445692441
How ’ s that, eh?	157.48980706880096
Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, <NUM> Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude ’ s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester.	25.542018530771678
Eh?	196.96504069019625
Deaths.	1218.4197832253003
Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...	19.834000834099832
— I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.	175.39662764230604
— Cockburn.	3933.1036573861734
Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June <NUM>, at <NUM> Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen.	19.09622354809245
How ’ s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How ’ s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?	80.76416226787602
— Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose.	232.11684484761534
Thanks be to God they had the start of us.	27.288183524934972
Drink that, citizen.	117.97122819767877
— I will, says he, honourable person.	218.33518486715607
— Health, Joe, says I.	246.41742773669847
And all down the form.	1139.7095628848406
Ah! Ow! Don ’ t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.	85.57854145764588
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.	34.63491533002361
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.	16.695375453253625
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney ’ s snug, squeezed up with the laughing.	26.942357624695866
And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn ’ t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran.	56.10750030488257
I didn ’ t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door.	347.0606972484893
And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle.	49.05080389240391
I thought Alf would split.	455.7555670864416
— Look at him, says he.	280.70610784759157
Breen.	1218.4197832253003
He ’ s traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U.	114.67328007994084
p: up on it to take a li...	510.4203137883271
And he doubled up.	157.60014118617798
— Take a what?	286.564442414689
says I.	589.3102590128412
— Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.	164.59332666055883
— O hell! says I.	539.5514409992494
The bloody mongrel began to growl that ’ d put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.	59.213197852931806
_ — Bi i dho husht, _ says he.	14.442132742778798
— Who?	969.1116642327058
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Breen, says Alf.	364.58662553911563
He was in John Henry Menton ’ s and then he went round to Collis and Ward ’ s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff ’ s for a lark.	149.07392856433168
O God, I ’ ve a pain laughing.	225.42200897665933
U.	195.00677118397383
p: up.	40.11532574640197
The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.	64.45952920807028
— When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy?	317.4671154999545
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up.	241.78691148516174
Is that Alf Bergan?	344.4802279357573
— Yes, says Alf.	162.69306824915148
Hanging?	684.2060590120853
Wait till I show you.	30.08636448079725
That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds.	97.22000832850458
You should have seen long John ’ s eye.	217.23482983890926
U.	195.00677118397383
p....	636.1025288637607
— Who are you laughing at?	146.3888660221773
says Bob Doran.	67.78145901561068
Is that Bergan?	637.447096873385
— Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.	112.9219654569328
Terence O ’ Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda.	25.07631178327963
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.	17.310308189722857
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.	81.66393988512897
But he, the young chief of the O ’ Bergan ’ s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze.	54.57347805085147
Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.	48.89291323062263
— What ’ s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?	84.06192105322951
— What ’ s that?	399.7624183592977
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino.	38.43286599582295
Talking about hanging, I ’ ll show you something you never saw.	67.56469981758866
Hangmen ’ s letters.	946.8552069838712
Look at here.	372.02639840782405
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.	61.004155138841725
— Are you codding?	424.3117241868435
says I.	589.3102590128412
— Honest injun, says Alf.	164.78921045919958
Read them.	144.65112558436837
So Joe took up the letters.	350.808222468233
— Who are you laughing at?	146.3888660221773
says Bob Doran.	67.78145901561068
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust.	323.87548882677913
Bob ’ s a queer chap when the porter ’ s up in him so says I just to make talk: — How ’ s Willy Murray those times, Alf?	116.61033251132027
— I don ’ t know, says Alf.	138.52119370405995
Only I was running after that...	73.99115276214982
— You what?	906.9559428745207
says Joe, throwing down the letters.	144.37495053251328
With who?	1649.7759487537448
— With Dignam, says Alf.	190.15808945594193
— Is it Paddy?	287.0064156142605
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Yes, says Alf.	162.69306824915148
Why?	2421.489910325178
— Don ’ t you know he ’ s dead?	245.3178946227063
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.	111.0604619186788
— Ay, says Joe.	129.13111139017394
— Sure I ’ m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.	57.92434543227127
— Who ’ s dead?	582.8614992840212
says Bob Doran.	67.78145901561068
— You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.	49.91244308358951
— What?	1096.145065448642
says Alf.	90.63091556479291
Good Christ, only five...	98.83610113728534
What?...	182.43992942859458
And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim ’ s...	117.67163010455728
What?	1560.489681896445
Dignam dead?	211.59579078628542
— What about Dignam?	460.2585118066348
says Bob Doran.	67.78145901561068
Who ’ s talking about...?	449.4742095961396
— Dead! says Alf.	178.26885194439907
He ’ s no more dead than you are.	493.51148758370994
— Maybe so, says Joe.	150.30225337987068
They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.	53.297128551471054
— Paddy?	3003.1525986255756
says Alf.	90.63091556479291
— Ay, says Joe.	129.13111139017394
He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.	115.10951639952953
— Good Christ! says Alf.	110.54283610207824
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.	111.84596743810206
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face.	26.751666398343986
Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.	29.103242461235563
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels.	53.47462366705221
In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.	46.73631085250247
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.	22.199546587872984
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief.	6.084801052855687
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.	31.132418341311666
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body.	99.64137427476336
Mind C.	220.4598998073688
K.	184.25070216920022
doesn ’ t pile it <URL> It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.	70.32084575563331
J.	129.7375304578709
O ’ Neill ’ s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements.	120.45547554506183
Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen ’ s to be soled only as the heels were still good.	35.40297870463816
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.	28.759739473072585
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.	52.947790075513865
He is gone from mortal haunts: O ’ Dignam, sun of our morning.	75.90565128111064
Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow.	125.7170458039645
Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.	38.356323935804745
— There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.	84.4584609979819
— Who?	969.1116642327058
— Bloom, says he.	291.60570206971556
He ’ s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.	139.05610113499426
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.	63.60827257026331
Little Alf was knocked bawways.	32.46018530227839
Faith, he was.	943.0334928157355
— Good Christ! says he.	174.78602005667994
I could have sworn it was him.	100.36879461549172
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he ’ s under the influence: — Who said Christ is good?	117.1632034227531
— I beg your parsnips, says Alf.	152.75789339514523
— Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?	109.69627959990623
— Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.	101.35090253537508
He ’ s over all his troubles.	1056.5835492587637
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.	286.4450713956729
— He ’ s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.	113.73427863534238
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn ’ t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.	54.82293408828789
And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you ’ re there.	104.58135224847167
— The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.	99.55832677450114
Talking through his bloody hat.	182.8679609427842
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff ’ s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	48.92094120282508
— The noblest, the truest, says he.	188.25796891254464
And he ’ s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.	60.607500664020584
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.	41.52535510736469
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.	110.05236774140279
— Come in, come on, he won ’ t eat you, says the citizen.	176.40358438157332
So Bloom slopes in with his cod ’ s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.	113.7069933674944
— O, Christ M ’ Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters.	174.331711455358
Listen to this, will you?	40.78563870658377
And he starts reading out one.	48.0618528227501
_<NUM> Hunter Street, <URL> _To the High Sheriff of Dublin, <URL> _Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the <NUM> of Febuary <NUM> and i hanged... _ — Show us, Joe, says I.	26.018288132157014
private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when... _ — Jesus, says I.	18.799699624967033
— _...	475.0648350030777
Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith... _ The citizen made a grab at the letter.	42.967691760218244
— Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can ’ t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five <URL> _H.	44.384540808653284
Rumbold, Master <URL> — And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.	33.58805683930458
— And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe.	122.68265985135841
Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf.	42.055233871182956
Gob, he ’ s a prudent member and no mistake.	69.25088026490229
— Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.	42.85909256529836
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.	30.441576239223608
— They ’ re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.	25.936093815579653
And he was telling us there ’ s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.	27.142998417122904
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor.	191.41687289622553
Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.	14.977178076237783
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I ’ m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don ’ t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.	55.96760838898185
— There ’ s one thing it hasn ’ t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.	102.42156087702699
— What ’ s that?	399.7624183592977
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— The poor bugger ’ s tool that ’ s being hanged, says Alf.	147.41109802339454
— That so?	532.5800162132416
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— God ’ s truth, says Alf.	269.25572259895307
I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible.	201.65220982220418
He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.	409.26770252478235
— Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.	77.66489305304063
— That can be explained by science, says Bloom.	139.10130816726436
It ’ s only a natural phenomenon, don ’ t you see, because on account of the...	33.1164067270615
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.	66.33339067796597
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem <URL> So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other.	32.89908733544028
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought.	34.40816977090507
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs.	27.31792680613447
And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get.	123.38265273296344
Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs ’ tin he told Terry to bring.	57.82320453561328
Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more.	38.04637833791501
Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.	25.474383766001083
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she ’ s far from the land.	44.81102092026531
And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.	41.294115959376235
Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.	46.40715778311822
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk.	46.29244174061354
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.	24.294898898535532
And Bloom with his _but don ’ t you see? _ and _but on the other hand_.	80.83796920727248
And sure, more be token, the lout I ’ m told was in Power ’ s after, the blender ’ s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment.	84.3037925151011
Phenomenon! — The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.	41.869125671480965
— Ay, ay, says Joe.	73.43121422290305
— You don ’ t grasp my point, says Bloom.	230.93026063877457
What I mean is...	246.0351366832952
— _Sinn Fein! _ says the citizen.	426.9028312814069
_Sinn Fein amhain! _ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.	28.23200166335436
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.	105.78767195812793
The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.	34.05671401783779
A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons.	43.94120811261762
A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza ’ s plaintive muse.	18.616949242268134
Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L - n - h - n and M - ll - g - n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth - provoking fashion.	10.147042296101873
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies.	16.011979404621233
The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day ’ s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.	30.466197788321324
The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.	23.37847333476346
The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad - Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.	20.735492497670492
Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Señor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli - Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein.	4.541181724004522
All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness.	16.669676315330616
An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F.	33.48908330809452
O.	1594.4374175036246
T.	195.08478254618373
E.	189.06299250251155
I.	1818.0641127799029
as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland ’ s patron saint.	39.66561633318547
In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged.	10.482099965283169
The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties.	15.444603016664923
The readywitted ninefooter ’ s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted.	73.20937341346573
Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.	58.03715687779238
O.	1594.4374175036246
T.	195.08478254618373
E.	189.06299250251155
I., several of whom were bleeding profusely.	56.2785015834791
Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses.	28.59187023530078
The objects (which included several hundred ladies ’ and gentlemen ’ s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.	20.88772158441926
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus Cruentus_.	39.36352793703666
He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate — short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man.	22.493877684631492
The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.	14.331531180463436
It was exactly seventeen o ’ clock.	58.44591711390722
The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore ’ s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi.	36.27221353464356
The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.	26.794184110435598
Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously.	45.36776344001124
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.	18.52062798959989
On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim.	16.421455775579428
The housesteward of the amalgamated cats ’ and dogs ’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.	35.67467500254543
Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers ’ association as a token of his regard and esteem.	27.47542952195502
The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake.	29.922743739334308
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.	24.24876371451128
Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach.	24.739670070785678
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.	53.862610519491625
She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment.	64.10829053322728
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time.	28.983551500075304
A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself.	26.82114648279635
Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage.	45.67374501371756
Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion ’ s history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.	26.851369211420238
Nay, even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin - Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.	17.587160503157204
With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage, _ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone: — God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.	29.300895959002908
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can ’ t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.	60.5167413248032
Antitreating is about the size of it.	351.8055978664941
Gob, he ’ d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you ’ d ever see the froth of his pint.	47.21807283425987
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don ’ t be talking.	16.86935070276457
Ireland sober is Ireland free.	26.53972832781179
And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.	86.18680693847918
And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.	14.877723865659815
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me.	36.58102643385194
I ’ d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog.	66.11180907397483
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn ’ t blind him.	34.111353288045315
— Afraid he ’ ll bite you?	350.19317342294045
says the citizen, jeering.	52.16505018936577
— No, says I.	1636.0882893389796
But he might take my leg for a lamppost.	349.5845086411927
So he calls the old dog over.	85.59160624908232
— What ’ s on you, Garry?	461.6885064935648
says he.	192.4660005952656
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.	125.79011278113124
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.	25.806877128278092
Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that.	60.21601472086202
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.	77.93885497551526
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry.	16.85605965336779
The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.	26.655875620504357
Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards.	13.331720058528385
We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D.	35.11276503889637
O.	1594.4374175036246
C.	213.99259247746502
points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.	33.21667332856086
We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication.	22.91998754158455
The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught.	31.09858179585768
Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen ’ s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.	19.786839584778242
The curse of my curses Seven days every day And seven dry Thursdays On you, Barney Kiernan, Has no sup of water To cool my courage, And my guts red roaring After Lowry ’ s lights.	21.086739521082468
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off.	98.62062960342219
And Joe asked him would he have another.	64.95919760385611
— I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there ’ s no ill feeling.	110.39846663376464
Gob, he ’ s not as green as he ’ s cabbagelooking.	199.74386554863852
Entertainment for man and beast.	70.81376438900936
And says Joe: — Could you make a hole in another pint?	106.50975478048642
— Could a swim duck?	205.20777877214414
says I.	589.3102590128412
— Same again, Terry, says Joe.	243.47302015277702
Are you sure you won ’ t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment?	61.4324766369424
says he.	192.4660005952656
— Thank you, no, says Bloom.	3561.0066311040587
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don ’ t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam ’ s.	22.399239924414893
Martin asked me to go to the house.	99.83603851321541
You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn ’ t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can ’ t recover on the policy.	187.54936171341063
— Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that ’ s a good one if old Shylock is landed.	52.29738897127007
So the wife comes out top dog, what?	68.47740312643388
— Whose admirers?	804.7254478854799
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— The wife ’ s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.	312.09523375192305
He was bloody safe he wasn ’ t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court.	71.90286297005898
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery.	25.219195306003613
O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.	30.250695137604367
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that ’ s dead to tell her.	66.0107061630571
Choking with bloody foolery.	69.81804203787918
And shaking Bloom ’ s hand doing the tragic to tell her that.	70.03625936543939
Shake hands, brother.	118.79715320496292
You ’ re a rogue and I ’ m another.	53.084457858608104
— Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour.	64.92105632106498
But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.	21.93223666769835
— No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.	38.64929855055573
— Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.	89.58188228603173
The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.	28.609045984809256
And off with him and out trying to walk straight.	214.70801679487076
Boosed at five o ’ clock.	33.62577127874525
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, <NUM> A.	80.08165075098103
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups.	24.424382902992363
And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve ’ s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging.	100.50808907675089
And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.	43.273415795583894
_How is your testament?	94.11515036899259
Have you got an old testament? _ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what.	76.64882940352729
Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady.	81.59137731529059
Jack Mooney ’ s sister.	280.82352834460863
And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples.	55.46325158074229
Gob, Jack made him toe the line.	118.18518860557673
Told him if he didn ’ t patch up the pot, Jesus, he ’ d kick the shite out of him.	97.55191043907341
So Terry brought the three pints.	103.34745590163625
— Here, says Joe, doing the honours.	88.42324038656847
Here, citizen.	130.9293632812747
— _Slan leat_, says he.	164.73697238034728
— Fortune, Joe, says I.	215.24807958978795
Good health, citizen.	102.83071807401676
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already.	164.60599906973584
Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.	91.76124300188523
— Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf?	101.87184773839851
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Friend of yours, says Alf.	163.36647640095634
— Nannan?	2901.269617769212
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
The mimber?	1473.6388010057888
— I won ’ t mention any names, says Alf.	161.13150520940616
— I thought so, says Joe.	597.3279867754163
I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M.	59.2234713524939
P., the cattle traders.	504.0680181047143
— Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.	192.5833511236025
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.	60.8365178075133
Because he was up one time in a knacker ’ s yard.	85.28403899601739
Walking about with his book and pencil here ’ s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier.	34.76707993257601
Mister Knowall.	275.29382542023205
Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks.	39.1970941710489
Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O ’ Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her.	36.98301961817162
Couldn ’ t loosen her farting strings but old cod ’ s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it.	22.36281335469609
What ’ s your programme today?	201.87384419548437
Ay. Humane methods.	49.273022935304326
Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn ’ t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently.	42.164970053102174
Gob, he ’ d have a soft hand under a hen.	99.16672255831256
Klook Klook Klook.	12.236078813427431
Black Liz is our hen.	37.37378392599176
She lays eggs for us.	112.09543035460617
When she lays her egg she is so glad.	47.26399007642805
Gara.	1218.4197832253003
Klook Klook Klook.	12.236078813427431
Then comes good uncle Leo.	104.37296677864013
He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg.	44.86372344949883
Ga ga ga ga Gara.	49.57160796307506
— Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going?	311.0662969515838
I wanted to see him, as it happens.	460.079863558075
— Well, he ’ s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.	358.54871377048175
— That ’ s too bad, says Bloom.	279.8722820139369
I wanted particularly.	654.90528771527
Perhaps only Mr Field is going.	131.6906743577591
I couldn ’ t phone.	613.4686074187828
No. You ’ re sure?	144.5150996372789
— Nannan ’ s going too, says Joe.	220.11540754412925
The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park.	50.99393259726876
What do you think of that, citizen?	201.66468726462185
_The Sluagh na h - Eireann_.	23.90763528458454
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham.	36.084839147349264
Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?	19.60508192213805
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.	74.39029153243072
Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house.	48.71061234172439
I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that.	87.16314101352948
The answer to the honourable member ’ s question is in the affirmative.	398.1426043530712
Mr Orelli O ’ Reilly (Montenotte.	90.29593830879872
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?	28.516278449112512
Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman ’ s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench?	29.8144676753149
(O! O!) Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.	276.4082157786486
Mr Staylewit (Buncombe.	66.2742153683287
Ind.): Don ’ t hesitate to shoot.	71.10629614025211
(Ironical opposition cheers.) The speaker: Order! Order! (The house rises.	41.00469884152139
Cheers.) — There ’ s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival.	299.7614997507767
There he is sitting there.	78.62579618359078
The man that got away James Stephens.	37.67002515778281
The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot.	31.514758391500983
What was your best throw, citizen?	206.99570520287648
— _Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest.	57.35738960786782
There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.	55.11286802928631
— Put it there, citizen, says Joe.	84.32503990871275
You were and a bloody sight better.	118.19972347022637
— Is that really a fact?	387.6674995101689
says Alf.	90.63091556479291
— Yes, says Bloom.	508.94944895451175
Did you not know that?	88.20838034707725
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that.	18.298299201701415
And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower ’ s heart violent exercise was bad.	72.92325195545256
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.	104.31502148047795
Do you see that straw?	207.29967101343726
That ’ s a straw_.	150.95849816939503
Declare to my aunt he ’ d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.	173.15234451821362
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian O ’ Ciarnain ’ s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of _Sluagh na h - Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.	27.37924891410026
The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions.	111.24295559476083
After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers.	30.817086155072825
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M ’ Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages.	24.28705338878874
L.	195.29848232727008
Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis ’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.	16.763150946578126
The Irish Caruso - Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it.	35.70315380424637
His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions.	39.01623218611337

— Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh - Bennett match?	29.184154266988045
— No, says Joe.	513.197097164545
— I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.	104.95054733968
— Who?	969.1116642327058
Blazes?	1225.7415950805032
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
And says Bloom: — What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.	58.31857069606787
— Ay, Blazes, says Alf.	144.33539262442457
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.	189.30167196235175
— We know him, says the citizen.	386.5372140934648
The traitor ’ s son.	499.1839282431324
We know what put English gold in his pocket.	256.20087796127683
— True for you, says Joe.	199.61816194783611
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf: — Now, don ’ t you think, Bergan?	67.02665464926476
Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it.	26.841796921784724
Handed him the father and mother of a beating.	57.45315751262116
See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping.	36.90733458322736
God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.	147.01333179042427
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.	20.07790288335438
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin ’ s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.	59.04952110977663
The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions.	37.040306549830646
The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet ’ s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.	43.407561313327214
The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett ’ s jaw.	44.25859479478763
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.	43.237950657572696
The men came to handigrips.	624.4517094386154
Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him.	34.17844055777751
The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime.	15.1826825584348
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.	136.1660231993017
The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.	22.976589124570566
The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.	16.0576794402279
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent ’ s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett ’ s stomach, flooring him flat.	18.198466573968886
Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett ’ s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.	31.039134106452053
— He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.	51.3539682918606
— He is, says Joe.	132.73453375540151
Isn ’ t he?	151.7560786783118
— Who?	969.1116642327058
says Bloom.	1194.259195168467
Ah, yes.	184.5073741098551
That ’ s quite true.	30.33495707567917
Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see.	83.38573678254534
Just a holiday.	62.91447769874334
— Mrs B.	754.9863347230494
is the bright particular star, isn ’ t she?	70.61956173590991
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— My wife?	615.7871063697752
says Bloom.	1194.259195168467
She ’ s singing, yes.	685.6211173132525
I think it will be a success too.	82.50020924024955

Ay, and done says I.	515.3795550064076
Gob, he ’ ll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I ’ m thinking.	58.97427500026766
— Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there?	46.38561524573805
says Alf.	90.63091556479291

And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.	43.58126290116154
— Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing.	81.38294159279911
God, I ’ d give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.	81.23456621424319
— Was it you did it, Alf?	355.26821964399727
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.	55.687310725262364
— Me?	2901.269617769212
says Alf.	90.63091556479291
Don ’ t cast your nasturtiums on my character.	47.77284973503084
— Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.	89.0960026920515
— Of course an action would lie, says J.	50.45296557036528
J.	129.7375304578709
It implies that he is not _compos mentis_.	94.45679990238696
U.	195.00677118397383
p: up.	40.11532574640197
_ — Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing.	19.769552355397614
Do you know that he ’ s balmy?	726.9151122672849
Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.	109.56791780640701
— Yes, says J.	158.56613180251875
J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.	79.67221280248764
— Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.	121.60085869079178
— Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.	182.5039100193303
— Pity about her, says the citizen.	121.75272712358526
Or any other woman marries a half and half.	69.20955633031471
— How half and half?	207.14588649183068
says Bloom.	1194.259195168467
Do you mean he...	105.74526044700843
— Half and half I mean, says the citizen.	22.56225406700425
A fellow that ’ s neither fish nor flesh.	121.64520450035145
— Nor good red herring, says Joe.	74.47875748018899
A pishogue, if you know what that is.	673.4369739732705
Begob I saw there was trouble coming.	411.18882292611084
And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool.	85.82934063004633
Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain.	49.83011132929907
And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow ’ s was pewopener to the pope.	77.13564563100822
Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney ’ s moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.	66.7425558775815
And who was he, tell us?	196.52029571651912
A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.	47.52735688570766
— And moreover, says J.	405.4519591585557
J., a postcard is publication.	62.95752783033954
It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v.	71.24066644515447
Hole.	1218.4197832253003
In my opinion an action might lie.	47.272183354446746
Six and eightpence, please.	171.88841985065815
Who wants your opinion?	261.4772617028472
Let us drink our pints in peace.	43.04021144726937
Gob, we won ’ t be let even do that much itself.	48.05206654331623
— Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.	168.42072191202874
— Good health, Ned, says J.	127.20063932615963
J.	129.7375304578709
— - There he is again, says Joe.	80.28281251157073
— Where?	2270.024853775706
says Alf.	90.63091556479291
And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.	69.48638234389018
— How did that Canada swindle case go off?	68.10439266754531
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Remanded, says J.	282.3509526331542
J.	129.7375304578709
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he ’ d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob.	30.2509079837822
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?	144.4839652333528
Course it was a bloody barney.	83.15528968195714
What?	1560.489681896445
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too.	27.934940988034114
J.	129.7375304578709
J.	129.7375304578709
was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.	146.8275596576954
— Who tried the case?	413.3599467424694
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Recorder, says Ned.	279.9703351757526
— Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.	78.35448923159177
— Heart as big as a lion, says Ned.	154.6342134459091
— Ay, says Alf.	143.45181290336578
Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn ’ t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that ’ s minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.	67.24410923804662
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry: — A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?	38.92924293198758
Ten, did you say?	342.3275493534637
— Yes, your worship.	377.5537686892816
And my wife has the typhoid.	131.52318036552535
— And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir.	37.946359720871506
No, sir, I ’ ll make no order for payment.	137.5923633616991
How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.	50.456499568785674
And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law.	114.42418172309591
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.	27.298569094482325
And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.	48.812417376737315
And he sat him there about the hour of five o ’ clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin.	94.86879265254176
And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true.	34.0763644796546
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book.	30.035189270198295
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness.	36.156140585728615
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received.	21.18035907701619
And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.	36.02776575527542
— Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.	27.39413988722843
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn ’ t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford.	47.988233384918665
And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he ’ d do the devil and all.	93.71353571352381
— Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition.	205.07506157849124
That ’ s the whole secret.	133.252621732477
— Rely on me, says Joe.	684.7671035901918
— Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland.	149.2193396392462
We want no more strangers in our house.	195.10010908812416
— O, I ’ m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom.	106.06845669576188
It ’ s just that Keyes, you see.	44.35957792129236
— Consider that done, says Joe.	126.45743040394972
— Very kind of you, says Bloom.	524.9846751865574
— The strangers, says the citizen.	92.17702177280425
Our own fault.	88.86147365512089
We let them come in.	165.01327213047225
We brought them in.	409.55378079197726
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.	44.630305992188596
— Decree _nisi, _ says J.	150.19506990285993
J.	129.7375304578709
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider ’ s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.	85.5147838842869
— A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that ’ s what ’ s the cause of all our misfortunes.	137.96018803995483
— And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_ with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.	98.31587068179243

Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?	37.59052656821547
So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.	48.33681849363417
— Well, says the citizen, what ’ s the latest from the scene of action?	77.35615357795722
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?	61.43745351886651
O ’ Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.	33.70124902389106
— It ’ s on the march, says the citizen.	192.09322790335145
To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their <URL> So J.	47.803882039339406
J.	129.7375304578709
puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.	18.55132035296846
— Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen.	73.9661683413315
To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores ’ gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name.	33.878528729864456
Any civilisation they have they stole from us.	21.95398081029526
Tonguetied sons of bastards ’ ghosts.	39.42718437859002
— The European family, says J.	97.43045987717615

— They ’ re not European, says the citizen.	41.96346380942194
I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris.	77.00708449554011
You wouldn ’ t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d ’ <URL> And says John Wyse: — Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.	31.491497426816093
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo: — _Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion! _ He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.	44.74046078945414
— What ’ s up with you, says I to Lenehan.	726.1675100495177
You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.	154.14228824379748

— Who won, Mr Lenehan?	660.590492430119
says Terry.	199.14617800886296

The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley.	23.33350247806439
Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey - Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence.	9.916417017144333
The bride who was given away by her father, the M ’ Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze.	21.88781305063108
The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.	27.004027992111414
Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of _Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service.	47.75680854124717
On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.	11.532741698152995
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.	31.528157238145695
— And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.	92.30809528421547
We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.	31.45660416721462
— And will again, says Joe.	222.3719324040973
— And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh.	87.7790886118123
Our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O ’ Reillys and the O ’ Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.	39.12899204071703
And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor ’ s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.	65.45561245001959
And he took the last swig out of the pint.	175.35486075474878

What will you have?	818.0204565919931
— An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.	78.36852687373089
— Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.	47.35773567286772
Terry! Are you asleep?	85.36517976254184
— Yes, sir, says Terry.	338.2512061096756
Small whisky and bottle of Allsop.	28.431786458591983

Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.	98.81613580650485
— But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?	94.4807639721685
— I ’ ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.	322.5376023328764
Hell upon earth it is.	79.53122750005225
Read the revelations that ’ s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth.	44.19816392550386
A fellow writes that calls himself _Disgusted One_.	27.630026521045384
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.	38.42868921157407
— A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God ’ s Englishman calls it caning on the breech.	45.281487622484754
And says John Wyse: — ’ Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.	103.02596980188463
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.	59.28392209730576
— That ’ s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.	70.79170312327808
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God ’ s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.	54.32541582822027
That ’ s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.	20.279972039045173
— On which the sun never rises, says Joe.	86.01718637020501
— And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.	178.17182575531012
The unfortunate yahoos believe it.	110.76744340112334
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.	22.681183724531994
— But, says Bloom, isn ’ t discipline the same everywhere.	241.76072200515074
I mean wouldn ’ t it be the same here if you put force against force?	173.08181100335906
Didn ’ t I tell you?	35.593798857164764
As true as I ’ m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he ’ d try to downface you that dying was living.	24.745443911289634
— We ’ ll put force against force, says the citizen.	102.88082924080348
We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea.	32.7381670914842
They were driven out of house and home in the black <NUM>.	77.62080514566388
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America.	18.087048468927822
Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres.	16.183409354762297
But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.	28.244126727066305
Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes.	55.159872510185316
Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships.	159.2619083711386
But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage.	361.7299824375943
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.	62.05938039973357
— Perfectly true, says Bloom.	546.6286905267473
But my point was...	146.2861669907004
— We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned.	324.54952446667016
— Ay, says John Wyse.	93.52743684571578
We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us.	59.11647648571841
Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone.	132.76050305311495
We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese.	55.45394029296266
Fontenoy, eh?	129.61284589109073
And Sarsfield and O ’ Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa.	29.495768581097682
But what did we ever get for it?	82.2126069130865
— The French! says the citizen.	85.40107123723422
Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is?	217.12077528946674
They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.	31.381074747679893
— _Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.	57.97454224048509
— And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven ’ t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that ’ s dead?	104.3630611476306
Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.	35.76454275288612
— Well, says J.	124.45937579555503

We have Edward the peacemaker now.	67.05772100414764
— Tell that to a fool, says the citizen.	151.06158740134424
Edward Guelph - Wettin! — And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty ’ s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode.	44.85268585147469
The earl of Dublin, no less.	382.4903068185493
— They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.	84.5411429035111
And says J.	239.95735100194335
J.: — Considerations of space influenced their lordships ’ decision.	44.05638488001176
— Will you try another, citizen?	106.34698521306828
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Yes, sir, says he.	254.50462338415744
I will.	346.0507017077635
— You?	3728.498514250075
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
— Beholden to you, Joe, says I.	385.5775140063017
May your shadow never grow less.	23.37153228963448
— Repeat that dose, says Joe.	97.91139576695437
— Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.	302.3932089463812
Perpetuating national hatred among nations.	40.66534266626026
— But do you know what a nation means?	305.02852748480916
says John Wyse.	86.28554931736538
— Yes, says Bloom.	508.94944895451175
— What is it?	608.0440085668911
says John Wyse.	86.28554931736538
— A nation?	721.5971199011982
says Bloom.	1194.259195168467
A nation is the same people living in the same place.	182.24336383225256
— By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that ’ s so I ’ m a nation for I ’ m living in the same place for the past five years.	102.67352263651566
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it: — Or also living in different places.	116.87016782608848
— What is your nation if I may ask?	310.6330648021564
says the citizen.	46.9538148228659
— Ireland, says Bloom.	1460.8461851915404
Ireland.	450.1580569258809
The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.	55.28909144697631
— After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.	24.26213133004121
— Here you are, citizen, says Joe.	46.47481023409341
Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.	60.573597578305076
The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration.	14.129414464449045
No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill.	26.02363595204394
The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides.	32.23927695111308
Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland ’ s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh ’ s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde ’ s tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun ’ s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch ’ s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury ’ s Hotel, S.	33.47471509399572
Patrick ’ s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley ’ s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal ’ s Cave — all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.	66.69001215033933
— Show us over the drink, says I.	198.80082670822654
Which is which?	71.84736571408452
— That ’ s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.	144.41610013578332
Also now.	281.1286949984827
This very moment.	79.2800032640868
This very instant.	78.39026347282187
Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.	89.95299678586413
— Robbed, says he.	289.5946350000984
Plundered.	1218.4197832253003
Insulted.	1218.4197832253003
Persecuted.	1218.4197832253003
Taking what belongs to us by right.	10.789820125271733
At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.	22.180680924676455
— Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?	382.602929957906
says the citizen.	46.9538148228659
— I ’ m talking about injustice, says Bloom.	242.33958756092065
— Right, says John Wyse.	96.27223589299078
Stand up to it then with force like men.	18.734243257302925
That ’ s an almanac picture for you.	40.59902716820698
Mark for a softnosed bullet.	51.18475854691029
Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun.	83.49137068024481
Gob, he ’ d adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse ’ s apron on him.	48.536744540412236
And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.	91.03776581567072
— But it ’ s no use, says he.	164.25013341614772
Force, hatred, history, all that.	36.55157988363736
That ’ s not life for men and women, insult and hatred.	28.547087751665757
And everybody knows that it ’ s the very opposite of that that is really life.	271.15153161955357
— What?	1096.145065448642
says Alf.	90.63091556479291
— Love, says Bloom.	983.7963211463532
I mean the opposite of hatred.	94.49495736274163
I must go now, says he to John Wyse.	62.975767788142875
Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there.	60.88713436423084
If he comes just say I ’ ll be back in a second.	58.12569948498932
Just a moment.	43.53866196320489
Who ’ s hindering you?	528.2169831006937
And off he pops like greased lightning.	40.196929118990106
— A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen.	88.01908667427797
Universal love.	275.29382542023205
— Well, says John Wyse.	84.4761676454487
Isn ’ t that what we ’ re told.	79.70369042959159
Love your neighbour.	84.52039968119486
— That chap?	1041.1844638521488
says the citizen.	46.9538148228659
Beggar my neighbour is his motto.	38.634220902152485
Love, moya! He ’ s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.	36.815513242415314
Love loves to love love.	41.65086023472299
Nurse loves the new chemist.	62.04660687361587
Constable <NUM> A loves Mary Kelly.	24.597786587341812
Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.	34.421083005915676
M.	220.98386498097403
B.	192.1781670529122
loves a fair gentleman.	116.43270970583471
Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye.	21.481387027599627
The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead.	78.71212913538558
His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen.	77.07734459693059
Mrs Norman W.	111.75908512486471
Tupper loves officer Taylor.	47.95886141701586
You love a certain person.	222.7942852441126
And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.	16.974382445636575
— Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song.	68.51143241931469
More power, citizen.	55.37890652480049
— Hurrah, there, says Joe.	435.0213080756125
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.	39.11668464242316
— We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.	54.252265890308365
What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_ pasted round the mouth of his cannon?	40.790930910141064
The bible! Did you read that skit in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that ’ s visiting England?	49.06548626980458
— What ’ s that?	399.7624183592977
says Joe.	81.51791678686418
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out: — A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions.	23.620913317664932
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England ’ s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor.	42.972465352281695
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors ’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.	22.340494681999576
— Widow woman, says Ned.	247.14350354344526
I wouldn ’ t doubt her.	328.8084870621092
Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.	201.1876697754344
— Same only more so, says Lenehan.	64.21701132632064
And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.	28.785772728087185
— Is that by Griffith?	904.2051716124394
says John Wyse.	86.28554931736538
— No, says the citizen.	287.9753626488806
It ’ s not signed Shanganagh.	79.05419547237497
It ’ s only initialled: P.	41.78530697203864
— And a very good initial too, says Joe.	114.46598083407926
— That ’ s how it ’ s worked, says the citizen.	168.47238130516584
Trade follows the flag.	74.69924435094208
— Well, says J.	124.45937579555503
J., if they ’ re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad.	44.32305725284205
Did you read that report by a man what ’ s this his name is?	34.53149293847494
— Casement, says the citizen.	159.2558150955696
He ’ s an Irishman.	335.0628912161579
— Yes, that ’ s the man, says J.	480.09754124829243
J.	129.7375304578709
Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.	39.75059136761523
— I know where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.	144.54330269386912
— Who?	969.1116642327058
says I.	589.3102590128412
— Bloom, says he.	291.60570206971556
The courthouse is a blind.	258.7656156866176
He had a few bob on _Throwaway_ and he ’ s gone to gather in the shekels.	155.19890689846386
— Is it that whiteeyed kaffir?	118.41890329465832
says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?	81.66417133632125
— That ’ s where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan.	209.38046216448296
I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.	63.14675112420955
He ’ s the only man in Dublin has it.	275.3235492477346
A dark horse.	337.8414702807322
— He ’ s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.	129.96894938860007
— Mind, Joe, says I.	225.1671240815527
Show us the entrance out.	37.50857331516573
— There you are, says Terry.	357.2297516994312
Goodbye Ireland I ’ m going to Gort.	34.18109460830072
So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my _ (Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery ’ s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she ’ s better_ or _she ’ s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there ’ s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.	37.80610836104708
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries.	27.84722819047677
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.	67.99956093016266
Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.	85.63025014757218
Give us a bloody chance.	42.18785104692703
God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout.	81.00489077523498
Mr Bloom with his argol bargol.	100.11233389477943
And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds.	33.437157781981675
Loans by post on easy terms.	41.65062945000022
Any amount of money advanced on note of hand.	23.214548044659676
Distance no object.	101.55103292581168
No security.	1344.0689515154133
Gob, he ’ s like Lanty MacHale ’ s goat that ’ d go a piece of the road with every one.	110.48884885399092
— Well, it ’ s a fact, says John Wyse.	148.00470767729038
And there ’ s the man now that ’ ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.	608.9451055477412
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general ’ s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king ’ s expense.	55.78833058896667
Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.	15.748495686109539
— Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.	64.36366553618812
Saucy knave! To us! So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.	18.027272661744274
Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.	46.51459055174269
— Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.	52.033352944121994
— Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked.	51.00377569832589
Look to our steeds.	69.02020224009922
— Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder.	37.287813990485354
I know not what to offer your lordships.	55.56302441852661
— How now, fellow?	319.5874086669886
cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king ’ s messengers, master Taptun?	21.3662213744801
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord ’ s visage.	139.18037944569937
— Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly.	269.65386619420553
An you be the king ’ s messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught.	56.56611641769059
The king ’ s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.	48.59432329382743
— Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect.	37.50330633896079
Hast aught to give us?	89.45163074668271
Mine host bowed again as he made answer: — What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog ’ s bacon, a boar ’ s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?	32.472303105353305
— Gadzooks! cried the last speaker.	195.47881036352553
That likes me well.	72.30671542895612
Pistachios! — Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance.	109.51665664620205
A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! ’ Tis a merry rogue.	30.90217420752494
So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.	53.148273868558796
— Where is he?	167.41924009116752
says Lenehan.	321.7092935221222
Defrauding widows and orphans.	62.200804154614865
— Isn ’ t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?	165.8997534742973
— That ’ s so, says Martin.	142.53632360808666
Or so they allege.	228.00881817884192
— I, says Joe.	1091.5290604592524
I ’ m the alligator.	72.65259321832006
— And after all, says John Wyse, why can ’ t a jew love his country like the next fellow?	122.36817165307838
— Why not?	966.8492475166474
says J.	205.75830960265031
— Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he?	59.066355342353205
says Ned.	201.41690087348442
Or who is he?	238.05366275457445
No offence, Crofton.	200.932899308821
— Who is Junius?	397.7400861289775
says J.	205.75830960265031
— We don ’ t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.	232.35345866922034
— He ’ s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system.	87.89460885519742
We know that in the castle.	627.3570533325062
— Isn ’ t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist?	142.80459115498692
says Jack Power.	160.6852744978106
— Not at all, says Martin.	79.13391262770276
Only namesakes.	171.97790624687732
His name was Virag, the father ’ s name that poisoned himself.	161.27676405822822
He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.	192.05398837082208
— That ’ s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen.	68.81591728032859
Island of saints and sages! — Well, they ’ re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin.	41.55689460678267
For that matter so are we.	43.01583160556244
— Yes, says J.	158.56613180251875
J., and every male that ’ s born they think it may be their Messiah.	62.85655435866063
And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he ’ s a father or a mother.	51.310998562334994
— Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.	71.47539271752666
— O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born.	71.81460139456205
I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave ’ s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.	46.58984749038918
— _En ventre sa mère_, says J.	73.46677861484049
J.	129.7375304578709
— Do you call that a man?	3268.8792280582543
says the citizen.	46.9538148228659
— I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.	199.51314638994273
— Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.	160.19504029338543
— And who does he suspect?	503.17461998036185
says the citizen.	46.9538148228659
Gob, there ’ s many a true word spoken in jest.	71.27486129920153
One of those mixed middlings he is.	21.057175212996608
Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses.	44.187002148091246
Do you know what I ’ m telling you?	46.632837761777466
It ’ d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea.	70.88727937195165
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man.	28.35658229642899
Give us your blessing.	78.79456193020293
— Charity to the neighbour, says Martin.	318.43159959284986
But where is he?	225.1400830344679
We can ’ t wait.	778.482596977141
— A wolf in sheep ’ s clothing, says the citizen.	91.11450818641195
That ’ s what he is.	155.16811531360304
Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him.	18.546753852700764
Cursed by God.	188.30306034673075
— Have you time for a brief libation, Martin?	169.20481215717882
says Ned.	201.41690087348442
— Only one, says Martin.	197.80869972368149

Three half ones, Terry.	67.49694939840482
— Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.	34.591591035276416
— Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass.	54.393159186203654
God bless all here is my prayer.	43.31291850418068
— Amen, says the citizen.	136.77970036782125
— And I ’ m sure He will, says Joe.	106.82265025822919
And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S.	16.90061338741073

And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags ’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns.	5.728790539582796
And as they wended their way by Nelson ’ s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying.	11.773603590716906
And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O ’ Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick.	23.192570669109326
And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein.	39.50406303221327
And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.	139.21125903788376
— _Adiutorium nostrum in nomine <URL> — _Qui fecit cœlum et <URL> — _Dominus <URL> — _Et cum spiritu <URL> And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed: — _Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum <URL> — And so say all of us, says Jack.	14.300038246623348
— Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.	94.16164329228873
— Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson.	63.51822197758077
And butter for fish.	175.18220446728057
I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.	35.729656454596025
— I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you.	242.41184687929353
I hope I ’ m not...	109.81364899486876
— No, says Martin, we ’ re ready.	222.16384352875195
Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.	24.476995030753994
Mean bloody scut.	112.77067707425105
Stand us a drink itself.	20.401400469114943
Devil a sweet fear! There ’ s a jew for you! All for number one.	38.10312519281392
Cute as a shithouse rat.	239.42585441478988
Hundred to five.	84.91314399640892
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen.	70.80062275273677
— Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue.	233.32473709102928
Come along now.	139.0442600661703
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him.	36.715761348043756
It ’ s a secret.	179.17533278421092
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.	61.83438785272214
— Bye bye all, says Martin.	127.76467963545961
And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.	293.2979897044257
— Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.	425.1131849676434
The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard.	42.80055545945618
A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair.	26.836610906440832
Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.	47.719412503391545
And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.	40.64952589262907
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.	49.4914384630727
— Let me alone, says he.	439.163278404336
And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him: — Three cheers for Israel! Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ ’ sake and don ’ t be making a public exhibition of yourself.	65.15997574992385
Jesus, there ’ s always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing.	48.672318353693285
Gob, it ’ d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.	76.38252210558663
And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her: — Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister! And says he: — Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza.	57.199862618175075
And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew.	188.92434072062727
Your God.	134.65649658216878
— He had no father, says Martin.	310.4799530652203
That ’ ll do now.	108.22036775381451
Drive ahead.	275.29382542023205
— Whose God?	804.7254478854799
says the citizen.	46.9538148228659
— Well, his uncle was a jew, says he.	225.36742168889236
Your God was a jew.	143.70250689536235
Christ was a jew like me.	62.309839649040875
Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.	287.18011540897885
— By Jesus, says he, I ’ ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.	107.67274185675723
By Jesus, I ’ ll crucify him so I will.	76.05712847483825
Give us that biscuitbox here.	34.342422974009466
— Stop! Stop! says Joe.	191.9025709369296
The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was characterised by the most affecting cordiality.	54.615971281970644
An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.	52.01040048801181
The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_, followed immediately by _Rakóczsy ’ s March_.	26.548118545662057
Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M ’ Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.	41.51906071130305
Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.	24.73565764242914
_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra! _ Gone but not forgotten.	36.79031927438671
And Ned and J.	180.33598456336188
J.	129.7375304578709
paralysed with the laughing.	135.72758865596902
— Bloody wars, says I, I ’ ll be in for the last gospel.	134.07361555133784
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag ’ s head round the other way and off with him.	86.72856943512961
— Hold on, citizen, says Joe.	86.47771156034986
Stop! Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly.	22.563723217788198
Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he ’ d have left him for dead.	158.28386929157256
Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford.	108.77167014927687
The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.	46.69349408392351
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect.	108.85411906148956
The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli ’ s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of <NUM>, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas.	59.12644682279705
The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn ’ s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch.	21.220790895666553
All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.	40.62786086915219
From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character.	14.056009643558241
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant ’ s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale.	34.04699464263937
Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west.	15.32692624192158
Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.	30.68877879387139
The work of salvage, removal of _débris, _ human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, <NUM> Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T.	25.092131926195922

— Did I kill him, says he, or what?	114.07257391836696
And he shouting to the bloody dog: — After him, Garry! After him, boy! And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.	59.04394094015938
Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.	310.19768033754025
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven.	52.92901327279676
And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him.	41.817815093042064
And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah! Elijah! _ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai! _ And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe ’ s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.	24.40292553586883
The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.	115.39551625126101
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.	37.520105527929964
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.	32.11647317921678
Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _H.	20.111262354125092
M.	220.98386498097403
S.	189.6702203090223
Belleisle_ printed on both.	114.55391109580113
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.	8.107910474789131
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long.	30.964390395962003
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight.	26.23997280309559
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.	41.31597547004203
Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.	112.67676102905473
— Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.	77.22071205399068
Say out big, big.	48.51531091310354
I want a drink of water.	179.69430040723356
And baby prattled after her: — A jink a jink a jawbo.	45.647943705793175
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on.	19.13706204774286
What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib.	24.907562922896105
None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.	24.74633677759379
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.	31.421288600602455
And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.	78.66788797938861
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky.	126.70195929984698
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule.	25.770200632496802
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had.	25.436185997584843
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman ’ s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too.	38.6180967782658
— Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.	186.89169682451143
At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.	144.83108831270675
Wait till I catch you for that.	24.817028411527556
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister ’ s word was law with the twins.	25.428031737933008
And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure.	98.65087315964644
His little man - o ’ - war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life ’ s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.	25.957123811269764
Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn ’ t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.	21.74782320837649
— Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.	261.22925381119387
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly: — What ’ s your name?	55.70692599601518
Butter and cream?	169.8679623667528
Is Cissy your sweetheart?	68.29168374377224
— Nao, tearful Tommy said.	106.09145370796601
Cissy queried.	2099.294114381785
— Nao, Tommy said.	140.49530830852348
— I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes.	32.337755161612776
I know who is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	257.70871455155964
Gerty is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	131.15942743015017
— Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.	135.80289451485194
Cissy ’ s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn ’ t see and to mind he didn ’ t wet his new tan shoes.	74.22717950184354
But who was Gerty?	460.40750725445855
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see.	25.574155373670752
She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.	37.91397173958566
Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch ’ s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling.	24.890376715917807
The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid ’ s bow, Greekly perfect.	36.62399906037474
Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.	16.497743720885385
Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she ’ d never speak to her again.	38.33405585081501
No. Honour where honour is due.	41.63638101627679
There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.	16.26556744275027
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.	23.41410346005811
Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist.	53.00452390165683
Why have women such eyes of witchery?	71.87750198312523
Gerty ’ s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows.	43.42151835896961
Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive.	22.329118083479514
It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.	41.37462793066342
Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?	66.02573824891087
That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one.	52.93529530501391
But Gerty ’ s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.	65.86071956272225
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it.	70.26204871095705
She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.	20.374682696415892
And just now at Edy ’ s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God ’ s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.	35.58414035246793
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.	35.70840253732941
She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.	42.56669388610795
Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.	74.7977240388237
She knew right well, no - one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers ’ quarrel.	39.578547144733136
As per usual somebody ’ s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window.	58.03227202927673
Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W.	121.75727336574488
E.	189.06299250251155
Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.	64.8853019403755
Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core.	35.65678226562602
Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time.	89.14162841725195
They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph.	70.28505853940551
But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn ’ t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.	47.939144693994315
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out.	72.29005287532749
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the _Lady ’ s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection.	23.535636335016573
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.	19.279083587907934
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery ’ s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.	23.47493434453756
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.	61.1857294412189
Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep.	16.87556158359655
Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops.	12.605692354724058
As for undies they were Gerty ’ s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her?	20.012335987182826
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn ’ t trust those washerwomen as far as she ’ d see them scorching the things.	19.857885898623472
She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers ’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn ’ t of a Friday.	44.67573644390406
And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time.	51.32366263557357
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror.	35.118468387170516
You are lovely, Gerty, it said.	114.59852441919696
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.	31.248428745802876
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.	43.00977787835815
C.	213.99259247746502
D.	194.5521629100558
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be.	34.85866076968774
He was too young to understand.	146.40670396608562
He would not believe in love, a woman ’ s birthright.	173.10792344650773
The night of the party long ago in Stoer ’ s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.	45.85032390179359
He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments.	49.046383654364284
Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie ’ s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.	31.142078650080602
But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over.	37.98487442796284
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss.	27.80287236228536
It would be like heaven.	64.52469946115846
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve.	20.820556246729904
With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.	37.85733707354486
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be.	36.48437009861759
Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November.	55.472051450681114
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess.	23.38071056904486
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann ’ s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn ’ t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn ’ t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap ’ s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery ’ s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.	21.868917178537973
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.	38.95397087902171
But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there ’ d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please.	61.9924091147862
The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.	130.45874589701643
Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.	102.62491312152513
— You ’ re not my sister, naughty Tommy said.	36.42180588272038
It ’ s my ball.	117.20262178919307
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.	50.193243341524386
— Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.	263.77790022862234
And she tickled tiny tot ’ s two cheeks to make him forget and played here ’ s the lord mayor, here ’ s his two horses, here ’ s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin.	28.563309481649327
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.	28.63211387236069
— I ’ d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won ’ t say.	89.80494997973815
— On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.	86.24563639331993
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she ’ d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.	23.714695462198698
But not a pin cared Ciss.	140.72719527181806
— Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose.	61.25158027261077
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I ’ d look at him.	107.17938670384682
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls.	53.32036615625777
You had to laugh at her sometimes.	89.8558483142372
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men ’ s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White.	25.67784585404949
That was just like Cissycums.	939.5915470474273
O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father ’ s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.	65.22627190787044
There was none to come up to her for fun.	97.50766010107793
But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.	47.858351456830306
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ.	193.60876367081443
It was the men ’ s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.	119.9011774972062
J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament.	35.02860630019784
They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins.	21.157766187213674
How sad to poor Gerty ’ s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson ’ s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none.	26.8914907887111
Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.	54.843506687447324
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days.	13.858308612640904
Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.	47.9164130441145
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful.	28.742837359408874
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.	15.996840388711727
You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.	51.44149839441317
Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby ’ s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.	18.198224868023722
Her mother ’ s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.	50.31689725866143
No - one would have thought the end was so near.	110.14425924372148
Now he was laid to rest.	450.588733875771
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn ’ t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby ’ s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.	69.52864570597265
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold.	37.88399257654166
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn ’ t like her mother ’ s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.	21.721626666074886
Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways.	258.5230863869709
You could see there was a story behind it.	92.10563612196685
She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.	91.82019281879722
She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker ’ s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.	46.94092370245215
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks.	24.90734674439352
Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball.	23.353547244624153
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please.	39.23909490350238
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn ’ t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.	19.77316049439308
— If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.	120.19264424264422
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.	18.687651532515098
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.	42.550620193635076
Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.	33.935011212679534
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.	29.03420039616743
And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin ’ s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.	21.40753075680571
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.	20.52356114091517
Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.	13.273795693595641
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn ’ t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.	83.69713018496577
— Say papa, baby.	220.02978860578924
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.	27.15502879713677
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.	38.310478741637795
— Haja ja ja haja.	185.86154132496344
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him.	40.88544411213465
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.	27.393940788363274
It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.	87.6027408202726
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins.	57.97251274183833
She gazed out towards the distant sea.	93.18204853670305
And while she gazed her heart went pitapat.	39.982617179010845
Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look.	139.9272793872402
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul.	17.292510535452383
Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them?	37.75507544509858
People were so queer.	49.46870066697059
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn ’ t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting.	67.46596429704296
He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.	201.2034334682865
She would have given worlds to know what it was.	326.7776227947584
He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down.	69.53943424542145
She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away.	70.64443486895142
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.	79.47692743317586
It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no - one else.	222.5719845291975
If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not.	47.536176362371364
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her.	29.635959455964606
There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm.	17.497621366015213
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn ’ t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past.	48.280807660484925
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.	110.68601736106919
Refuge of sinners.	112.77067707425105
Comfortress of the afflicted.	1062.7314527641638
_Ora pro nobis_.	129.53949124709393
Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart.	32.52941879944145
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin ’ s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O ’ Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down.	91.88127353457028
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic.	32.46471360790698
He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature ’ s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word.	77.73435985678933
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours ’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.	33.85587086707673
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.	37.77330760137246
Little monkeys common as ditchwater.	32.07888220674746
Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them.	56.85969815211826
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.	33.620310354146675
— Jacky! Tommy! Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she ’ d ever bring them out.	33.914912878113675
She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn ’ t get it to grow long because it wasn ’ t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it.	82.2716566160268
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn ’ t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible.	69.49836747243378
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble.	15.395013159336546
_Tableau! _ That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness.	120.03912281434924
Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O ’ Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn ’ t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O ’ Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.	44.056041633286405
Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow ’ s of George ’ s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn ’ t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.	71.88027000131605
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature.	38.18220116307755
Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl ’ s shoulders — a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.	42.06662714700912
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.	60.35228801088733
She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve.	42.23772752726277
She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.	48.85438155909656
He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey.	96.18478323089663
Her woman ’ s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.	36.24030059833078
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.	22.954894162701372
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no - one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers.	36.479641383859814
And she said to Gerty: — A penny for your thoughts.	184.9202731458176
— What?	1096.145065448642
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.	63.30535810362885
I was only wondering was it late.	262.9037234647386
Because she wished to goodness they ’ d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late.	35.41564571822934
And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again.	48.10089624949833
But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.	120.01441971248128
— Wait, said Cissy, I ’ ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what ’ s the time by his conundrum.	116.49780335940417
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church.	110.00769244694271
Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself.	119.12872426862518
One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.	49.83405322878115
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set.	36.672426305682464
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.	70.35200063712777
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.	33.54515523800961
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O ’ Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.	69.66166289767817
It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets.	177.5668382139803
She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon.	40.520068114151094
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.	26.874015090424766
If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man ’ s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man ’ s face.	68.03123422394371
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.	381.0760719348472
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins ’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O ’ Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.	29.055626186763753
Gerty winced sharply.	77.15471359787055
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable.	28.72948808627017
It hurt — O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.	35.47285285686926
Gerty ’ s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.	17.444111073909262
She had loved him better than he knew.	171.2417617157173
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.	72.55395568715646
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.	30.35385196313565
— O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up.	77.11244756640438
I can throw my cap at who I like because it ’ s leap year.	95.50604965529581
Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.	36.73184746671332
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.	41.60667029221281
As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces.	31.320544882254264
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.	45.718624350275626
Miss puny little Edy ’ s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.	31.266199162077157
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior.	26.71033006325174
And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.	41.16712977786258
— O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss.	45.999051264421276
He has his bib destroyed.	104.15455195360599
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.	17.189099188173273
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O ’ Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.	27.512748922955048
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry.	44.52390641831078
And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.	14.127478589265374
For Gerty had her dreams that no - one knew of.	44.049070800735194
She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean.	39.42414419263201
It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely ’ s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs.	37.13948008414065
_Art thou real, my ideal? _ it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou ever? _ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.	22.908384251139157
But it must end, she felt.	469.12911442361315
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her.	73.30789010460757
Love laughs at locksmiths.	48.914069305499005
She would make the great sacrifice.	103.92830109383443
Her every effort would be to share his thoughts.	41.51865560179851
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness.	38.25430179731378
There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.	48.526932976044186
But even if — what then?	71.78100932026825
Would it make a very great difference?	44.64579638233147
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled.	37.19840286843913
No, no: not that.	174.82893588324714
They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.	48.859671838314775
Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.	118.69570489955306
She thought she understood.	338.5749749050888
She would try to understand him because men were so different.	36.60392963789052
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.	46.84068247412914
Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide.	101.36534033630406
Nothing else mattered.	69.32965279491717
Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.	29.678901591497112
Canon O ’ Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn ’ t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out: — O, look, Cissy! And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.	36.830559344286485
— It ’ s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.	144.52431631842063
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn ’ t fall running.	53.64450754963879
— Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.	86.31183028426248
It ’ s the bazaar fireworks.	132.86988129595028
But Gerty was adamant.	170.56895833438472
She had no intention of being at their beck and call.	30.40878402437174
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was.	24.629742513157698
The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling.	29.504902088905315
She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.	69.5162999586663
Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.	90.30493702488437
At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips.	46.33399866022746
His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her.	84.80721740077855
She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no - one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she ’ d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed.	62.37696322986774
But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips.	136.9959291117563
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn ’ t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors ’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.	37.64871351929202
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.	55.852281616735766
And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no - one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn ’ t ashamed and he wasn ’ t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn ’ t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.	48.1453539299154
She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl ’ s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages.	67.17213770998737
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft! Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.	21.766571320497274
Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.	30.335290126313005
He was leaning back against the rock behind.	89.61585362812541
Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.	36.083882213096544
What a brute he had been! At it again?	35.181495584516306
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?	101.23877315823975
An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered.	77.97162285430704
Should a girl tell?	91.51781608121583
No, a thousand times no.	493.8897073265985
That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don ’ t tell.	67.76151612350557
Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried: — Gerty! Gerty! We ’ re going.	70.53510389210159
Come on.	162.8815627186843
We can see from farther up.	153.1748931382461
Gerty had an idea, one of love ’ s little ruses.	45.3829271780206
She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back.	70.05206991349911
Wonder if he ’ s too far to.	115.6176696215426
She rose.	1197.507699355412
Was it goodbye?	57.54944152165164
No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve.	193.02649558251323
She drew herself up to her full height.	196.9727136298251
Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face.	35.582896293521685
She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.	43.75150946395727
Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman.	29.793764753865368
It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed.	49.754791173612766
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because — because Gerty MacDowell was...	25.270358449229665
Tight boots?	104.48244077495224
No. She ’ s lame! O! Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away.	73.7685448622824
Poor girl! That ’ s why she ’ s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint.	103.19182497942305
Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib.	55.43045518337816
Jilted beauty.	275.29382542023205
A defect is ten times worse in a woman.	49.71530731354484
But makes them polite.	249.75827764310597
Glad I didn ’ t know it when she was on show.	80.70454987857501
Hot little devil all the same.	136.94843595523062
I wouldn ’ t mind.	515.5604565366182
Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses.	59.076449860067235
That squinty one is delicate.	54.94948898604503
Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish.	38.98674538081983
I have such a bad headache today.	66.09960579118645
Where did I put the letter?	44.309116705163134
Yes, all right.	733.352027708849
All kinds of crazy longings.	40.714394536082615
Licking pennies.	275.29382542023205
Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil.	16.134345143988018
Virgins go mad in the end I suppose.	279.81724780013496
How many women in Dublin have it today?	115.86289763630032
Martha, she.	564.3836027983405
Something in the air.	234.77540298761804
That ’ s the moon.	156.62645289412816
But then why don ’ t all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean?	188.47036859740632
Depends on the time they were born I suppose.	701.4040867127837
Or all start scratch then get out of step.	65.1510720630253
Sometimes Molly and Milly together.	45.423539255952086
Anyhow I got the best of that.	110.16573419204124
Damned glad I didn ’ t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter.	84.20799735241066
Made up for that tramdriver this morning.	19.198601704698415
That gouger M ’ Coy stopping me to say nothing.	121.74188718347058
And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe.	277.8604588857718
Thankful for small mercies.	62.200804154614865
Yours for the asking.	591.011564834598
Because they want it themselves.	70.90161921281093
Their natural craving.	74.91264491200509
Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.	66.10492521566597
Reserve better.	275.29382542023205
Don ’ t want it they throw it at you.	123.11324490051412
Catch em alive, O.	37.19144266601956
Pity they can ’ t see themselves.	76.96546633653085
A dream of wellfilled hose.	112.72500748628107
Where was that?	52.27642356194148
Ah, yes.	184.5073741098551
Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only.	33.883603089737655
Peeping Tom.	174.3300534121752
Willy ’ s hat and what the girls did with it.	79.5075649307081
Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake?	32.48842548400462
_Lingerie_ does it.	113.90466163219905
Felt for the curves inside her <URL> Excites them also when they ’ re.	85.73435629279642
I ’ m all clean come and dirty me.	37.84782664026968
Milly delighted with Molly ’ s new blouse.	87.12688289625844
At first.	1717.5109835874391
Put them all on to take them all off.	169.8602502776899
Molly.	405.1642248429805
Why I bought her the violet garters.	99.25615448143637
Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers.	42.93868400513712
He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met.	89.9478588061334
His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what?	39.567770469036205
of jet.	16.127683096625855
Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out.	35.059122143238994
Pinned together.	205.98379323762953
O, Mairy lost the pin of her.	40.585215030755045
Dressed up to the nines for somebody.	108.86303308451065
Fashion part of their charm.	165.62836781909417
Just changes when you ’ re on the track of the secret.	301.8177492227645
Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then.	17.90095636965487
No reasonable offer refused.	179.0108624264506
She wasn ’ t in a hurry either.	308.45151997715857
Always off to a fellow when they are.	284.19225155292924
They never forget an appointment.	101.69121882873714
Out on spec probably.	54.435818148648416
They believe in chance because like themselves.	51.3093493987146
And the others inclined to give her an odd dig.	64.57167538101386
Girl friends at school, arms round each other ’ s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden.	24.9628862596917
Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can ’ t get.	44.976147753346986
Barbed wire.	275.29382542023205
Be sure now and write to me.	39.570557998814806
Now won ’ t you?	534.8795243516329
Molly and Josie Powell.	62.6722955129563
Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon.	39.583866197090174
_Tableau! _ O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all?	212.85146490632724
What have you been doing with yourself?	55.90002615997171
Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you.	51.99477995244659
Picking holes in each other ’ s appearance.	117.11387748539217
You ’ re looking splendid.	101.86204924298389
Sister souls.	18.33032426885951
Showing their teeth at one another.	31.188083912532473
How many have you left?	45.38390708159199
Wouldn ’ t lend each other a pinch of salt.	57.911501460320906
Ah! Devils they are when that ’ s coming on them.	62.00561582109873
Dark devilish appearance.	10.194501494954492
Scratch the sole of my foot.	51.52220328268245
O that way! O, that ’ s exquisite! Feel it myself too.	127.40368242141183
Good to rest once in a way.	37.04553122441542
Wonder if it ’ s bad to go with them then.	100.36561710847731
Safe in one way.	64.41371665585015
Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap.	43.258671281088986
Something about withering plants I read in a garden.	30.8249032998877
Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she ’ s a flirt.	74.58619337264167
Daresay she felt I.	91.70906976108792
When you feel like that you often meet what you feel.	90.10737927732987
Liked me or what?	81.66117135194155
Dress they look at.	163.2548469848851
Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs.	17.003956204456024
Well cocks and lions do the same and stags.	57.444826057475254
Same time might prefer a tie undone or something.	11.99009837834691
Trousers?	724.3403374961829
Suppose I when I was?	346.0226345733565
No. Gently does it.	79.23353454425086
Dislike rough and tumble.	52.319387647455216
Kiss in the dark and never tell.	160.848020399444
Saw something in me.	30.165168573045666
Wonder what.	169.6318537150332
Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic.	17.370691391716004
To aid gentleman in literary.	113.74975115750142
Ought to attend to my appearance my age.	64.15355354795747
Didn ’ t let her see me in profile.	79.7743836641894
Still, you never know.	116.87181542290851
Pretty girls and ugly men marrying.	26.529505912596036
Beauty and the beast.	48.01426873233523
Besides I can ’ t be so if Molly.	117.09648766627761
Wide brim.	275.29382542023205
Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell.	14.560415953139735
Hair strong in rut.	55.97720314254228
Ten bob I got for Molly ’ s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street.	85.96942558401501
Why not?	845.2860936402101
Suppose he gave her money.	1145.8156260222804
Why not?	845.2860936402101
All a prejudice.	79.93232240962494
She ’ s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound.	115.82806867732289
What?	1560.489681896445
I think so.	482.3040574172221
All that for nothing.	68.85819310245945
Bold hand: Mrs Marion.	39.463614095346394
Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn?	27.69880092151165
And the day I went to Drimmie ’ s without a necktie.	108.45559772096483
Wrangle with Molly it was put me off.	75.81099727534053
No, I remember.	2668.8443957766417
Richie Goulding: he ’ s another.	137.73555936389297
Weighs on his mind.	542.6534315334184
Funny my watch stopped at half past four.	17.60608887097359
Dust.	684.2060590120853
Shark liver oil they use to clean.	23.431005951857667
Could do it myself.	60.2472955836233
Save.	215.1483861869542
Was that just when he, she?	752.1714146321671
O, he did.	144.02117662953418
Into her.	199.6210976799746
She did.	1113.5137914785396
Done.	14.665309092669064
Ah! Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt.	73.5109685658064
O Lord, that little limping devil.	379.7504025633082
Begins to feel cold and clammy.	33.86274129088561
Aftereffect not pleasant.	112.77067707425105
Still you have to get rid of it someway.	226.20521177441282
They don ’ t care.	396.520931438863
Complimented perhaps.	275.52510858886325
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies.	18.749378177335068
Well, aren ’ t they?	102.71173163471155
See her as she is spoil all.	90.54775322017197
Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.	36.13599001708957
The name too.	53.17377261629667
_Amours_ of actresses.	112.77067707425105
Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe.	38.74779622975253
Curtain up.	297.3749512591072
Moonlight silver effulgence.	112.77067707425105
Maiden discovered with pensive bosom.	51.17729107297883
Little sweetheart come and kiss me.	34.08856104642978
Still, I feel.	832.3256564728993
The strength it gives a man.	95.02703065208595
That ’ s the secret of it.	183.08533074671416
Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam ’ s.	86.00683050024796
Cider that was.	446.58262236872935
Otherwise I couldn ’ t have.	112.5950610364697
Makes you want to sing after.	88.31227942231311
_Lacaus esant taratara_.	112.77067707425105
Suppose I spoke to her.	426.9607764747609
What about?	790.5677243407482
Bad plan however if you don ’ t know how to end the conversation.	57.04549806133462
Ask them a question they ask you another.	14.013316051077554
Good idea if you ’ re stuck.	286.05134607465993
Gain time.	275.3959248921919
But then you ’ re in a cart.	130.39042323420756
O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was.	53.82821655369961
Whew! Girl in Meath street that night.	22.821738199376316
All the dirty things I made her say.	100.69574676553663
All wrong of course.	235.06657124408818
My arks she called it.	35.94983559606574
It ’ s so hard to find one who.	74.27304330013989
Aho! If you don ’ t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden.	66.06107087942998
And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.	98.32460859636113
Parrots.	1218.4197832253003
O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That ’ s what they enjoy.	140.93346803465812
Taking a man from another woman.	19.323715139500056
Or even hear of it.	348.61071500847424
Different with me.	100.67128388889823
Glad to get away from other chap ’ s wife.	374.0133476289356
Eating off his cold plate.	58.754439842497014
Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle.	37.264290965379004
French letter still in my pocketbook.	66.34199634536645
But might happen sometime, I don ’ t think.	121.9595850586796
Come in, all is prepared.	89.38272384453074
I dreamt.	1007.3685738558459
What?	1560.489681896445
Worst is beginning.	82.54364171518819
How they change the venue when it ’ s not what they like.	120.84177407276465
Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who.	227.80016912729525
Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.	120.80954526913933
Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.	264.55122974251196
Because I did.	110.55854407319879
She too.	1623.4002807723655
Offend her.	294.8472913759627
Then make it up.	1030.897225867381
Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake.	87.55813736216739
Flatters them.	275.29382542023205
She must have been thinking of someone else all the time.	177.8105596056404
What harm?	938.5324891868371
Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he.	301.12743535572685
First kiss does the trick.	32.46160532761388
The propitious moment.	431.86779752570317
Something inside them goes pop.	30.83037323712306
First thoughts are best.	45.470002615837984
Remember that till their dying day.	21.841606877179636
Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens.	13.715492334941079
But her breasts were developed.	98.19620719156254
Fell asleep then.	101.55103292581168
After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home.	80.15248828928894
Featherbed mountain.	275.29382542023205
Gnashing her teeth in sleep.	50.50868879984063
Val Dillon.	241.49417917221882
Apoplectic.	1218.4197832253003
There she is with them down there for the fireworks.	276.21035583815194
My fireworks.	183.0162153306878
Up like a rocket, down like a stick.	231.1907274256677
And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen.	41.493866425155616
Want to be grownups.	95.57292200269316
Dressing in mother ’ s clothes.	168.07926518361634
Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.	182.25718736221802
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth.	233.18815627908202
I knew she could whistle.	348.36453762599336
Mouth made for that.	12.422918643092684
Like Molly.	290.4190102864384
Would you mind, please, telling me the right time?	48.612570029897896
I ’ ll tell you the right time up a dark lane.	148.63627655850442
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips.	27.577593262004786
Caressing the little boy too.	75.24524839295738
Onlookers see most of the game.	225.47355345003137
Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.	17.776096649579745
In their line.	363.0081923093229
Didn ’ t look back when she was going down the strand.	156.85078299965713
Wouldn ’ t give that satisfaction.	81.06872657448334
Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.	13.371603665300723
Fine eyes she had, clear.	61.83557057551925
It ’ s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil.	58.17814343790241
Did she know what I?	298.8680394277301
Course.	478.4855867839747
Like a cat sitting beyond a dog ’ s jump.	58.46389216034178
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show.	31.43271501081138
Call that innocence?	64.36345354047725
Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.	43.86661826728276
Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_.	25.3405084760029
Eyes all over them.	121.05431717669514
Look under the bed for what ’ s not there.	151.72821398422244
Longing to get the fright of their lives.	99.16752681129942
Sharp as needles they are.	41.439973677177456
When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm.	120.7717229424457
Had, too.	105.82431148872638
Where do they get that?	233.02646585666346
Typist going up Roger Greene ’ s stairs two at a time to show her understandings.	40.87271972636605
Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.	55.16553459919788
Bred in the bone.	552.0191436570142
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing.	46.88415304910715
Best place for an ad to catch a woman ’ s eye on a mirror.	97.6818213717668
And when I sent her for Molly ’ s Paisley shawl to Prescott ’ s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx.	48.20537894159617
I never told her.	400.1061511202315
Attract men, small thing like that.	87.39550541652753
Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red.	72.45521287816089
Who did you learn that from?	184.27154199299852
Nobody.	16.740590691709745
Something the nurse taught me.	37.687080036385474
O, don ’ t they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly ’ s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west.	42.67449167447581
Me have a nice pace.	346.6355179538934
Mullingar.	502.22953946992163
Who knows?	876.3154158740043
Ways of the world.	1400.8215858722633
Young student.	82.37378319234055
Straight on her pins anyway not like the other.	65.48178561073054
Still she was game.	182.77306186592367
Lord, I am wet.	245.60244635867613
Devil you are.	51.45496827698246
Swell of her calf.	136.23492675373126
Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.	31.39931168051725
Not like that frump today.	210.8480127353294
A.	14508.205342004916
E.	189.06299250251155
Rumpled stockings.	203.07158957055697
Or the one in Grafton street.	96.23104041043769
White.	362.578692018612
Wow! Beef to the heel.	126.0633150001839
Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads.	26.916871003851607
And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks.	82.15915197086775
Will she?	140.94568938066297
Watch! Watch! See! Looked round.	16.65592562365097
She smelt an onion.	203.02464673260428
Darling, I saw, your.	274.8737506916478
I saw all.	2704.5028279958424
Lord! Did me good all the same.	81.85182062908342
Off colour after Kiernan ’ s, Dignam ’ s.	94.91344474084359
For this relief much thanks.	31.028549506054336
In _Hamlet, _ that is.	290.72210934591504
Lord! It was all things combined.	149.29783619085254
Excitement.	1218.4197832253003
When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue.	73.52053347091122
Your head it simply swirls.	25.00959827899679
He ’ s right.	476.6418321712256
Might have made a worse fool of myself however.	23.043739064728396
Instead of talking about nothing.	123.871001941747
Then I will tell you all.	69.6126708881365
Still it was a kind of language between us.	65.73986527944675
It couldn ’ t be?	286.50881697224133
No, Gerty they called her.	408.4968011883711
Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin ’ s barn a blind.	55.10904333667271
Her maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.	22.57188661225302
Place made me think of that I suppose.	409.0579524938754
All tarred with the same brush.	270.58044388547074
Wiping pens in their stockings.	81.45102208045324
But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood.	272.08719590318407
Every bullet has its billet.	29.720585321881025
Course I never could throw anything straight at school.	18.9127601777087
Crooked as a ram ’ s horn.	562.7317638441158
Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa ’ s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller ’ s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah.	51.84417897728909
No soft job.	460.57700313131676
Saves them.	275.29382542023205
Nature.	22.186048183429246
Washing child, washing corpse.	57.520911305076936
Dignam.	240.86349921391303
Children ’ s hands always round them.	102.13750789772884
Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.	22.86321448016907
Oughtn ’ t to have given that child an empty teat to suck.	50.40246134216477
Fill it up with wind.	1481.9311603487683
Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy.	99.59208225034526
Must call to the hospital.	226.25537137528806
Wonder is nurse Callan there still.	21.71997584118491
She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace.	205.21414871070118
That young doctor O ’ Hare I noticed her brushing his coat.	33.30675008228462
And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable.	111.98624023105542
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms.	140.17948633762103
Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.	26.320703851370062
Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.	114.22499054930638
Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night?	224.77335097112012
Chickens come home to roost.	83.67731297829512
They stick by one another like glue.	282.29714173019704
Maybe the women ’ s fault also.	122.11862268695448
That ’ s where Molly can knock spots off them.	33.44613510122475
It ’ s the blood of the south.	193.9475172714989
Moorish.	1023.1607478356453
Also the form, the figure.	316.9732587074411
Hands felt for the opulent.	157.27668399162448
Just compare for instance those others.	57.08341578424167
Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard.	101.13547751005282
Allow me to introduce my.	120.4735999201283
Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn ’ t know what to call her.	33.17238401269716
Always see a fellow ’ s weak point in his wife.	122.59110233604756
Still there ’ s destiny in it, falling in love.	264.5921575320322
Have their own secrets between them.	45.5578825489011
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn ’ t take them in hand.	74.87867452835128
Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies.	46.70145522714365
As God made them he matched them.	34.37161469691958
Twice nought makes one.	50.78059647831953
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride.	35.24553546333666
Marry in May and repent in December.	20.155653524631006
This wet is very unpleasant.	52.11448423908739
Stuck.	724.3403374961829
Well the foreskin is not back.	113.71573295036495
Better detach.	177.8359182763846
Ow! Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket.	32.43687758719919
Long and the short of it.	575.3683501806212
Very strange about my watch.	41.150642858473674
Wristwatches are always going wrong.	54.73149252798042
Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he.	148.78243593551946
Yes, I suppose, at once.	636.650955208606
Cat ’ s away, the mice will play.	323.4518402971208
I remember looking in Pill lane.	89.96568272414211
Also that now is magnetism.	69.26972715083672
Back of everything magnetism.	55.97720314254228
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.	35.10347251887872
That causes movement.	108.45038506763302
And time, well that ’ s the time the movement takes.	237.16729130040403
Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.	31.923816433705884
Because it ’ s all arranged.	218.1266558837692
Magnetic needle tells you what ’ s going on in the sun, the stars.	97.0740904198631
Little piece of steel iron.	55.37123886184475
When you hold out the fork.	102.59479107755476
Come.	232.90336313975413
Come.	232.90336313975413
Woman and man that is.	149.98222856778162
Fork and steel.	112.77067707425105
Molly, he.	1020.6206562551588
Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you ’ re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you.	83.51966587245484
Tip.	644.5508818121558
Have to let fly.	69.17412272149222
Wonder how is she feeling in that region.	49.344944266417706
Shame all put on before third person.	95.24975144442261
More put out about a hole in her stocking.	49.83987797389525
Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show.	75.05568776694709
And when the painters were in Lombard street west.	73.72489297326067
Fine voice that fellow had.	47.09834187336401
How Giuglini began.	127.50340022231033
Smell that I did.	141.6563991374603
Like flowers.	293.5812030458463
It was too.	581.057678728532
Violets.	1218.4197832253003
Came from the turpentine probably in the paint.	164.10662470541507
Make their own use of everything.	187.92262370428048
Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn ’ t hear.	32.49735111208593
But lots of them can ’ t kick the beam, I think.	161.33714107012867
Keep that thing up for hours.	53.540246678559875
Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.	43.42204780525343
Wait.	199.9002065950114
Hm. Hm. Yes.	32.23246744440748
That ’ s her perfume.	187.59800308855887
Why she waved her hand.	144.73956998320645
I leave you this to think of me when I ’ m far away on the pillow.	87.42080651718108
What is it?	679.4579743358286
Heliotrope?	1218.4197832253003
No. Hyacinth?	284.0594937646069
Hm. Roses, I think.	70.53054840354538
She ’ d like scent of that kind.	831.9039904848737
Sweet and cheap: soon sour.	20.895816223476352
Why Molly likes opoponax.	220.9271068353435
Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed.	58.52397834054366
Her high notes and her low notes.	28.090831256284034
At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours.	175.67243744790747
Heat brought it out.	248.12429979483875
She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before.	245.06001130847537
Good conductor, is it?	44.09194758408176
Or bad?	1682.2090420384898
Light too.	116.09826509251334
Suppose there ’ s some connection.	624.5585144998454
Mysterious thing too.	88.40530891686868
Why did I smell it only now?	198.82261306963775
Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure.	17.174497917544183
Suppose it ’ s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across.	75.05505972857387
Yes, it is.	450.18113120360033
Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off.	34.47754268927429
Tell you what it is.	567.753342956387
It ’ s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they ’ re always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it.	33.02408589515335
Clings to everything she takes off.	45.63646429804963
Warm shoe.	186.38277244620522
Stays.	1218.4197832253003
Drawers: little kick, taking them off.	34.48556316381146
Byby till next time.	62.216244937773425
Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed.	35.217192150597185
Know her smell in a thousand.	46.3441181843235
Bathwater too.	275.29382542023205
Reminds me of strawberries and cream.	40.02635815029702
There or the armpits or under the neck.	53.31429016910496
Because you get it out of all holes and corners.	177.74844832757134
Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.	17.13527139095973
Muskrat.	1218.4197832253003
Bag under their tails.	78.83501183400547
One grain pour off odour for years.	25.272844706751705
Dogs at each other behind.	64.39432087017582
Good evening.	190.6205534011156
Evening.	684.2060590120853
How do you sniff?	268.6010540117699
Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you.	23.936739088378093
Yes now, look at it that way.	307.56238381096625
We ’ re the same.	359.3292409682451
Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period.	43.93812544353793
Come near.	317.3758095080405
Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.	56.138761405251785

Belfry up there.	150.4286826766897
Very likely.	133.7354629037981
Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity.	126.7202215321296

Better sit still.	79.50136710174193
All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles.	33.18137521808807
Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands.	60.644198787128175
Weeny bones.	275.53151501354023

Birds too.	178.5825216515837
Never find out.	3298.517854331397
Or what they say.	5652.758604372032
Like our small talk.	64.45872531985535
Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back.	88.1675601854882

Big brutes of oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows.	23.07422018187041
_Faugh a ballagh! _ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow.	20.82745569350116
Married too.	217.21349569404808
Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere.	126.21968522144425
No ends really because it ’ s round.	233.2741630010303
Wife in every port they say.	64.58084384780977

And the tephilim no what ’ s this they call it poor papa ’ s father had on his door to touch.	67.18010113897635
That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage.	143.67607454413894
Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers.	59.476110247202286
Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that ’ s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him.	67.27762926185898
Do fish ever get seasick?	43.37608539918893
Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones ’ locker, moon looking down so peaceful.	17.61986898762747
Not my fault, old cockalorum.	88.65318668180127
A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds for Mercer ’ s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars.	22.926708887736247
They floated, fell: they faded.	76.17392639576886
The shepherd ’ s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst.	86.96843233675459
From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o ’ clock postman, the glowworm ’ s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges.	36.930720424560384
And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy ’ s terrace.	39.11858589464508
By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races! _ and from the door of Dignam ’ s house a boy ran out and called.	25.13763046190604
Twittering the bat flew here, flew there.	29.655761610787
Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey.	43.433737003426046
Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns.	31.68525545348168
He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake.	15.39598053185206
And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.	30.312642537730696

Milly, no sign of funk.	199.30996483238323
Her blue scarf loose, laughing.	31.039122456603522
Don ’ t know what death is at that age.	102.03865586461784

But being lost they fear.	91.11423946890085
When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin.	52.5917901909441
I didn ’ t want to.	187.83646260888258
Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood.	86.75485032361941
Frightening them with masks too.	55.660204126973376
Throwing them up in the air to catch them.	110.79600396891465

Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot.	36.62422417334787
Write a message for her.	116.52491625440088
Might remain.	270.6452313162061

All these rocks with lines and scars and letters.	19.154725658062375
O, those transparent! Besides they don ’ t know.	86.71317433491423

Far in the grey a bell chimed.	392.6264320819165
Mr Bloom with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed.	99.41161095824265
The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest ’ s house cooed where Canon O ’ Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.	126.97289629907529

Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the rocks looking was Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	60.82205828928933

Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Universally that person ’ s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind ’ s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature ’ s incorrupted benefaction.	13.034705782614047
For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature ’ s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution ’ s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?	13.731748508210318
It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.	49.682293996955075
Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O ’ Shiels, the O ’ Hickeys, the O ’ Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux.	33.841080584182464
Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.	13.446283092222247
To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile.	12.630200455767815

Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.	16.62075543913013
As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared.	17.328303089551234
Glad after she was that ere adread was.	48.781801423281095
Her he asked if O ’ Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O ’ Hare Doctor in heaven was.	28.425366060955437
Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful.	22.743776951130428
All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God ’ s rightwiseness to withsay.	28.63933727414617
She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men ’ s oil to his limbs.	42.25154511390112
The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness.	37.2872578343641
He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring.	39.13351053787258
So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.	29.223521514861503
Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother ’ s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.	52.55454710581125
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.	162.19366293155673
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be.	52.89168334201002
She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman ’ s birth.	38.330807807593665
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house.	60.368143698180496
The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women ’ s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid.	54.48572044815951
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.	6.582667101871799
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat.	37.88518881680328
And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon.	41.28154688909879
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.	26.342404131478357
And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there.	74.74245943334041
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile.	42.73065197254775
Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.	39.469900092952514
But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle.	27.27765826088025
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.	24.220524615243445
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment.	45.82084297050535
And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously.	22.502117170804045
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles.	56.98017393374591
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer.	24.391999846379345
And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.	26.882786507119175
And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.	52.36726116198383
And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain.	31.26205598459606
And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.	52.95246008176232
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.	11.0634690403805
And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile.	22.350943479128556
And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile.	58.95253907061083
Thanked be Almighty God.	62.200804154614865
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.	23.52143824746748
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now.	40.50291790399077
Meseems it dureth overlong.	62.200804154614865
And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently.	65.01704866727395
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.	18.32816033590433
And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next.	131.28591267220335
Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both ’ s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness.	69.55310282993152
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars ’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup.	37.734263772788516
Woman ’ s woe with wonder pondering.	85.56458283855173
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might.	191.9255398818716
There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable ’ s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold.	40.779357696300174
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.	38.02299140877668
Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.	40.853397504122405
For they were right witty scholars.	52.72828694407025
And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne ’ s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case).	16.49876627738123
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die.	35.61500463107152
And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy.	29.197911032611525
A redress God grant.	151.60002295913935
This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die.	32.38014167567982
In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack.	20.074604170679752
Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved.	25.654901760547073
To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.	18.314106480528203
Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.	39.48089458601166
But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life?	25.415857985132682
For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.	170.15510151676924
We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.	26.10095825659993
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.	25.50899971369318
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.	48.89405976752591
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi ’ s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do.	27.258906216290633
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever.	32.33379340961861
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides.	19.30186037996246
He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God ’ s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman ’ s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded.	14.48069135563717
All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life.	12.51096053394663
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions.	31.813261568368233
That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word.	49.44204103296234
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.	75.03777804464171
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny.	26.865984053845196
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb ’ s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend ’ s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.	42.87606261615937
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.	26.656534138834978
Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul ’ s bodiment.	37.03036322756978
Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone.	23.965319679641798
Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay.	28.16478921270423
See ye here.	590.3390207182251
And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ.	112.82003294449362
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore.	33.301289763521254
His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time ’ s ruins build eternity ’ s mansions.	118.65248652732576
What means this?	410.9897803161762
Desire ’ s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time.	24.487700747217772
Mark me now.	12.43512190021327
In woman ’ s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.	47.713917623479766
This is the postcreation.	57.627330012264764
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	30.953332073288284
No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.	21.8569258979696
But here is the matter now.	180.60655156304676
Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, _parceque M.	46.995216740558675
Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l ’ avait mise dans cette fichue position c ’ était le sacré pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_ transubstantiality _oder_ consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality.	6.799321117907161
And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word.	65.85146920775107
A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.	47.91415013975246
Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship.	46.15187332170822
With will will we withstand, withsay.	65.56962783620571
Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo, _ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard.	15.586370451915725
It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time ’ s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred.	22.489378621999528
In Horne ’ s house rest should reign.	198.25303500594248
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar ’ s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.	30.46457460139354
Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.	20.74284658755142
But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin.	50.720135464796456
Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided.	20.563129960312793
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their _Maid ’ s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals.	43.55800436042777
An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.	23.22016006078562
Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come.	22.289258382619664
Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it.	36.933175607655265
Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.	182.98324028446385
Go thou and do likewise.	47.48716514139163
Thus, or words to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden.	12.171116703838662

Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum.	15.80839582179838
Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants.	28.846326049187645
Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian.	24.84294334025837
Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money.	20.54609831807246
But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever.	19.105374787983084
And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth.	65.67587131173123
This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell ’ s gates visited a darkness that was foraneous.	101.25841951679894

And as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being.	18.60824876977766
The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend.	8.980915259316625
First, saved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage.	25.507158740843522
And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.	14.785876764077893
Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.	19.801932943351872
Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack See the malt stored in many a refluent sack, In the proud cirque of Jackjohn ’ s bivouac.	15.843458112477075
A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back.	78.94503875852041
Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler.	16.48039310901832
Came now the storm that hist his heart.	22.347304023624275
And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry.	23.792566379790447
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm.	31.594847369328285
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour.	27.034741557359542
But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.	75.25743632982979
But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne ’ s hall.	33.54325979407293
He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart ’ s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.	54.825345381914865
But was young Boasthard ’ s fear vanquished by Calmer ’ s words?	135.01720502200538
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other?	54.2597531727429
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either.	90.82306866796111
But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal?	47.63210139092927
Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle.	53.61391658736527
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon?	42.51736587588457
Heard?	684.2060590120853
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done).	119.0003391955846
For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.	130.18920527602305
And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away?	45.416168825011894
By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law.	23.695215477119238
Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe - on - Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it?	39.58506046234349
Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird - in - the - Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two - in - the - Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.	44.18355232265239
For regarding Believe - on - Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two - in - the - Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild.	22.696845936007872
So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer.	55.499078509536375
Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.	23.598986774336353
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.	111.99171375267234
Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won ’ t sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.	15.131461458862905
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without.	28.51466259202228
The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire.	18.225597173926356
All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.	42.442156744979236
But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came.	48.57267210437427
In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke ’ s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first.	24.49204061407866
Over against the Rt. Hon.	30.999775962742977

Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M ’ s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne ’ s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne ’ s.	49.48591201865036
There Leop.	293.39652894804436

Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can ’ t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue.	58.87801612508397
’ Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick ’ s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king ’ s bible.	63.8713560073468
Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear.	26.678434810688643
In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi ’ s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer ’ s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.	25.968052953027687
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night ’ s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen ’ s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk.	89.98363245311123
He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat.	28.7991682131279
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook ’ s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother ’ s son of them would burst their sides.	45.86216672709749
The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale.	91.89398773425916
Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’ tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague.	126.7487900572175
But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.	75.54979277727737
There ’ s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.	41.58938199651478
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too.	89.37372345263033
One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire ’ s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids ’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge.	38.380543426954176
He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him.	39.03686419743828
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?	187.52109242710128
I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he.	74.98367976434724
I can scarce believe ’ tis so bad, says he.	61.89025603583976
And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low ’ s yard in Prussia street.	16.970049463621105
I question with you there, says he.	149.04196008890312
More like ’ tis the hoose or the timber tongue.	18.3487102960942
Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor ’ s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns.	54.67975177306359
Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.	22.288505872402848
Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop.	31.780139616710215
I conceive you, says Mr Dixon.	778.9819899338698
It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose.	72.26011963914789
True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock.	59.39089051079256
He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.	35.00852873553218
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself.	35.50857647934211
So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer ’ s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly.	72.7480475563194
But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.	44.950398843622985
Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart ’ s content.	49.00686156604008
By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.	48.25253190965528
To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls ’ language and they all after him.	26.84973492393146
Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground.	71.51887659741699
And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he ’ d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry ’ s orders.	27.916865606861023
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I ’ ll meddle in his matters, says he.	72.73416903190422
I ’ ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me.	38.438242891712235
But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show.	46.687732158169354
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow ’ s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name.	64.6304408540351
Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls ’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.	49.21439743662933
In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.	90.69671956548252
They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America.	21.873457137416857
Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: _ — Pope Peter ’ s but a pissabed.	56.99986961530102
A man ’ s a man for a ’ <URL> Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars.	43.77017111069706
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell ’ s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.	25.16412156368198
Fertiliser and Incubator.	112.77067707425105
Lambay Island_.	275.29382542023205
His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed.	24.23725689412059
Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon.	213.94137265847658
I make no doubt it smacks of wenching.	52.88535673418859
Come, be seated, both.	48.69762415971189
’ Tis as cheap sitting as standing.	18.75543762147811
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired.	32.04893992261033
It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep.	24.781942893592813
To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party.	18.43792296233434
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural.	22.725479502662605
Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains.	62.7961171512606
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.	15.148715885348155
For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies.	12.88665874726996
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it.	29.904906935523655
They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan ’ s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.	36.82650735243429
His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary ’ s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.	31.64958115430061
Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.	16.486408031841872
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced.	23.04071810077078
The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour.	71.51076468532783
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give?	46.25285254285302
Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne ’ s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman ’ s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.	50.434358774007514
Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.	50.79703201821344
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’ tis pity she ’ s a trollop): There ’ s a belly that never bore a bastard.	15.329808765976868
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.	20.86236192561185
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.	92.06276521383447
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.	26.56887443441728
That you may and very opportunely.	41.4096582169904
There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity.	19.16214814183562
But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things.	60.97896589316179
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.	35.445132765528
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’ pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.	21.91911828646307
I declare, I was never so touched in all my life.	112.3247385415185
God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours.	20.18413214944454
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.	41.94261759701923
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years.	31.767683167287057
But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.	600.2160785374166
How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.	25.40964438910694
Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish.	56.2565511769499
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it.	32.871951159950655
Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.	60.18471576933938
But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.	44.11275778115795
Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak.	23.794143244794746
A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.	91.20558446434293
Pooh! A _livre! _ cries Monsieur Lynch.	85.1830368103033
The clumsy things are dear at a sou.	61.042774159692065
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.	18.00881254903458
No woman of any wit would wear one.	59.0915884317207
The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath...	32.45590097508201
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.	23.031174018626295
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company.	23.462229502316113
The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry.	22.365292705275216
Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.	40.289873319006205
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I ’ ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you.	42.07950154631304
What, you dog?	283.13159193149096
Have you a way with them?	91.84751510730304
Gad ’ s bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch.	178.2871860710662
Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I ’ m all of a wibbly wobbly.	54.874300181358926
Why, you ’ re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.	59.29415728926724
I knows a lady what ’ s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.	102.45995956038703
The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.	67.98343422604408
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.	66.05759410002472
I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.	19.095725648630708
I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast.	37.36919696827289
I cannot away with them.	157.10544323341753
What?	1560.489681896445
Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours?	79.74350195962431
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay?	32.25076418106761
Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.	20.68917621385271
Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door.	31.961647284202417
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath.	20.504150156653015
Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.	21.17735436941608
To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.	35.2418185064991
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.	14.087182628198386
But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon ’ s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation ’ s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.	70.54031430234333
It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable.	25.04091022405969
To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat.	15.703990181223388
Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.	31.402767524221826
To conclude, while from the sister ’ s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.	55.53743201917571
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.	32.29053900574144
The dressy young blade said it was her husband ’ s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron.	32.10522225552704
I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her.	37.765314974990986
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.	69.12162948180786
’ Slife, I ’ ll be round with you.	124.56237594271487
I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her.	17.746690960748023
All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household.	29.45736696570799
Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest.	26.039853237824428
But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.	34.32587935701975
But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity?	21.34974670209199
Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled?	99.13835391162144
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents?	20.34852087510188
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?	19.076057869894562
Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?	52.185776835679015
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.	23.761187293307078
Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate.	32.046043121406946
He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy ’ s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe ’ s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic.	34.882717447092475
It ill becomes him to preach that gospel.	77.98168552653631
Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare?	48.84221837306718
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life.	19.289526712384887
If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him.	7.164141486350461
His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.	22.39924890128324
The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.	20.150516222624034
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born.	54.879261933352666
When he had betaken himself to the women ’ s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues.	34.004202499223204
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain.	32.134809546582375
The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent.	40.08897053828253
Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king ’ s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt, _ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents — in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations.	29.646280643733924
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.	24.71519333750794
The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human.	44.96475105708265
An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.	46.52908965622955
The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived.	45.83384065889801
It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.	16.556291531249887
Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.	12.796861875549991
Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.	27.519115055478924
But Malachias ’ tale began to freeze them with horror.	42.16606032338004
He conjured up the scene before them.	341.2710375536317
The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared...	99.50728101035418
Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked <URL> Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.	20.266625415963613
I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame.	33.16430621456218
Yes, it is true.	380.912185082377
I am the murderer of Samuel Childs.	40.177972619704704
And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me.	38.14463699447587
This is the appearance is on me.	129.22794485936214
Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?	24.415001746820618
My hell, and Ireland ’ s, is in this life.	215.26240825860083
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.	171.95741202144026
Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out.	36.27807150900944
In vain! His spectre stalks me.	55.041674195456814
Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.	29.84338445216319
He was gone.	446.7851196278351
Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host.	139.72730969062928
The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_.	28.044310381771037
The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.	43.80716866779011
Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.	25.650243069574284
The mystery was unveiled.	190.338094691918
Haines was the third brother.	129.777645691673
His real name was Childs.	141.29402660762383
The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.	64.63386774918288
He drank drugs to obliterate.	71.29062873088273
For this relief much thanks.	31.028549506054336
The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.	155.0184777005508
No soul will live there.	117.88615291273607
The spider pitches her web in the solitude.	183.83788912187643
The nocturnal rat peers from his hole.	95.3650946710105
A curse is on it.	675.3505874759342
It is haunted.	515.4289397367023
Murderer ’ s ground.	452.7437306297469
What is the age of the soul of man?	420.1227418767164
As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood.	20.551477174585244
No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds.	35.33243102373112
A score of years are blown away.	68.29296422358343
He is young Leopold.	190.0215349954202
There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.	40.70677266135877
That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother ’ s thought.	48.517246332168234
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart?	55.54236517193751
But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist.	80.71593249188015
Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons.	52.02389674836423
Who can say?	667.0283677791954
The wise father knows his own child.	82.61532423166076
He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first.	158.02344227446164
Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.	36.72467483998211
Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight.	73.37941773785364
They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat! _) light shall flood the world.	52.91631189085098
Did heart leap to heart?	46.13628367684577
Nay, fair reader.	10.73860470391237
In a breath ’ twas done but — hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk.	17.669275743548113
She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.	69.69904038211172
She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day.	42.92276288944044
No, Leopold.	1454.5354055409837
Name and memory solace thee not.	27.884302388972863
That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee — and in vain.	26.313116185732156
No son of thy loins is by thee.	68.59174129337224
There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.	59.56544062605682
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived.	13.018966970991158
A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.	8.697084987081926
She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal.	35.731925997760456
Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.	18.7409747093493
They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.	47.892900690720026
Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.	56.712548334471734
Netaim, the golden, is no more.	500.01711506798745
And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts.	127.48573281990552
Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions.	16.44304700485813
Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_.	32.16494458522264
Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.	22.29480906703582
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.	40.46619686064252
And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven ’ s own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo.	48.748140631999526
And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin.	96.50336541297077
It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.	339.27056448757185
How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer.	21.213304014212838
It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.	12.67206914955835
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee ’ s time.	43.7841362872369
He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus.	33.768639762127385
Where were they now?	271.2175533641243
Neither knew.	186.38277244620522
You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said.	70.26387872971652
Why think of them?	946.4566620707817
If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call?	35.266567597223464
Who supposes it?	467.18041255381144
I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life.	12.506390818798703
He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.	27.287103394250515
That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father.	25.207764943055324
All who wish you well hope this for you.	20.36048940117033
All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos.	32.67006120221259
I heartily wish you may not fail them.	51.385615693887075
O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him.	312.6857967935318
Have no fear.	124.90065569114492
He could not leave his mother an orphan.	73.059304026677
The young man ’ s face grew dark.	134.6412091888091
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss.	73.1588835923387
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart.	43.370549546230606
Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider ’ s name: Lenehan as much more.	44.72287686659641
He told them of the race.	296.0255643798824
Madden up.	11.933965030498914
She was leading the field.	91.52487330404483
All hearts were beating.	76.29656803352626
Even Phyllis could not contain herself.	35.02136516828878
She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her.	28.249104411695384
All was lost now.	76.29658338791604
Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones.	34.33815943854226
Juno, she cried, I am undone.	1261.2410761425826
A tear fell: one only.	82.4865975241785
A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W.	68.8378720552401
Lane.	812.0832237234374
Four winners yesterday and three today.	25.604151805885927
What rider is like him?	181.07150372196753
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.	28.499525701032354
But let us bear it as was the ancient wont.	89.82627223298957
Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh.	37.82945449327872
She is not the filly that she was.	55.81452332547094
Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another.	62.895672897527085
By gad, sir, a queen of them.	117.00154155626645
Do you remember her, Vincent?	51.5504263127411
I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said.	47.83060004420803
How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it.	28.070867804023834
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.	37.175969359070464
In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge.	18.29622872416455
A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.	34.88915272067781
Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together.	21.223211583288585
And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field.	54.31424648147872
Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.	46.78749356849276
The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her.	26.47138844419385
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries.	27.030303022367917
But he had been kind.	367.4643652094389
In going by he had blessed us.	245.05557489376622
The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.	75.59999903464353
If I had poor luck with Bass ’ s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely.	35.281723995086864
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.	38.820979017705646
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.	20.642381163335518
His soul is far away.	173.09469811720345
It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born.	96.8381391447446
Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.	43.308389786126455
Do you not think it, Stephen?	504.6180819528318
Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.	48.06618671129983
The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.	43.19731618367758
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all.	29.770401680435878
The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop.	15.436860504427196
During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton - on - Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone ’ s remark on account of its scarlet appearance.	19.75908818581709
He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before ’ s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.	25.276509581409407
Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.	46.18126278837135
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life.	128.38085864689188
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.	19.869959681535928
The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital.	185.21045945198586
The high hall of Horne ’ s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic.	39.40356237051165
A gallant scene in truth it made.	48.748368449820944
Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.	95.42027259870869
There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom.	28.43302828852007
Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden.	21.85604125021913
The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer ’ s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.	19.075139783214045
Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.	17.89324456821473
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S.	52.34163103815304
Dedalus ’ (Div.	56.474447209306376
Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods.	15.268673305327052
The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can.	32.38564212579345
There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer — at present — such as the first problem submitted by Mr L.	27.25454266959515
Bloom (Pubb.	363.1748776188067
Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.	62.71995000297533
Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both?	14.85009704150831
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature ’ s favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_, of the passive element.	83.2780189603594
The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.	48.80976584528902
It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways.	46.701243722500756
Mr M.	302.9387220442264
Mulligan (Hyg.	51.95096976857479
et Eug.	275.29382542023205
Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.	18.89609411427851
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust.	15.915218836251055
These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas — these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.	32.31723741192327
Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.	17.418907628222296
Mr J.	316.23357360431237
Crotthers (Disc.	88.40530891686868
Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide.	26.755402983479357
Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative.	18.07790495864192
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions.	33.8280884514775
An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V.	159.50823485360044
Lynch (Bacc.	80.90752102628478
Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature ’ s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.	22.810470117268633
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet ’ s words, give us pause.	18.1860941595735
Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.	16.781599468208885
Mr S.	302.77454743195904
Dedalus ’ (Div.	56.474447209306376
Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.	9.481712503429975
For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother.	12.082135033395222
In a recent public controversy with Mr L.	39.158736100160354
Bloom (Pubb.	363.1748776188067
Canv.) which took place in the commons ’ hall of the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A.	104.63092995367818

At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.	41.18342668988246
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy <URL> It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor.	16.165283520252903
All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped.	21.304089047266803
She had.	968.5428357905195
She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy.	33.22149705857691
Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene.	46.70834195304938
Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband.	50.633447148749724
And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God ’ s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces.	32.51650829546107
He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch.	54.503333809571174
O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days.	59.58190186824666
God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose.	17.604280071092347
Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer ’ s office, Dublin Castle.	49.43656082283988
And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here.	20.143500240960563
No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina.	211.42413576299296
And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.	48.98261910577211
He knows and will call in His own good time.	32.228206647024756
You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man ’ s part.	41.070452033412664
Sir, to you my hand.	330.71422247818737
Well done, thou good and faithful servant! There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait.	29.69617537756116
He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.	29.892603135728375
Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.	30.508677445567287
Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.	22.269216155398702
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair, _ for the cruder things of life.	38.5098891063916
A scene disengages itself in the observer ’ s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.	37.714675755738035
A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock.	24.10720385993693
And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.	19.884366471905032
A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.	18.15354427919865
He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad look.	20.184974190352147

Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent.	53.80001005440528
Quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago.	18.647031172716915
But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word.	11.545838848872345

BLOOM: _ (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing, yaps.) _ Truffles! _ (With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet: then lies, shamming dead, with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.) _ BELLO: _ (With bobbed hair, purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer ’ s puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moorcock ’ s feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) _ Footstool!

Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in D ’ Olier street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox.	20.720069865523158
By word and deed he frankly encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises.	8.74311792282167
In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males.	16.696608684919838
And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see?	29.157705135141136
Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?	22.198525993207223

Safe home! THE HORSE: _ (Neighs.) _ Hohohohohome.	228.4269532299522
BLOOM: Good night.	189.38648848257836
I ’ ll just wait and take him along in a few...	83.01635675608675
_ (Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it.	79.14141146491019
The horse harness jingles.) _ CORNY KELLEHER: _ (From the car, standing.) _ Night.	121.61963393235666

_ (The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly.	21.778940125412706
The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn.	100.37661069034189
Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom ’ s plight.	79.44620669507088
The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat.	68.93372223652098
Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply.	81.28185553039447
With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done.	28.172089331398624
With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs.	34.984870475678214
The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane.	240.64941726268512
Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand.	32.301921647293405

The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay.	21.781488035332234
Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen ’ s hat, festooned with shavings, and ashplant, stands irresolute.	104.25660564746217
Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.) _ BLOOM: Eh! Ho! _ (There is no answer; he bends again.) _ Mr Dedalus! _ (There is no answer.) _ The name if you call.	183.28020087145578
Somnambulist.	1218.4197832253003
_ (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) _ Stephen! _ (There is no answer.	77.5900055702922

A dog barks in the distance.	331.7716584284885

_ (Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master.	56.59339192734684
Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand.	18.879085622843004
He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.) _ BLOOM: _ (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) _ Rudy! RUDY: _ (Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom ’ s eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling.	58.0111404240763
He has a delicate mauve face.	69.70496643148911
On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons.	38.147739143019976
In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot.	14.278406590480067
A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.) _ Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.	32.12157204203058
His (Stephen ’ s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman ’ s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral.	31.937314045083713
But how to get there was the rub.	285.23919240476766
For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned.	21.78874964580082
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier ’ s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin ’ s.	33.802265423428686
But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.	20.755055221882596
This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did.	72.86928700631051
So, bevelling around by Mullett ’ s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance.	56.38435135613955
So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey.	20.59738017657405
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company ’ s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back.	34.89119010171166
They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.	28.950553513490057
Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird ’ s the stonecutter ’ s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke ’ s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable.	24.332200744567263
Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke ’ s the baker ’ s it is said.	110.80561755473089
_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn ’ t look out.	38.6389718774659
Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about.	38.125913193085836
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot.	40.25593720830161
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes.	41.74579863924421
Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything.	9.997915165791648
You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £.	79.44988947281566
s.	184.8238270085425
d.	12.98941811261365
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically.	23.988694502204655
Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.	78.09213420660842
— And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.	111.89165629450237
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps.	20.622634631026596
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox.	59.18139043099151
He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father ’ s, Gumley.	25.737536761301104
To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.	148.96276284613796
— Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.	203.15270184683544
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling: — Night! Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment.	49.9205608545219
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least.	20.017165503398555
Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment ’ s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.	13.970135781701646
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley ’ s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice.	72.62935856818355
Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise.	44.05086128400097
His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.	14.131604469598303
Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen.	23.521225739002148
This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.	9.57259663705267
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.	17.239557425861896
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night ’ s lodgings.	95.71877420323501
His friends had all deserted him.	75.72651898146427
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions.	61.53139603944756
He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God ’ s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do.	54.500669689009705
No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn ’ t a complete fabrication from start to finish.	102.25254797978575
Anyhow he was all in.	324.5162558593244
— I wouldn ’ t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I ’ m on the rocks.	39.90708503189611
— There ’ ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys ’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher.	186.76699812644762
Try it.	80.14950891064109
You may mention my name.	123.18808945976934
— Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn ’ t teach in a school, man.	154.51897006054773
I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.	52.65190141285594
I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers.	273.98770535684616
— I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.	109.621117304279
Corley at the first go - off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street.	41.45184564954491
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney ’ s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M ’ Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob.	31.09759387104414
He was starving too though he hadn ’ t said a word about it.	75.28722571818521
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen ’ s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley ’ s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence.	27.085815895580147
However _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished.	25.148917639954043
But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley ’ s head that he was living in affluence and hadn ’ t a thing to do but hand out the needful.	85.10367473733108
Whereas.	724.3403374961829
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing.	63.34485084664853
A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.	204.22950187477642
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact.	29.93130652395228
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.	30.069611350963754
About biscuits he dimly remembered.	25.770419432100677
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy.	34.057020285847145
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.	31.916511143705385
— Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.	108.63073583830828
And so in point of fact they turned out to be.	35.87891258745902
Stephen anyhow lent him one of them.	149.78114740488687
— Thanks, Corley answered, you ’ re a gentleman.	105.86123583512166
I ’ ll pay you back one time.	102.11073010913017
Who ’ s that with you?	636.0093654065881
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.	121.00370543609469
You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there.	202.541345227936
I ’ d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they ’ re full up for the next three weeks, man.	71.4903710235257
God, you ’ ve to book ahead, man, you ’ d think it was for the Carl Rosa.	107.3753462802479
I don ’ t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.	48.1996921747709
Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.	28.323713177333403
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman ’ s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept.	31.56260484851183
He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen ’ s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.	29.571985858783798
Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity.	24.939758208911744
Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether.	90.23003162179585
In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.	71.83461944688584
Pretty thick that was certainly.	269.3556220896217
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite.	105.23897335417885
Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is: — He is down on his luck.	231.9525908940758
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.	55.46002662414973
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively: — Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say.	35.10914525002339
Now you mention it his face was familiar to me.	65.24974019425333
But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?	73.99074186851544
— Half a crown, Stephen responded.	83.16349534065104
I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.	163.90023545754437
— Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does.	75.22000875986596
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds.	38.06571589051276
But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself?	28.854125990970925
Walking to Sandycove is out of the question.	65.55769019876813
And even supposing you did you won ’ t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station.	40.24675767257327
Simply fag out there for nothing.	205.34020339796598
I don ’ t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father ’ s house?	75.38379783751489
— To seek misfortune, was Stephen ’ s answer.	170.38395535278244
— I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday.	62.58244052184188
Where does he live at present?	99.81216929382856
I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.	339.2088644501742
— I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.	304.8541738026114
Why?	2421.489910325178
— A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one.	57.814616651532326
He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you.	89.3400266511519
You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.	51.99369011206179
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen ’ s mind ’ s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that.	37.22129023842372
— No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn ’ t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes.	116.52701211815021
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.	21.18912746957059
Of course you didn ’ t notice as much as I did.	42.33066541498333
But it wouldn ’ t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.	39.465726943696524
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.	28.636690800325706
— Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.	123.22105098762822
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen ’ s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less.	24.786488596024522
Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.	39.073514216056864
Adjacent to the men ’ s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.	16.448808917899076
— _Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione?	25.5266861172918
Culo rotto! _ _ — Intendiamoci.	99.26416927714916
Mezzo sovrano più... _ _ — Dice lui, però! _ _ — <URL> _ — Farabutto! Mortacci sui! _ _ — Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più... _ Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman ’ s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin - the - Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in.	34.02872944391691
A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.	10.050724132690052
— Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.	47.04273959841533
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly.	14.614270754780142
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.	11.217374739764134
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious: — A beautiful language.	30.56022667502428
I mean for singing purposes.	113.42289844443611
Why do you not write your poetry in that language?	54.33843907453162
_Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious and full.	80.90751911426229
_Belladonna.	1218.4197832253003
<URL> Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied: — To fill the ear of a cow elephant.	36.25285466528017
They were haggling over money.	64.7358603292797
— Is that so?	1258.6180502283858
Mr Bloom asked.	160.51135127088145
Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.	17.190369546548922
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête - à - tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.	37.55567166643018
After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to.	40.73139831222156
For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.	25.709955587132626
— Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names.	52.60048273635489
Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody.	84.9462995027302
Jesus, Mr Doyle.	1677.4828259478168
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies.	38.34264001871073
What ’ s in a name?	271.3204329051532
— Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred.	201.10648656740088
Of course.	171.43075195916686
Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.	17.126638702684065
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking: — And what might your name be?	40.833997976528856
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion ’ s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered: — Dedalus.	74.12799769491947
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.	12.92582595034564
— You know Simon Dedalus?	475.86019999655275
he asked at length.	64.27526238621336
— I ’ ve heard of him, Stephen said.	283.50850770572595
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.	42.31689076468542
— He ’ s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding.	142.05471678433767
All Irish.	264.450856642964
— All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.	159.18002084339918
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark: — I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder.	64.64377393537889
The lefthand dead shot.	190.338094691918
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.	27.413709720067974
— Bottles out there, say.	201.4645539798566
Fifty yards measured.	112.77067707425105
Eggs on the bottles.	676.8330752555285
Cocks his gun over his shoulder.	83.53642281672171
Aims.	1218.4197832253003
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely.	31.67605137343588
Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.	48.58578822950711
— Pom! he then shouted once.	144.01097256590404
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.	17.148516855934204
— Pom! he shouted twice.	195.08686851074438
Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily: _ — Buffalo Bill shoots to kill, Never missed nor he never <URL> A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness ’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.	18.66610129179012
— Long ago?	1087.3098553290918
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.	55.75286804354524
— Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years.	48.88780381074907
He toured the wide world with Hengler ’ s Royal Circus.	89.15617474277198
I seen him do that in Stockholm.	133.55452077066315
— Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.	533.5798112409182
— Murphy ’ s my name, the sailor continued.	339.49843509860716
D.	194.5521629100558
B.	192.1781670529122
Murphy of Carrigaloe.	99.81013979235941
Know where that is?	329.97922630409926
— Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.	259.498596314331
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle.	44.898178407770196
That ’ s where I hails from.	54.31807902693651
I belongs there.	406.852473853128
That ’ s where I hails from.	54.31807902693651
My little woman ’ s down there.	101.03682060460166
She ’ s waiting for me, I know.	958.5677637731931
_For England, home and beauty_.	49.615703818347406
She ’ s my own true wife I haven ’ t seen for seven years now, sailing about.	29.395681189947624
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner ’ s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon.	46.42245690922265
Across the world for a wife.	413.32844516594366
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O ’ Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.	21.998084324857672
Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee.	211.10922318480513
The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections.	62.59092066057033
You little expected me but I ’ ve come to stay and make a fresh start.	48.267563657260496
There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside.	67.64188510435895
Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep.	161.7324018234179
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions.	31.2543415606057
No chair for father.	179.0108624264506
Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, _post mortem_ child.	35.90456991491106
With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable.	40.93776366150932
Grin and bear it.	69.85945832986177
I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W.	31.889750479031722
B.	192.1781670529122
Murphy.	525.8816296405445
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request: — You don ’ t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?	78.30515095811192
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.	33.06594283516652
— Thank you, the sailor said.	565.6499993668283
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded: — We come up this morning eleven o ’ clock.	47.12594296952153
The threemaster _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	49.38678400810932
I shipped to get over.	1014.61492151516
Paid off this afternoon.	98.22689285193539
There ’ s my discharge.	133.74044054674218
See?	19219.468747717227
D.	194.5521629100558
B.	192.1781670529122
Murphy.	525.8816296405445
A.	14508.205342004916
B.	192.1781670529122
S.	189.6702203090223
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.	20.801375355119948
— You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.	176.0105053314301
— Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I ’ ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on.	95.84794463392628
I was in the Red Sea.	660.7113758835146
I was in China and North America and South America.	61.19105894582444
We was chased by pirates one voyage.	53.1165771873172
I seen icebergs plenty, growlers.	51.21485087720586
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship.	111.49985479265638
I seen Russia.	271.61667335085303
_Gospodi pomilyou_.	275.29382542023205
That ’ s how the Russians prays.	87.43313520749653
— You seen queer sights, don ’ t be talking, put in a jarvey.	61.03171012132538
— Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.	124.2482847934199
I seen queer things too, ups and downs.	38.595254504953516
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.	21.657104021412298
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously: — Khaan! Like that.	60.7588669934634
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses.	42.523195460931476
Look here.	308.5832990401189
Here they are.	123.12889640555431
A friend of mine sent me.	101.42537869010381
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.	22.723557268694137
The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios.	88.85550892085968
Beni, <URL> All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.	14.300236105094289
— Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added.	306.27370893437234
Stomachs like breadgraters.	112.77067707425105
Cuts off their diddies when they can ’ t bear no more children.	199.64620906380566
See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse ’ s liver raw.	61.13178392918668
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more.	16.56927351921544
— Know how to keep them off?	205.705598917028
he inquired generally.	117.25996349661706
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying: — Glass.	18.721436178501346
That boggles ’ em.	60.20858556922266
Glass.	888.3498927094821
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.	18.43425066614633
It ran as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, <URL> There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.	16.401755591023893
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo - Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which occasion the former ’ s ball passed through the latter ’ s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict <URL>. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend ’ s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.	28.086979206887168
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through.	25.303027210693955
But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd ’ s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.	42.731784868251935
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with.	23.021000911456202
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.	19.680686271008046
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M ’ Coy type lend me your valise and I ’ ll post you the ticket.	41.75065918710364
No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy - Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody - Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure.	26.868705786755147
That was the rub.	178.2842455963024
Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard - Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally.	27.386152635995217
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.	19.658040469821024
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn ’ t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d ’ œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O ’ Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men ’ s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour ’ s run from the pillar.	19.422341457991834
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired.	79.44979681788487
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact.	18.60908625386392
He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.	245.1913993193819
— I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different.	59.27006002852716
One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower.	47.24893142727242
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.	218.134348761235
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.	31.35551156306203
— And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.	91.09699065800996
Knife in his back.	1130.2663474340118
Knife like that.	397.4960355886628
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.	28.966743467462308
— In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.	66.44209174292018
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.	14.518156432309386
Like that.	83.58182237834879
_Prepare to meet your God_, says he.	32.806173337138375
Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.	285.7605258731526
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to.	15.374795250663373
— That ’ s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable _stiletto_.	67.32165315583971
After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.	12.723291358471489
— They ’ re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all.	89.31961244864826
That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.	56.300662512988005
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin - the - Goat, _alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair.	22.131935094425298
His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn ’ t understand one jot of what was going on.	34.615010167384874
Funny, very! There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.	15.678574612739197
Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.	90.31151256669494
He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.	47.773768969357825
— Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.	170.08300464996577
Give us back them papers.	45.10751823237165
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.	32.06662875858378
— Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar?	65.70402793963419
Mr Bloom inquired.	480.43975768308206
The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no.	28.330107827106726
— Ah, you ’ ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.	98.04618894142304
— What year would that be about?	115.28177932010671
Mr B interrogated.	151.5928623305966
Can you recall the boats?	32.69570302767024
Our _soi - disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering: — I ’ m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.	89.98217705500689
Salt junk all the time.	317.4579626124164
Tired seemingly, he ceased.	322.2737408987583
His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves.	78.91950762647622
On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings.	45.2042684692224
And it left him wondering why.	46.31249511476971
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.	39.24842620724274
And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all.	133.7169039198759
Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.	31.65200424413956
— There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman ’ s valet at six quid a month.	41.76363343650334
Them are his trousers I ’ ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.	100.39657219472613
I ’ m game for that job, shaving and brushup.	44.660245760961715
I hate roaming about.	42.61408563014736
There ’ s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper ’ s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.	61.091903004155185
— What age is he?	200.63817282030146
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.	29.411690130721855
— Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?	51.312876477394354
He ’ d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.	33.278608051928046
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor.	12.215444987427505
— There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.	101.0450906801088
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.	34.064069156054416
It ’ s them black lads I objects to.	35.151653223257895
I hate those buggers.	28.432592693916025
Suck your blood dry, they does.	43.514734680035716
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner ’ s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <NUM> and a young man ’ s sideface looking frowningly rather.	59.48523839908096
— Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.	730.0200786324768
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.	60.58317505325319
Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that.	28.89157968417449
There he is himself, a Greek.	79.68975158529673
one asked the sailor.	91.58089064815702
That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.	53.68947569700039
Someway in his.	1722.1145646650768
Squeezing or.	275.29382542023205
— See here, he said, showing Antonio.	463.52075836077285
There he is cursing the mate.	38.110540216857885
And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.	76.25281543280077
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio ’ s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin - the - Goat, who this time stretched over.	20.136975421662605
— Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.	50.71727990452198
He ’ s gone too.	368.8543824889219
Ate by sharks after.	50.78059647831953
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.	64.16756080697874
— Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.	301.56660040570375
— And what ’ s the number for?	474.4567299561496
loafer number two queried.	62.200804154614865
a third asked the sailor.	55.26445813271253
— Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number.	65.786614349021
Ate.	812.0832237234374
A Greek he was.	576.6848557554932
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.	39.010324907538035
Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink.	63.428350163600086
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of his washing.	70.17911634002205
Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing.	19.452367830666436
Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife ’ s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man ’ s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper ’ s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt.	72.54423621602771
Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female ’ s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off.	54.3284841525535
Round the side of the _Evening Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy ’ s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.	51.71492713898182
— The gunboat, the keeper said.	360.43228129844414
— It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least.	44.67309679445766
Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.	61.276726875503826
Still no matter what the cause is from...	36.80076658772449
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking: — In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade.	41.3629566755084
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul.	17.119228759806436
She is a bad merchant.	230.01858405892227
She buys dear and sells cheap.	78.2959118409428
The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start.	42.22651080160664
Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.	71.14440168517903
— You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul.	330.18508541150226
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup.	90.24954730496742
I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter.	55.97107192713177
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance.	23.259605504798404
Do you?	2122.673239661601
Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say: — They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible.	55.14894632176758
It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette.	30.255068837558238
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining: — Simple?	58.672798602342425
I shouldn ’ t think that is the proper word.	148.3169720385692
Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon.	69.17693748516021
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it ’ s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.	87.79827517131694
— O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.	41.64635335965691
On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.	24.788032714824467
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief.	39.89598295403117
I ’ m not so sure about that.	52.72284234470065
That ’ s a matter for everyman ’ s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_ there.	125.97390064829996
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it ’ s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn ’ t tell you.	46.627084606654975
Can ’ t you drink that coffee, by the way?	97.13307645437042
Let me stir it.	844.1233938476378
And take a piece of that bun.	437.0744997627674
It ’ s like one of our skipper ’ s bricks disguised.	139.62041050430125
Still no - one can give what he hasn ’ t got.	109.93264428456405
Try a bit.	369.3200480722206
— Couldn ’ t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.	296.73267073297353
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders.	17.315033578185524
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying.	62.06165246265549
The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of.	50.89753582101633
Sulphate of copper poison SO<NUM> or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn ’ t remember when it was or where.	30.93404203115663
Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble ’ s Vi - Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.	55.616790765578784
— Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.	324.84572308903597
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.	38.30909973800056
— Still it ’ s solid food, his good genius urged, I ’ m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental or manual.	32.85695424847133
You ought to eat more solid food.	114.83816519786521
You would feel a different man.	94.01194615492878
— Liquids I can eat, Stephen said.	281.33364246176956
But O, oblige me by taking away that knife.	60.24281529882615
I can ’ t look at the point of it.	1605.4756211218223
It reminds me of Roman history.	45.257568873758075
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.	29.942035644688474
— Our mutual friend ’ s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_.	51.3346562593492
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots.	18.020958888763236
Look at him.	394.1100777719708
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.	19.543083606590017
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.	64.87456064955134
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.	19.848676554486193
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described.	24.846300264278877
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera.	19.723194662210496
And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn ’ t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.	23.586240956226174
— Mind you, I ’ m not saying that it ’ s all a pure invention, he resumed.	227.42597869459624
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.	22.293580535689422
Giants, though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen.	36.04396950986825
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn ’ t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods.	33.03939574708804
There ’ s an example again of simple souls.	37.143350668526566
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded.	24.27915643890986
On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.	22.003919759332113
— Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen.	53.771014070985295
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.	45.50913372032958
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is.	59.724451300820796
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, <URL>. Gibraltar.	17.856422817811872
She has the Spanish type.	188.90250031069883
Quite dark, regular brunette, black.	34.084051356249276
I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character.	37.906652802856804
That ’ s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.	70.81313128358849
— The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings.	46.38375823090737
_Roberto ruba roba sua_.	62.200804154614865
— Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.	1916.2167093808077
— Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.	26.531001718596634
— It ’ s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.	342.87359364303643
All are washed in the blood of the sun.	95.4978950653223
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there.	64.99665923289534
The splendid proportions of hips, bosom.	52.52869458112032
You simply don ’ t knock against those kind of women here.	103.31519496765742
An exception here and there.	221.8096078245752
Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I ’ m talking about is the female form.	47.905115385197774
Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman ’ s natural beauty, no matter what you say.	31.29165637882324
Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it ’ s a thing I simply hate to see.	42.67971354816658
Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.	20.301421551990924
Shipahoy of course had his own say to say.	244.67272218878438
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.	41.62963010849251
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt ’ s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand.	39.014469858369075
That was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror.	28.397982606070933
Then someone said something about the case of the s.	424.02295554161503
s.	184.8238270085425
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck.	21.996435703725755
No aid was given.	241.30774429062194
Her master, the _Mona_ ’ s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.	101.80672117755785
She had no water, it appears, in her hold.	98.56326168562117
At this stage an incident happened.	59.479667242743645
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.	32.060830647454445
— Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.	151.19894016081747
He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left.	53.50029521408095
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship ’ s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise.	60.50817299598438
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.	35.395132569926226
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.	40.55381623120194
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.	19.312204889945168
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ <NUM> a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.	17.43821894658315
And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver.	29.31682510073622
He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if — a big if, however — he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.	39.21135906513839
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing.	24.084523275444393
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year.	41.20409835506226
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.	16.819763090977016
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh?	17.00805577373312
Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day ’ s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.	43.64884730957089
— Am I right, skipper?	181.19066337487075
he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.	104.71164009866331
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds.	34.89926505212807
Mr Bloom ’ s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question.	63.91459860441127
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation - _cum_ - potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook: — The biscuits was as hard as brass And the beef as salt as Lot ’ s wife ’ s arse.	24.02028112949173
Skin - the - Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible - feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God ’ s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein.	33.940219265107956
Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact.	51.22982508953958
You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.	71.38162107492255
But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes.	28.668632171205907
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.	68.94155171655449
The Boers were the beginning of the end.	314.4345106727033
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot.	38.77586528255334
His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.	47.74723034205193
Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.	73.65424026035352
Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_.	77.96630356502189
The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.	31.5378940370071
— Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.	56.67350421830593
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.	53.21482802181071
— Who ’ s the best troops in the army?	333.89020856770276
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated.	24.666848150834568
And the best jumpers and racers?	70.82150937973071
And the best admirals and generals we ’ ve got?	57.8055201730227
Tell me that.	108.17040509041475
— The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.	37.77919160817207
— That ’ s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.	278.69111940945066
The Irish catholic peasant.	166.25551450262674
He ’ s the backbone of our empire.	140.77028002974643
You know Jem Mullins?	166.28152357949256
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.	19.41293496059276
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn ’ t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.	32.9641291561695
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.	20.84965751444876
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart.	38.22430896915105
Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact.	27.63589414956705
And now, why?	174.5921102217787
So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.	76.69889337685296
And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn ’ t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn ’ t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen ’ s evidence or king ’ s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.	44.177413708138296
Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.	25.64534682417845
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin - the - Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.	22.702735540330917
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin - the - etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.	81.11716576132515
He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.	58.06146629576081
Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.	15.004607529304337
Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.	262.13467975466773
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £.	45.90278213258069
s.	184.8238270085425
d.	12.98941811261365
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin and so on.	103.84122413340395
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.	80.70256369180167
— He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.	267.9061716000663
He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively.	118.11668676537009
So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I ’ m not.	48.58439398270016
A soft answer turns away wrath.	49.533562430465174
He hadn ’ t a word to say for himself as everyone saw.	139.6955134898406
Am I not right?	38.285231267983775
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn ’ t all exactly.	44.0590566033275
— _Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any other, _secundum carnem_.	20.399879210942
— Of course, Mr B.	687.4163806198344
proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question.	76.2370143347173
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves.	20.81383311116097
But with a little goodwill all round.	124.32459068202618
It ’ s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.	18.32910962825326
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form.	34.69705848647368
It never reaches anything or stops anything.	21.182416094029577
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan.	127.10850931343468
It ’ s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak.	68.64263320076832
— Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes ’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner ’ s alley and Ormond market.	32.648185807137246
And the whole world was full of that sort of thing.	84.20918879928462
— You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.	200.04415565901635
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn ’ t remotely...	39.82126192800043
All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.	19.030289970961967
— They accuse, remarked he audibly.	68.0567052117014
He turned away from the others, who probably … and spoke nearer to, so as the others … in case they … — Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen ’ s ear, are accused of ruining.	45.09185834603673
History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them.	13.108083037748127
Why?	2421.489910325178
Because they are imbued with the proper spirit.	67.95542882881125
They are practical and are proved to be so.	41.56083731757943
I don ’ t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are.	92.70641740321713
But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty.	104.88645685493759
Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America.	194.28495948143245
Turks.	1218.4197832253003
It ’ s in the dogma.	366.40443569670475
Because if they didn ’ t believe they ’ d go straight to heaven when they die they ’ d try to live better, at least so I think.	29.890354375563085
That ’ s the juggle on which the <URL>. ’ s raise the wind on false pretences.	104.75324933554627
I ’ m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ <NUM> per annum.	32.59473566462311
That ’ s the vital issue at stake and it ’ s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man.	31.987807515438657
At least that ’ s my idea for what it ’ s worth.	367.70052639610975
I call that patriotism.	242.37815914614407
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_.	13.266304002499153
Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.	205.23322899964182
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.	42.154821306079974
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to.	39.147798734207775
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn ’ t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.	62.51681121109488
— Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.	130.50820691715694
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem.	46.04984067479421
observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.	77.94761725514377
— I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense.	170.5204760306564
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing.	109.4474238369868
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.	74.2013086324074
That ’ s work too.	147.4792285534821
Important work.	275.29382542023205
After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price.	55.66949798225983
You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.	27.63072802272477
What?	1560.489681896445
You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.	347.6015091767194
Each is equally important.	53.11162088141111
— You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called Ireland for short.	41.142854025320986
— I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.	400.12510801704894
— But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.	75.52292663478771
— What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension.	69.70193131649495
Excuse me.	119.21602448045265
What was it you...?	709.6736021042148
Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: — We can ’ t change the country.	28.87481135139345
Let us change the subject.	140.62111305613718
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn ’ t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry.	35.026159958143154
The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part.	56.36476285869321
Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state.	37.7397895578707
Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn ’ t been familiarised with the right sort of people.	37.510182523015345
With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves.	34.49874163457016
For instance there was the case of O ’ Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact).	25.514868794646592
And then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.	15.494947380513487
Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it.	34.45087551885971
Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental.	27.837086675486585
However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps.	55.56568992434351
Sheer force of natural genius, that.	29.097067385172966
With brains, sir.	728.2662412558568
For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it.	19.462958782187023
Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small.	7.900885277266371
Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind.	83.63612118550746
Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz.	34.094097275265

To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column.	32.71727601230684

Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though as the event turned out the poor fool hadn ’ t much reason to congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope.	34.98315951659522
Guesswork it reduced itself to eventually.	32.24218854309747
— There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.	234.20908959523305
— Who?	969.1116642327058
the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.	62.71012360752619
One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read: _Return of Parnell_.	118.26032946324452
He bet them what they liked.	432.5689631766514
A Dublin fusilier was in that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa.	238.0239751260133
Pride it was killed him.	119.13230389263207
He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after committee room no <NUM> until he was his old self again with no - one to point a finger at him.	41.8684290099204
Then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his senses.	106.88801906919588
Dead he wasn ’ t.	107.37178612880909
Simply absconded somewhere.	88.40530891686868
The coffin they brought over was full of stones.	40.92334688952194
He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general.	216.7581302690999
He made a mistake to fight the priests.	19.539277142063444
And so forth and so on.	55.654866649671014
All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years.	23.2696673655947
Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered.	95.69602491148525
Something evidently riled them in his death.	141.39147727456682
Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands.	12.245445104172292
Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility.	16.09029675768646
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren ’ t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between.	26.389985796102195
It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging.	64.5729575644553
And the identical same with murderers.	52.589917464550496
You had to come back.	2685.1568958897424
That haunting sense kind of drew you.	44.28716431641931
To show the understudy in the title _rôle_ how to.	159.46890194958735
He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_ or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what ’ s bred in the bone.	45.34352930696079
Still as regards return.	57.925318299048214
You were a lucky dog if they didn ’ t set the terrier at you directly you got back.	45.674174798564565
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against.	20.570637595930645
And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat ’ s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or some such commonplace remark.	74.52831255454525
A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.	73.10300361156604
— That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented.	117.71414084712248
She put the first nail in his coffin.	219.10736614525558
— Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi - disant_ townclerk Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her.	112.10622636128743
She loosened many a man ’ s thighs.	250.7728162141322
I seen her picture in a barber ’ s.	131.2262112525883
The husband was a captain or an officer.	99.23309834566219
— Ay, Skin - the - Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.	123.25740772677153
This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_.	19.220496794714922
As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings.	32.62641074529187
First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into.	25.66267658578014
Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of.	32.56665451882158
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one ’ s smiles.	59.483182891401675
Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk?	32.40878350672481
Poser.	1218.4197832253003
Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly.	15.766720958865298
A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the <NUM> th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass ’ s kick.	45.03850363405248
Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream.	26.37501325108012
And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times.	34.51344525272347
Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side.	42.85841710904743
North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn ’ t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.	24.989996478634893
— Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun.	136.25037851683683
And, if I don ’ t greatly mistake she was Spanish too.	147.87079461661065
— The king of Spain ’ s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.	35.61641796970356
— Was she?	576.0151461772305
Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour before.	41.13802905210846
Possible, especially there, it was as she lived there.	69.96379269759092
So, Spain.	493.2497624488726
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he.	34.58855753028017
— Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?	137.8697090961976
Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue.	31.218069464395192
Her (the lady ’ s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin ’ s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.	39.866355476366934
— Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated.	88.88738607569779
Taken a few years since.	56.97596838254165
In or about ninety six.	130.4832221872335
Very like her then.	54.3597862473404
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen.	21.641857454802793
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup.	58.71019656677544
She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the.	211.23617067330463
He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum.	43.73319432070771
Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest.	71.23899008343412
Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint Joseph ’ s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop.	50.809579599165325
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn ’ t art in a word.	54.96627797747472
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar ’ s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to.	38.242544823179486
But it was scarcely professional etiquette so.	64.72192637648287
Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.	47.32916744275574
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.	40.46206905488024
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other ’ s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_.	16.292377822804397
In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out.	26.787191002106006
Suppose she was gone when he?	119.22667169405976
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.	29.046248894317714
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn ’ t think he had it in him yet you would.	63.86853450409059
Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter.	126.08125929614722
And why not?	349.829011915022
How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate.	14.203519561857812
But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course.	36.77283958091095
He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin ’ s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader ’ s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader ’ s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O ’ Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune ’ s private morals.	54.6230850478091
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive.	10.421640577498868
As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap ’ s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character.	50.93396960416668
His hat (Parnell ’ s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what ’ s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother ’ s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.	54.58570417301424
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another ’ s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others.	30.581695401605657
He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn ’ t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.	25.685488607791555
It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime.	13.514823514119243
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies ’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ’ ways and flowers and chocs.	24.953274172366275
To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age.	27.450951125237463
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other ’ s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.	20.099918658849045
— At what o ’ clock did you dine?	73.93701442927802
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.	51.56055925595663
— Some time yesterday, Stephen said.	89.86967561687274
— Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday.	47.583165378686644
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.	25.23396875951011
Though they didn ’ t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought.	26.71594074673562
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.	17.96262982847175
For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people ’ s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn ’ t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan ’ s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	27.706673224029675
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night.	39.167988676104436
On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives.	127.54718509490638
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.	111.3036311129438
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway.	85.21894651801021
For one thing he mightn ’ t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn ’ t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.	42.32756887071827
At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps ’ s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.	23.89340273083256
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn ’ t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger ’ s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character ’ s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids ’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody ’ s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks _passim_.	22.32295857631163
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.	69.20015310452995
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep.	32.04235255866221
The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles.	52.35382912677888
Your god was a jew.	170.99251051932552
Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick - on - Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.	27.457070414719016
— I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it ’ s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over.	25.01501618147391
My diggings are quite close in the vicinity.	32.77460821865416
You can ’ t drink that stuff.	202.63101423446068
Do you like cocoa?	2351.8985467670313
Wait.	199.9002065950114
I ’ ll just pay this lot.	92.54347839748017
The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn ’ t seem to.	60.11153372399683
— Yes, that ’ s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.	72.03315141724194
An opening was all was wanted.	135.19838413722684
Because he more than suspected he had his father ’ s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.	62.870562245143546
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers ’ association dinner in London somewhere.	108.60950484727923
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary ’ s lodge or words to that effect.	43.64982688645333
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.	32.2986165268984
— Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.	33.0754753976284
— And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.	75.47445556938546
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.	32.27522708660784
— Are you bad in the eyes?	1799.325050301351
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried.	40.5545722641768
— Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.	43.58282723327956
Sand in the Red Sea done that.	118.96270058358718
One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking.	56.00813540240856
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite and _Red as a Rose is <URL> Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.	13.440349816755472
To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee <NUM> d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.	23.328499577882067
— Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.	144.43651475571508
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_.	22.983566889378572
Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.	204.75158904662047
— One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment.	338.08080713872226
Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés.	111.6072362658706
To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment ’ s hesitation, saying straight off: — To sweep the floor in the morning.	62.46080378821034
So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion ’ s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles.	124.33367468204855
The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.	43.69753139925913
— It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment.	213.50175115591105
The only thing is to walk then you ’ ll feel a different man.	107.36712227889109
Come.	232.90336313975413
It ’ s not far.	138.15809366212997
Lean on me.	105.74138899156505
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen ’ s right and led him on accordingly.	97.20163151827408
— Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.	72.96079397953916
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc.	19.339881646363125
where the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new.	22.65150135956149
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.	38.99810349210304
So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place.	41.71097377755483
Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go - off but the music of Mercadante ’ s _Huguenots_, Meyerbeer ’ s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart ’ s _Twelfth Mass_ he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat.	39.35916685199486
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be_.	22.848338611174608
He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini ’ s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers ’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather.	50.56491748265378
There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore.	53.371510436840694
On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_, a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn.	57.39679215912345
And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel ’ s air in _Martha, M ’ appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen ’ s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.	56.0993230317003
Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn ’ t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare ’ s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B.	28.151536376036876
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen ’ s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.	22.954693598783066
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.	20.455785430392456
He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.	61.90999166527359
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other ’ s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking: — Our lives are in peril tonight.	34.86476320867526
Beware of the steamroller.	715.8125566922162
They thereupon stopped.	388.4732539117065
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts.	36.44221499312877
He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world.	95.03801870153421
But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan ’ s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face.	67.62816859728238
But it was no animal ’ s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.	66.63882893757237
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees.	10.594574685255516
Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye.	31.83761647600317
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen ’ s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.	41.27059745113048
— What ’ s this I was saying?	256.3762485268979
Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.	20.641036283404176
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.	53.265736199076095
Still, supposing he had his father ’ s gift as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall ’ s Irish industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.	70.70306598541593
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from.	15.89701341880964
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit: Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten.	26.182490173169334
These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_.	16.169416871961936
Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did.	63.093353447685516
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B.	19.146034764337738
A.	14508.205342004916
(a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society ’ s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you.	24.264022574801785
Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.	29.47090438853237
Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time.	44.498403526685834
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.	21.08826118755892
Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin ’ s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_.	17.278467116789155
Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city ’ s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows.	42.105351323154544
And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone.	25.705224666103916
The horse was just then.	779.6910246427667
And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom ’ s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person ’ s character, no pun intended.	40.6480859523539
The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds.	20.255412422087886
Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired.	50.39904561570012
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.	38.016704730200516
Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.	74.7803262611241
Und alle Schiffe brücken.	62.200804154614865
The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by Father Maher_.	42.337514082425756
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies of man ’ s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn ’ t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.	36.494531208192036
What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?	59.3357365996548
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner ’ s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.	14.475807388404908
Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George ’ s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.	21.364798758650533
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?	19.6533032573716
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen ’ s collapse.	44.470885297334995
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?	10.253577040175735
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial.	8.751028335668078
Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence.	32.09921701153768
Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines.	6.601982502465952
Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.	12.44052280167312
Were their views on some points divergent?	92.03422271030014
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom ’ s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen ’ s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.	59.8585575939815
Bloom assented covertly to Stephen ’ s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year <NUM> in the reign of Leary to the year <NUM> or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt († <NUM> <URL>.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree.	36.889366286922765
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman ’ s hand.	14.215368044256177
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?	33.51904622363774
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.	39.89946796532571
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?	41.94476495710945
In <NUM> with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard ’ s corner and Leonard ’ s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.	14.100828977033125
In <NUM> with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross.	20.516992032133697
In <NUM> occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines.	12.030389874826978
In <NUM> frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon ’ s house in Roundtown.	22.31154450947554
Once in <NUM> and once in <NUM> with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom ’ s) house in Lombard street, west.	54.05258153455583
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?	47.79651681727245
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.	43.07090238376819
As in what ways?	63.51839022182701
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.	19.910982046627893
At the housesteps of the <NUM> th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number <NUM> Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.	72.71059861713911
Was it there?	82.80356425948202
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.	347.4150106162694
Why was he doubly irritated?	48.644247869059626
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.	78.85230332338318
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?	38.05710085984328
To enter or not to enter.	179.2893754768263
To knock or not to knock.	174.3575680443568
Bloom ’ s decision?	312.8293969725228
A stratagem.	1047.493585384237
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.	26.275989544323178
Did he fall?	65.78286722324738
By his body ’ s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of <NUM> Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number <NUM>, epact <NUM>, solar cycle <NUM>, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction <NUM>, Julian period <NUM>, MCMIV.	24.983088137390276
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?	21.110263080188375
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?	32.8506624360686
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of <NUM> CP, a man lighting a candle of <NUM> CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle.	23.30851063796761
Did the man reappear elsewhere?	259.6672104540207
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor.	26.32725350601822
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.	65.58894614155709
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.	135.91847084470066
Did Stephen obey his sign?	35.11766078050778
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man ’ s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom ’ s house.	39.64526136344142
What did Bloom do?	688.2715459134139
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M ’ Donald of <NUM> D ’ Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.	18.271456930001303
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?	23.66236896608062
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at <NUM> Usher ’ s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at <NUM> Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier <NUM>: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics ’ theatre of university College, <NUM> Stephen ’ s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father ’ s house in Cabra.	42.689286089632446
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?	98.19515422839889
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies ’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.	12.295054104007502
What did Bloom see on the range?	724.6733336796265
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.	25.429148446910013
What did Bloom do at the range?	495.76815846294414
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.	32.831594637285285
Yes.	1763.135277433406
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of <NUM> million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ <NUM> per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the <NUM> acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of <NUM> statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of <NUM> feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of <NUM> / <NUM> million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.	18.4951066715137
E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in <NUM>) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of <NUM> gallons per day per pauper supplied through a <NUM> inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of <NUM> gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.	23.86357979026526
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?	30.52619103047005
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator ’ s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding <NUM> fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of <NUM> to <NUM> over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting <NUM> % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine % marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.	8.859669919873557
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?	26.307997670197047
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington ’ s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.	15.958021742819053
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom ’ s offer?	84.98622480591551
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.	16.364386304276923
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?	19.04128376514407
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.	41.95368014348028
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?	50.24220446769557
Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.	81.21212229105392
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?	144.84886899661575
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.	18.978656384711908
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?	97.71614709781049
The phenomenon of ebullition.	190.338094691918
Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether.	9.495629721886218
Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of <NUM> thermal units needed to raise <NUM> pound of water from <NUM> ° to <NUM> ° Fahrenheit.	21.100082465887702
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?	44.55042528898404
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.	22.96032971986892
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?	28.027451500597746
To shave himself.	508.4826412561312
What advantages attended shaving by night?	77.5391921575551
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman ’ s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.	12.456883443636318
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?	77.00886611275041
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.	88.11388811895145
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?	44.70326564969175
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.	24.475043819319797
What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?	55.956220683629496
On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits.	13.5747112717699
On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences.	16.208263292768198
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?	278.2952573860902
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered <NUM>, <NUM>.	19.623289597824474
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?	93.63267659441152
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_, late pink edition, in the cabman ’ s shelter, at Butt bridge.	50.09371213671044
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?	76.67257471320437
In Bernard Kiernan ’ s licensed premises <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street: in David Byrne ’ s licensed premises, <NUM> Duke street: in O ’ Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon ’ s when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F.	39.34149584969936
W.	434.0547808005836
Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M.	129.4083996032577
(Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the _Freeman ’ s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, <NUM> Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.	50.24105645739766
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?	66.34642641311493
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.	9.75847811568569
His mood?	1322.4554482011363
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.	155.93357777868337
What satisfied him?	411.29820793932646
To have sustained no positive loss.	76.68292543023767
Light to the gentiles.	332.51352816152763
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?	78.72952617011701
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps ’ s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.	42.17892745184373
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?	37.45896957288192
Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).	46.45052970760211
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?	30.163199868936587
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps ’ s massproduct, the creature cocoa.	60.84974539485385
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?	24.1672584932423
The reparation of a fissure of the length of <NUM> / <NUM> inches in the right side of his guest ’ s jacket.	310.73583563372875
A gift to his guest of one of the four lady ’ s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.	78.93064557271195
Who drank more quickly?	227.65090894548115
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent ’ s one, six to two, nine to three.	27.600214357078993
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?	66.34642641311493
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.	14.492076235796874
Had he found their solution?	34.33302575320318
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points.	46.678598928850114
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of <NUM> in <NUM> on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of <NUM> / -, <NUM> / - and <NUM> respectively for competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?	75.87092076921476
An ambition to squint At my verses in print Makes me hope that for these you ’ ll find room.	34.47011281450313
If you so condescend Then please place at the end The name of yours truly, L.	17.36391388084943
Bloom.	2255.397063679651
Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?	13.689108519667238
Name, age, race, creed.	34.83475470494393
What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?	1055.4595265871378
Leopold Bloom Ellpodbomool Molldopeloob Bollopedoom Old Ollebo, M.	14.741894628258716
P.	2048.366095404317
What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the <NUM> February <NUM>?	32.75813540226862
Poets oft have sung in rhyme Of music sweet their praise divine.	11.363437996179488
Let them hymn it nine times nine.	16.302009712882864
Dearer far than song or wine.	30.198099487077098
You are mine.	256.8779018748615
The world is mine.	193.42640407109081
What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R.	18.22428714874776
G.	431.02315507406894
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (<NUM> January <NUM>) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.	43.13268399527143
Shelton <NUM> December <NUM>, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A.	29.729544133059697
Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal girl?	10.650084301313745
Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born <NUM>, acceded <NUM>) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist ’ s non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist ’ s revelations of white articles of non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from _Everybody ’ s Book of Jokes_ (<NUM> pages and a laugh in every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.	19.559957240452224
What relation existed between their ages?	90.51388197347949
<NUM> years before in <NUM> when Bloom was of Stephen ’ s present age Stephen was <NUM>.	61.55215410187388
<NUM> years after in <NUM> when Stephen would be of Bloom ’ s present age Bloom would be <NUM>.	59.07561717345625
The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.	44.61811625584035
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?	15.838985835427922
The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon ’ s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s mother, Stephen being then of the age of <NUM> and reluctant to give his hand in salutation.	48.9972930847742
The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin ’ s hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s father and Stephen ’ s granduncle, Stephen being then <NUM> years older.	102.61623931578335
Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?	57.8834448524676
Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.	31.59340565694303
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?	26.128470997504774
Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen ’ s parents from <NUM> September <NUM> to <NUM> December <NUM> and had also resided during the years <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O ’ Dowd of <NUM> Prussia street where, during parts of the years <NUM> and <NUM>, she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of <NUM> Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.	48.0088526152911
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?	30.73021885969187
He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low ’ s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.	14.97892145472283
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?	48.497820068411144
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.	17.82102282183136
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?	39.89689065688527
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.	17.786860119600963
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?	27.50290756704622
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow ’ s _Physical Strength and How to Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.	14.833273863691751
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?	17.272180527733955
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.	47.289628269465524
Did either openly allude to their racial difference?	26.69016986618399
Neither.	724.3403374961829
What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom ’ s thoughts about Stephen ’ s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen ’ s thoughts about Bloom ’ s thoughts about Stephen?	44.83066094284708
He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.	301.17528247345007
What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?	65.78169533465727
Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty).	18.439564528584917
Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).	16.27900710433096
Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?	53.94629685492404
Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M.	78.85659762061628
A., alone, in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James O ’ Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C.	36.852237956191544
C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	178.2920446669418
Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone C.	88.11664345767706
C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	99.98067916092283
Did they find their educational careers similar?	25.454547144305657
Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame ’ s school and the high school.	48.29735206157965
Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university.	30.393635601500144
Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?	180.3588714267718
Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.	78.03850976791172
What two temperaments did they individually represent?	49.440126212432844
The scientific.	1473.6388010057888
The artistic.	1473.6388010057888
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?	16.89447240262642
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.	36.208698185817056
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?	70.32357549146005
Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults.	18.282888356848005
They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.	8.708962769676711
What also stimulated him in his cogitations?	215.21403876711588
The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A.	46.928245532261705
James, the former by his <NUM> d bazaar at <NUM> George ’ s street, south, the latter at his <NUM> / <NUM> d shop and world ’ s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at <NUM> Henry street, admission <NUM> d, children <NUM> d: and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.	24.485854451922233

Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?	10.212805715429962
His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.	17.729109878327392
What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?	42.413993025410406
Solitary hotel in mountain pass.	41.14870804475244

What?	1560.489681896445
In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel.	75.57648609403233
Queen ’ s Ho...	223.0647193114468
What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?	39.29977269874977
The Queen ’ s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the <NUM> June <NUM>, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of <NUM> parts of aconite liniment to <NUM> of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at <URL> <URL>. on the morning of <NUM> June <NUM> at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, <NUM> Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at <URL> <URL>. on the afternoon of <NUM> June <NUM> a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, <NUM> Main street, Ennis.	37.04504587159399
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?	10.18758186166803
Coincidence.	440.858884305153
He preferred himself to see another ’ s face and listen to another ’ s words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.	54.91659563696798
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of the Plums_?	59.22251863550125
It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (<URL>. _My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon ’ s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, <NUM> June (S.	10.69451448960179
Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise <URL> <URL>., sunset <URL> <URL>. Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?	23.823609970734584
What to do with our wives.	139.6066565513061
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?	71.98534643783523
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.	6.087072507685631
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?	123.06243403095716
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters.	15.689554048447597
She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec.	26.625563616728314
She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external.	21.568002112803917
In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.	16.71378433605983
After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall.	16.1088257219824
Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_ (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).	10.152005830496723
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?	31.80050601668263
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction.	65.46294102229805
The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.	23.657870351712443
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?	17.422359130610158
Variously.	1218.4197832253003
By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other ’ s ignorant lapse.	24.106151837731137
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?	14.692334292660895
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.	25.781642612597043
What system had proved more effective?	66.34642641311493
Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.	62.200804154614865
Example?	1218.4197832253003
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.	64.92841611867888
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest ’ s parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?	47.06857466289318
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).	17.801328962248142
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?	28.120194787779308
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.	19.347933371502297
Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?	59.57291709307347
Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).	12.188237327643362
What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?	18.734497957219393
By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_ (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).	10.321384671143141
By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m ’ baad l ’ zamatejch_ (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).	13.070711653516847
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?	60.57755629888323
By juxtaposition.	238.4019033834774
On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, and <NUM>.	19.071279405162137
Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?	49.93119781331869
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.	11.411886996687299
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?	22.37343709386804
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar <NUM> years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S.	8.97497009343091
Mary ’ s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve ’ s tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.	23.971959259008422
Kolod balejwaw pnimah Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.	18.92324544513634
Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?	41.24700789140291
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?	20.712586193554746
By a periphrastic version of the general text.	75.08237284790499
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?	22.335996768939182
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).	29.86875405421213
Did the guest comply with his host ’ s request?	110.23490016876895
Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.	25.192859119860486
What was Stephen ’ s auditive sensation?	715.0594322688397
He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.	47.58748127946141
What was Bloom ’ s visual sensation?	807.8962876130632
He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.	35.500204059235955
What were Stephen ’ s and Bloom ’ s quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?	86.40339662209894
Visually, Stephen ’ s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.	13.013498472385983
What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?	93.22685057757815
In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.	14.506381477137804
J., the reverend T.	183.2921773171589

At the bar, English or Irish: exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K.	20.115570774551045
C., Rufus Isaacs, K.	28.77279654601441
C.	213.99259247746502
On the stage, modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle († <NUM>), exponent of Shakespeare.	12.21302223388644
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?	15.836442390985436
Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.	13.11180689726222
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.	70.49735533283814
Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball.	28.40205975241296
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played He drove it o ’ er the jew ’ s garden wall.	22.321323047321247
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played He broke the jew ’ s windows all.	35.54723539443276
How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?	28.789901952198544
With unmixed feeling.	459.52405000305345
Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.	56.050675534505466
Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.	78.37012316344186
Then out there came the jew ’ s daughter And she all dressed in green.	95.17670587849307
“ Come back, come back, you pretty little boy, And play your ball again. ” I can ’ t come back and I won ’ t come back Without my schoolfellows all.	22.76807279132611
For if my master he did hear He ’ d make it a sorry ball. ” She took him by the lilywhite hand And led him along the hall Until she led him to a room Where none could hear him call.	35.34852552315039
She took a penknife out of her pocket And cut off his little head.	22.418758179504625
And now he ’ ll play his ball no more For he lies among the dead.	55.372704459955685
How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?	17.89417415491516
With mixed feelings.	459.5233003948222
Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew ’ s daughter, all dressed in green.	105.05761351231678
Condense Stephen ’ s commentary.	419.5514366287634
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined.	192.7968536231874
Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny.	11.671061149751932
It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting.	17.21050928291976
It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.	86.70440700352958
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?	15.925507537601325
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.	36.39499385546467
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?	14.750981879815043
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.	173.27731206479655
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?	15.925507537601325
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.	42.9561645588997
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?	17.294658428825247
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds.	29.99307675221269
From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.	23.631598786711063
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?	33.15414783224064
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of <NUM> and <NUM> years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.	37.68161780390072
What other infantile memories had he of her?	71.22506286001963
<NUM> June <NUM>.	4971.564040184301
A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion.	21.703596747921985
A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.	11.680167329506856
What endemic characteristics were present?	124.85350697314365
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.	12.319692130121435
What memories had he of her adolescence?	115.20148111184486
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess.	105.86905170896893
On the duke ’ s lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated).	35.19489407949649
On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated).	22.83634415449424

Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?	18.383709198263595
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.	329.9116889493994
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly, if differently?	43.24723301717162
A temporary departure of his cat.	345.4647263764352
Why similarly, why differently?	186.81766869138673
Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.	94.00759177642499
In other respects were their differences similar?	63.71934222592187
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.	81.67132840568866
As?	523.7321325885175
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat).	52.51983720530529
Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen ’ s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat).	20.17885409572198
Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat).	9.65636835772227
Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.	35.211021925357336
In what way had he utilised gifts (<NUM>) an owl, <NUM>) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?	48.02579174888926
As object lessons to explain: <NUM>) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: <NUM>) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, <NUM> / <NUM> minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.	29.087677527415
In what manners did she reciprocate?	56.764974108110785
She remembered: on the <NUM> th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.	43.2521160424186
She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires.	21.121313509431292
She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.	64.16347684011039
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?	31.77563907238639
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.	31.85902547687982
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation?	31.029904850937164
For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction.	18.84870169335654
For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.	9.402585965770566
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew ’ s daughter?	30.775673463664226
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.	37.03867663397473
To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?	40.69247117708668
If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, <NUM> October <NUM>.	24.464150431741043
What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?	104.57475320109823
A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), <NUM> June <NUM>, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).	73.62831921209151
Was the proposal of asylum accepted?	53.24334275365321
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.	37.77498290504314
What exchange of money took place between host and guest?	44.5177124345527
The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£ <NUM> <NUM>), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to the former.	84.68395075220745
What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?	9.816896580430335
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed.	43.56237260320322
To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress.	47.0505879917941
To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, <NUM> Lower Abbey street (W.	20.226001871256695
and E.	163.22290151928087
Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, <NUM> Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit).	39.412536137888225
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?	26.81429085255423
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler ’ s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown ’ s) papa.	42.38557018186781
The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of <NUM> he (Bloom) had marked a florin (<NUM> / -) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J.	43.449210898569916
and T.	100.39477067177603
Davy, family grocers, <NUM> Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.	40.68707451294657
Was the clown Bloom ’ s son?	243.61444274499672
No. Had Bloom ’ s coin returned?	152.0365236463306
Never.	10424.983750507796
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?	43.429070330179464
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.	23.387764350924975
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?	18.144793339556397
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.	10.18108645176111
Why did he desist from speculation?	67.41239132690919
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.	58.388829926576435
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?	142.8813093935204
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?	80.56188084283983
Not verbally.	240.06036372529834
Substantially.	1218.4197832253003
What comforted his misapprehension?	182.73638471799973
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.	179.6628073274938
In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?	43.14375212118549
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by BLOOM Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by STEPHEN With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?	8.964062765671136
What did each do at the door of egress?	432.96911185256755
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor.	185.20774974908122
Stephen put the hat on his head.	259.32678653965684
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?	69.22919785293044
For a cat.	111.16341293023089
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?	111.5221157810875
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.	35.67277646960313
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?	13.95296719656147
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft <NUM> ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) <NUM> lightyears (<NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> miles) distant and in volume <NUM> times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which <NUM> of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in <NUM>: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	23.232101367568948
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?	11.268216091491187
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.	14.708461657480667
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?	46.387494556077115
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?	30.886887043170567
Of a different order of difficulty.	46.531400999478635
Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of <NUM> tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.	14.976426830764725
And the problem of possible redemption?	78.212849152909
The minor was proved by the major.	221.0836494892252
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?	165.34308763543177
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the <NUM> th: their positions: the waggoner ’ s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S.	9.616648188516034
Lawrence (martyr, <NUM> August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (<NUM> st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (<NUM> nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.	16.44678391757476
His (Bloom ’ s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?	34.076847168061995
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman.	18.794644683692404
That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence.	19.495917237460592
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?	406.2525690730498
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.	54.65793884827675
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?	10.273817090804656
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.	46.87488464426894
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?	142.00134295391592
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.	13.343013440916101
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom ’ s, who attracted Stephen ’ s, gaze?	118.59255720593534
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom ’ s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O ’ Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, <NUM> Aungier street.	24.697379211665666
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?	28.512069529854347
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.	12.945787960608508
Both then were silent?	37.626094917772754
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.	39.49287973880651
Were they indefinitely inactive?	239.9369240015005
At Stephen ’ s suggestion, at Bloom ’ s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom ’ s, then Stephen ’ s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.	59.93822931055799
Similarly?	1218.4197832253003
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom ’ s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School (<NUM>) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, <NUM> scholars: Stephen ’ s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.	55.38803678744383
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?	40.636399294108124
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.	18.714133850961602
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (<NUM> January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.	27.972482999643688
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?	47.361141999004715
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.	26.57926591982554
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?	31.47311203998943
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.	13.708044350858893
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?	62.51433218864568
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.	31.460501143778835
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?	30.850381543863662
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.	826.1399799064159
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?	70.1934491047364
By Stephen: Liliata rutilantium.	41.34799494549894
Turma circumdet.	170.76217170975505
Iubilantium te virginum.	69.04471320096071
By Bloom: Heigho, heigho, Heigho, heigho.	18.67753842570936
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?	100.43122737624813
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).	29.637824002865926
Alone, what did Bloom hear?	74.12510049823075
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew ’ s harp in the resonant lane.	216.10065382013417
Alone, what did Bloom feel?	74.12510049823075
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.	10.877510077165788
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?	12.507329907474242
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F.	10.398181032227262
Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).	17.919993904594048
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?	155.49651656840973
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk.	76.2246212509967
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?	31.16720528094763
Once, in <NUM>, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.	73.72933277757579
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?	98.81726963434315
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.	55.8790474436586
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door.	25.866851211922636
With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.	50.35510288320946
What suddenly arrested his ingress?	113.08277583191484
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.	24.7901229777206
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture.	132.82027843378532
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	28.511015251752642
Describe them.	203.07158957055697
One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.	16.75730042878703
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.	11.12463270736195
What significances attached to these two chairs?	66.02482514635113
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.	37.23414030131672
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?	125.3030181305053
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies ’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_ (words by G.	14.565748384532467

With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?	14.120440742977594
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan ’ s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.	10.521652717824619
His next proceeding?	395.7891199604412
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.	26.146752597137816
What followed this operation?	149.1855730868911
The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.	21.986902605563767
What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?	76.14481509136283
What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?	28.37984490644983
In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl.	76.69920638140746
Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.	9.67952475730948
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?	65.66667898597275
The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.	32.077637439322025
Why solitary (ipsorelative)?	133.05940695224822
Brothers and sisters had he none.	37.667748235938845
Yet that man ’ s father was his grandfather ’ s son.	93.82418433870318
Why mutable (aliorelative)?	133.05940695224822
From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.	47.150344364172604
From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator.	18.054622350603772
What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?	198.76248627111787
The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite.	42.295539274252306

Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the lacerated ungual fragment.	25.312480447717043

What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?	66.01941111171055
A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality, of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown.	14.171759979869359
Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.	16.97457451716481

What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?	23.156115800097346
Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?	117.45779624261002
Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.	29.3215710667515
As?	523.7321325885175
The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.	23.680649050731155
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?	52.67308712919707
Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.	23.929488268078092

Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged <NUM>) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).	12.74483985565661
Leopold Bloom (aged <NUM>) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.	41.0640659304475
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?	11.740323206939607
In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.	68.69706837709163
What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?	117.33207503346613
Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.	91.12936485057507
Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate.	11.800470678521764

What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?	38.262138902578414
The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.	26.819842717350934
What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?	51.69437512166926
The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.	325.5950358827174

Nadir of misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper.	17.13044898242015
With which attendant indignities?	200.54974957623824
The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing.	26.111799832029526
By what could such a situation be precluded?	34.31977258338747

What considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?	41.98345277616088

The necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.	20.1735150305735
What considerations rendered departure not irrational?	57.97470395993435
The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible.	13.732287280421325

Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall.	11.103004483309684
Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king.	15.832349513345148
What would render such return irrational?	62.140198167912764

Bloom ’ s acts?	312.8293969725228
He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.	24.813087235662703
How?	528.9017885059641
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.	27.14175128911848
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?	180.61846296893242
New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.	26.536046077870555
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?	46.85188644058231
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.	23.168452840010126
What preceding series?	472.103284569784
Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d ’ Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society ’ s Horse Show, Maggot O ’ Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E.	22.718268353578477
(Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to no last term.	156.4316200369896
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).	28.451032226018853
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?	45.13666005171605
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.	42.98727470858801
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?	11.784439632350916
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.	23.512155148116786
Envy?	812.0832237234374
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.	13.254406891076124
Jealousy?	1218.4197832253003
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction.	24.914784663998915
Because attraction between agent (s) and reagent (s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance.	20.03341623381605
Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.	33.59141510084069
Abnegation?	1218.4197832253003
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September <NUM> in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, <NUM> Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.	9.523121734092719
Equanimity?	1218.4197832253003
As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.	15.649468624193783
As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun.	65.61959797541566
As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king ’ s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder.	7.503340104091494
As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease.	7.6490807186298335
As more than inevitable, irreparable.	164.96634272240954
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?	32.58020417329921
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.	21.83929396194488
What retribution, if any?	326.4526227259485
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right.	37.29833966027625

Divorce, not now.	788.2736353856607
Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet.	23.380321580436938
Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly.	15.742233248882538
Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly.	32.24218854309747
If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both.	9.8916490901394
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?	19.81921436120491
The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.	16.87401526177113
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?	11.717397754916536
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.	17.81415284798032
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?	101.6014774082256
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.	23.751083598584405
Then?	10989.518309293822
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.	18.766442785398084
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?	101.6014774082256
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.	19.50913897179199
What followed this silent action?	86.07547564080026

Absolutely.	812.0832237234374

By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, <NUM> September <NUM>, there remained a period of <NUM> months and <NUM> day during which, in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.	22.200275453115484
How?	528.9017885059641

• Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out <NUM> d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water <NUM> woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters <NUM> per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come <NUM> or <NUM> times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out <NUM> kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ <NUM> for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die <NUM> times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered <NUM> teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea <NUM> days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give <NUM> points in <NUM> to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was <NUM> times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the <NUM> big poppies because mine was the <NUM> th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was <NUM> after <NUM> when I saw the <NUM> Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the <NUM> th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the <NUM> rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a <NUM> st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him <NUM> or <NUM> tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G <NUM> th Bn <NUM> nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the <NUM> acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the <NUM> th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <NUM> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <NUM> obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about <NUM> / - in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <NUM> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <NUM> years more I have of life up to <NUM> no Im what am I at all Ill be <NUM> in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street <NUM> st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she <NUM> there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a — e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page <NUM> the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made <NUM> the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was <NUM> of the <NUM> wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into <NUM> of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that <NUM> the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no <NUM> with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the <NUM> nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about <NUM> minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W C I ’ ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their <NUM> Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have

affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the <NUM> things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the <NUM> of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near <NUM> or a <NUM> her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because <NUM> drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing <NUM> times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in <NUM> years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly <NUM> years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about <NUM> perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure <NUM> carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that

damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were <NUM> of us goodbye to my sleep for this

wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those <NUM> lb pots of mixed plum and

and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats <NUM> consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news <NUM> years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <NUM> shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in <NUM> halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what <NUM> or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at <NUM> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her <NUM> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us <NUM> days every <NUM> or <NUM> weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced <NUM> times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about <NUM> weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself <NUM> and <NUM> times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about <NUM> minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very <NUM> st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after <NUM> years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our <NUM> sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait <NUM> quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their <NUM> pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and <NUM> children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying <NUM> / - in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats <NUM> years ago now yes hed be <NUM> though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the <NUM> th card after that the <NUM> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the <NUM> queens and the <NUM> of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and <NUM> red <NUM> s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait <NUM> I was married <NUM> Milly is <NUM> yesterday <NUM> what age was he then at Dillons <NUM> or <NUM> about <NUM> I suppose hes <NUM> or more Im not too old for him if hes <NUM> or <NUM> I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in <NUM> a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from <NUM> years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the <NUM> st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <NUM> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a <NUM> nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent <NUM> atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same <NUM> lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <NUM> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <NUM> s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our <NUM> st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <NUM> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for <NUM> he can make it for <NUM> Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only <NUM> or <NUM> Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the <NUM> st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him <NUM> or <NUM> times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue <NUM> miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ <NUM> or perhaps <NUM> / - Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent <NUM> or <NUM> questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day

couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes <NUM> years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas <NUM> glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.	25.415808939893466
