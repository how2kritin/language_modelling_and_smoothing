8963.499733162327
Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	14924.070454036077
A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air.	10110.626980447574
He held the bowl aloft and intoned: — _Introibo ad altare Dei_.	9550.006784752593
Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: — Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit! Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.	15716.522933112106
He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains.	10133.867856585017
Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head.	9302.906980079326
Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.	12571.644844744022
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.	11174.620925003706
— Back to barracks! he said sternly.	6895.411137516915
He added in a preacher ’ s tone: — For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns.	11993.308093828053
Slow music, please.	10092.520128356107
Shut your eyes, gents.	11071.243735077656
One moment.	3116.7207134604323
Silence, all.	8606.461048856854
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points.	12216.006624886784
Chrysostomos.	19456.598729469286
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.	12837.679772922485
That will do nicely.	5525.505656471212
Switch off the current, will you?	7858.525341597721
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown.	12486.389785267282
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.	11014.727054241943
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.	6046.919551803094
— The mockery of it! he said gaily.	4191.544831884582
Your absurd name, an ancient Greek! He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself.	11391.882513005801
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.	12511.626574968766
Buck Mulligan ’ s gay voice went on.	4456.662314910598
— My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.	8774.170759070686
But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn ’ t it?	5634.570888591717
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.	13073.547167562147
We must go to Athens.	9159.796561545205
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?	10965.041748034948
He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried: — Will he come?	10153.815745251697
The jejune jesuit! Ceasing, he began to shave with care.	8613.773228853102
— Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.	3930.7619336542
— Yes, my love?	2233.5283591313996
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.	8224.001948261448
— God, isn ’ t he dreadful?	4110.323705863798
he said frankly.	6462.870819478619
A ponderous Saxon.	5632.710288770732
He thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	4036.120649687769
God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion.	11684.051023159845
Because he comes from Oxford.	8829.323993934064
You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner.	8590.048344789726
He can ’ t make you out.	3470.3684112568817
O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife - blade.	9065.317572524395
He shaved warily over his chin.	6774.4711874201885
— He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.	3607.864691098678
Where is his guncase?	6931.0776193030915
— A woful lunatic! Mulligan said.	2573.1192908236717
Were you in a funk?	10737.313695406954
— I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.	3791.013390527377
Out here in the dark with a man I don ’ t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther.	8366.887941232872
I ’ m not a hero, however.	2336.51164971903
If he stays on here I am off.	7671.721502114667
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.	8381.411938054805
He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.	9697.263016768582
— Scutter! he cried thickly.	6736.085832742562
He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen ’ s upper pocket, said: — Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.	10105.89297549998
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief.	12576.548637102782
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.	7550.251292103888
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said: — The bard ’ s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.	9572.992470134253
You can almost taste it, can ’ t you?	3987.3940427781204
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.	11779.010278043743
— God! he said quietly.	3026.2944931348247
Isn ’ t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother?	10425.707053935474
The snotgreen sea.	3400.8249447685603
_Epi oinopa ponton_.	18227.659305286496
Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you.	7848.421137544201
You must read them in the original.	6195.240107850541
_Thalatta! Thalatta! _ She is our great sweet mother.	12876.485377734092
Come and look.	6332.211814934417
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.	5855.23917164837
Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.	12431.57279015977
— Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.	2401.1823254702294
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen ’ s face.	4986.73495007952
— The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.	2327.9928878561677
That ’ s why she won ’ t let me have anything to do with you.	3777.8177391977333
— Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.	5625.286922810243
— You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said.	5864.472260189028
I ’ m hyperborean as much as you.	2323.1199812855066
But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her.	8641.279790465449
And you refused.	4682.872386062472
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.	8477.820507324832
A tolerant smile curled his lips.	5203.908684212336
— But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself.	6300.671575104989
Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all! He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.	13838.436020847763
Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat - sleeve.	12635.866921100771
Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.	11052.692274077292
Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	12073.757933357847
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.	10796.482727740871
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.	11413.485513858946
A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.	13846.147836759612
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.	6822.551185873277
— Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice.	4742.499891373834
I must give you a shirt and a few noserags.	8201.70350692802
How are the secondhand breeks?	7605.483841612115
— They fit well enough, Stephen answered.	4217.049098924436
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.	9196.633523051956
— The mockery of it, he said contentedly.	3101.9210361336295
Secondleg they should be.	11241.543348946274
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey.	6996.264100699844
You ’ ll look spiffing in them.	3845.598806578705
I ’ m not joking, Kinch.	2209.5867914288265
You look damn well when you ’ re dressed.	7322.150381543679
— Thanks, Stephen said.	912.5968356552173
I can ’ t wear them if they are grey.	4814.42190185174
— He can ’ t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.	4771.1648821463
Etiquette is etiquette.	16807.8688531982
He kills his mother but he can ’ t wear grey trousers.	7130.671765507516
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes.	9076.006664626706
— That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g.	8647.593974962254
p.	6161.756177770574
i.	19456.598729469286
He ’ s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.	4433.552426088586
General paralysis of the insane! He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.	12429.21127273286
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.	10881.263819731083
Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.	15447.834462893416
— Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack.	8832.069190664011
Hair on end.	10013.183901689963
As he and others see me.	4890.673859877833
Who chose this face for me?	7449.107270253675
This dogsbody to rid of vermin.	11417.590710112916
It asks me too.	4240.67100909093
— I pinched it out of the skivvy ’ s room, Buck Mulligan said.	2932.2163290205103
It does her all right.	3911.4073564719347
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.	8309.94968894011
Lead him not into temptation.	17725.40949905442
And her name is Ursula.	6892.125942424123
Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen ’ s peering eyes.	9064.249136167882
— The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.	4109.2321382938435
If Wilde were only alive to see you! Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness: — It is a symbol of Irish art.	9878.66626139441
The cracked lookingglass of a servant.	5601.478909835448
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen ’ s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.	9420.343096530845
— It ’ s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?	3333.523051241489
he said kindly.	5067.323171296723
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.	8184.477332466986
Parried again.	8198.124297545315
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.	9092.710120631238
The cold steel pen.	5254.3537811088945
— Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea.	10282.307067926231
He ’ s stinking with money and thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	4378.089433265227
His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.	11919.026883372264
God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island.	10956.727902054545
Hellenise it.	5751.538303898366
Cranly ’ s arm.	7314.021583710438
His arm.	3427.489002933945
— And to think of your having to beg from these swine.	6843.631088226802
I ’ m the only one that knows what you are.	3691.824091932887
Why don ’ t you trust me more?	4653.279069667498
What have you up your nose against me?	6762.00444947491
Is it Haines?	7209.290449120756
If he makes any noise here I ’ ll bring down Seymour and we ’ ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.	9905.744779403289
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe ’ s rooms.	14169.661646097136
Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.	14334.886403367955
O, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor ’ s shears.	13237.54979149072
A scared calf ’ s face gilded with marmalade.	8203.185351040018
I don ’ t want to be debagged! Don ’ t you play the giddy ox with me! Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.	6570.635872372543
A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold ’ s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.	11754.51379929108
To ourselves...	1688.1443178156649
new paganism...	3176.46297319129
omphalos.	19456.598729469286
— Let him stay, Stephen said.	1648.732651954708
There ’ s nothing wrong with him except at night.	5345.68541482944
— Then what is it?	1942.966484504928
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.	4991.455427207311
Cough it up.	5183.39568140556
I ’ m quite frank with you.	2054.6318414748407
What have you against me now?	5588.225879464083
They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.	12031.050587857466
Stephen freed his arm quietly.	8278.317575755796
— Do you wish me to tell you?	3348.5250689115446
he asked.	1146.2406223222367
— Yes, what is it?	1049.4142376975
I don ’ t remember anything.	1642.8201883984343
He looked in Stephen ’ s face as he spoke.	4039.0587747017007
A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.	9887.008939349047
Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said: — Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother ’ s death?	8967.459759037809
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: — What?	3644.9938112198824
Where?	1599.242359848175
I can ’ t remember anything.	2336.811118255249
I remember only ideas and sensations.	7163.078939362582
Why?	1336.6418951783915
What happened in the name of God?	6152.211167985873
— You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water.	5992.561232013266
She asked you who was in your room.	8256.068912099718
— Yes?	978.2723092978424
Buck Mulligan said.	649.4398393441165
What did I say?	3569.7647983815978
I forget.	3335.6290073774394
— You said, Stephen answered, _O, it ’ s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly <URL> A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan ’ s cheek.	8529.755946744137
— Did I say that?	2924.5961679402058
he asked.	1146.2406223222367
Well?	3294.9718417722875
What harm is that?	2877.2627621486267
He shook his constraint from him nervously.	8281.163261016192
— And what is death, he asked, your mother ’ s or yours or my own?	7365.029181737597
You saw only your mother die.	8112.22215246359
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.	10579.611193620007
It ’ s a beastly thing and nothing else.	3533.7802835958587
It simply doesn ’ t matter.	5970.048328094454
You wouldn ’ t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.	8114.51807946392
Why?	1336.6418951783915
To me it ’ s all a mockery and beastly.	6858.620480498216
Her cerebral lobes are not functioning.	11173.259894902454
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt.	12073.053867024337
Humour her till it ’ s over.	7015.87318662967
You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don ’ t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette ’ s.	8730.200650626599
Absurd! I suppose I did say it.	9062.292355014131
I didn ’ t mean to offend the memory of your mother.	4708.234450692738
He had spoken himself into boldness.	6121.009326841871
Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly: — I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.	10509.404912821034
— Of what then?	3248.5058819513815
Buck Mulligan asked.	1914.0404406900502
— Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.	4080.6140206211235
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.	8240.93072251788
— O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.	4810.098869530496
He walked off quickly round the parapet.	5808.6522560051
Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.	12218.512770520532
Sea and headland now grew dim.	15669.322221546165
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.	12379.703427759248
A voice within the tower called loudly: — Are you up there, Mulligan?	10246.704714103482
— I ’ m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.	1716.8381164870596
He turned towards Stephen and said: — Look at the sea.	3872.3941495187773
What does it care about offences?	8167.100505308178
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.	8254.458994756533
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof: — Don ’ t mope over it all day, he said.	6174.29742674245
I ’ m inconsequent.	1739.5214336373215
Give up the moody brooding.	12043.116601069158
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead: And no more turn aside and brood Upon love ’ s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars.	11071.241780318656
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed.	16623.620096300005
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.	15027.347976972014
White breast of the dim sea.	10529.332422280542
The twining stresses, two by two.	6327.464564926757
A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords.	9631.0314889225
Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.	17389.217683205246
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green.	9468.817295202509
It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.	8880.48185923333
Fergus ’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.	12975.429456373156
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.	10483.619169204674
Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside.	14998.498005723866
She was crying in her wretched bed.	6214.741014402463
For those words, Stephen: love ’ s bitter mystery.	10091.584530449423
Where now?	4105.09120374178
Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.	13971.616994986409
She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang: I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility.	12762.506997835068
Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.	17451.79981929239
And no more turn aside and brood.	5762.881049734355
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys.	14202.061750699457
Memories beset his brooding brain.	14820.693222644375
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament.	12379.948711093466
A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.	12385.558944657956
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children ’ s shirts.	12249.302698096351
In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	9950.60605973139
Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.	10660.836795217574
On me alone.	6177.202119370023
The ghostcandle to light her agony.	7846.611198558572
Ghostly light on the tortured face.	11007.621256273376
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees.	11759.642203146064
Her eyes on me to strike me down.	7954.851018104491
_Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus <URL> Ghoul! Chewer of corpses! No, mother! Let me be and let me live.	14796.621300795841
— Kinch ahoy! Buck Mulligan ’ s voice sang from within the tower.	6341.497911814259
It came nearer up the staircase, calling again.	7104.379150729694
Stephen, still trembling at his soul ’ s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.	9666.037181080157
— Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.	7529.155048060608
Breakfast is ready.	12738.522072347934
Haines is apologising for waking us last night.	9014.47387683615
It ’ s all right.	788.0222751231742
— I ’ m coming, Stephen said, turning.	1487.9680201931624
— Do, for Jesus ’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.	2868.6248436500587
For my sake and for all our sakes.	10037.58125068848
His head disappeared and reappeared.	7959.90870882896
— I told him your symbol of Irish art.	4424.804232413991
He says it ’ s very clever.	5377.797003525357
Touch him for a quid, will you?	5856.602777412375
A guinea, I mean.	4012.260834291842
— I get paid this morning, Stephen said.	1863.742980703381
— The school kip?	3266.2775074436468
Buck Mulligan said.	649.4398393441165
How much?	3515.1212080258233
Four quid?	10785.100552109981
Lend us one.	8980.292966670422
— If you want it, Stephen said.	1622.6265075318017
— Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight.	5749.917889264048
We ’ ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.	8994.537819092036
Four omnipotent sovereigns.	11746.363049533215
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent: O, won ’ t we have a merry time, Drinking whisky, beer and wine! On coronation, Coronation day! O, won ’ t we have a merry time On coronation day! Warm sunshine merrying over the sea.	9409.523095845072
The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet.	6975.319146836247
Why should I bring it down?	9855.736185556167
Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?	11639.401300384483
He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.	10793.482607701955
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.	10870.355738164395
I am another now and yet the same.	4852.879450281773
A server of a servant.	5754.441484567911
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan ’ s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow.	10738.852310310156
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.	13521.685288883466
— We ’ ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.	1682.9317128399173
Haines, open that door, will you?	6160.105960480273
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.	8522.518074990192
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.	10638.63022897647
— Have you the key?	3311.4165394050733
a voice asked.	7129.6994385293165
— Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.	2088.5565666929674
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.	11730.360341791595
Haines stood at the doorway, looking out.	7549.642511130056
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait.	7947.511654760172
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him.	5962.121972631586
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.	9470.94613997538
— I ’ m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...	1775.7831235099545
But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.	11844.205081911727
Haines, come in.	5485.619343540445
The grub is ready.	4858.516612304067
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.	15724.13672809459
Where ’ s the sugar?	3254.3723377005645
O, jay, there ’ s no milk.	4174.01844372756
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker.	11651.000463332875
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.	7827.754361468947
— What sort of a kip is this?	4147.455738026902
I told her to come after eight.	5829.486316655598
— We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.	5371.925800536748
There ’ s a lemon in the locker.	3593.796655930815
— O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said.	3160.6856049282983
I want Sandycove milk.	3843.453747641095
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly: — That woman is coming up with the milk.	11009.3447436272
— The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair.	7782.871881464543
Sit down.	5453.528265626985
Pour out the tea there.	9916.860098333904
The sugar is in the bag.	6183.519475322115
Here, I can ’ t go fumbling at the damned eggs.	7620.565868578684
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying: — _In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus <URL> Haines sat down to pour out the tea.	11312.774718575072
— I ’ m giving you two lumps each, he said.	1749.1998971472865
But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don ’ t you?	4288.574819377403
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman ’ s wheedling voice: — When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.	9862.450221276471
And when I makes water I makes water.	6037.774642051972
— By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.	3565.217120428824
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: — _So I do, Mrs Cahill, _ says she.	9731.75277147585
_Begob, ma ’ am, _ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don ’ t make them in the one <URL> He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.	10749.287542045962
— That ’ s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines.	4511.151169923705
Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum.	15321.886766047886
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.	11981.231355483316
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows: — Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan ’ s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?	10905.987605173425
— I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.	4833.336066341403
— Do you now?	1781.6845380824725
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.	4176.058063818341
Your reasons, pray?	11486.142895062863
— I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion.	6451.691277598568
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.	15390.31800328498
Buck Mulligan ’ s face smiled with delight.	4014.553650772184
— Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly.	10330.442365548975
Do you think she was?	5253.225686212799
Quite charming! Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: _ — For old Mary Ann She doesn ’ t care a damn.	13522.250521238819
But, hising up her petticoats... _ He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.	8593.936809644858
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.	8074.903788362939
— The milk, sir! — Come in, ma ’ am, Mulligan said.	4259.386480854419
Kinch, get the jug.	15152.651723071023
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen ’ s elbow.	8510.298546348264
— That ’ s a lovely morning, sir, she said.	1263.1939157130319
Glory be to God.	7854.920926107794
— To whom?	3199.159273400243
Mulligan said, glancing at her.	6353.352537289233
Ah, to be sure! Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.	9316.988264991738
— How much, sir?	2111.099549212126
asked the old woman.	7299.961666092202
— A quart, Stephen said.	1185.1861719814613
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers.	11214.71898893455
Old shrunken paps.	10227.348794111555
She poured again a measureful and a tilly.	10029.066528062038
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger.	14229.156632223167
She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.	8405.36261950302
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.	16861.68725749965
They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.	10507.329283224472
Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times.	13223.403943839487
A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.	12738.679858792437
To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.	12812.90938213403
— It is indeed, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.	5687.781402692958
— Taste it, sir, she said.	1902.304101409417
He drank at her bidding.	6156.98110350233
— If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn ’ t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.	8399.388524325812
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives ’ spits.	16227.005271595543
— Are you a medical student, sir?	3247.9525319314967
the old woman asked.	5051.490605886036
— I am, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan answered.	2798.892978745105
— Look at that now, she said.	2216.5256472011174
Stephen listened in scornful silence.	7944.584255308567
She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights.	13694.670866250464
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.	9700.304350171968
— Do you understand what he says?	4477.264527451477
Stephen asked her.	2660.7495809661514
— Is it French you are talking, sir?	4103.859242156031
the old woman said to Haines.	7692.4055629176055
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.	13085.11216428012
— Irish, Buck Mulligan said.	1502.1697445048874
Is there Gaelic on you?	5987.02211454735
— I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.	2952.206106579983
Are you from the west, sir?	5462.21949470798
— I am an Englishman, Haines answered.	3570.9085928052627
— He ’ s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.	4319.164963150565
I ’ m told it ’ s a grand language by them that knows.	3973.691506978962
— Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.	8188.601878904398
Wonderful entirely.	13208.696921829242
Fill us out some more tea, Kinch.	12802.759604644385
Would you like a cup, ma ’ am?	7406.0154471830765
— No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.	6461.107849679967
Haines said to her: — Have you your bill?	9886.090523043536
We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn ’ t we?	7610.911656452505
Stephen filled again the three cups.	9494.709971570837
— Bill, sir?	2525.970263668324
she said, halting.	11638.94946660578
Well, it ’ s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling.	11375.0930909165
That ’ s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.	3881.2977658533955
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.	10780.012136026187
— Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.	6307.93689571187
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk.	12359.261465711512
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried: — A miracle! He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying: — Ask nothing more of me, sweet.	10647.775057184253
All I can give you I give.	8962.37807335223
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.	7982.582105463681
— We ’ ll owe twopence, he said.	1556.7632962957114
— Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.	4814.920783014934
Time enough.	4952.875065457369
Good morning, sir.	1923.1509087784061
She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan ’ s tender chant: _ — Heart of my heart, were it more, More would be laid at your <URL> He turned to Stephen and said: — Seriously, Dedalus.	10244.960519449816
I ’ m stony.	1739.5214336373215
Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money.	13349.944986037546
Today the bards must drink and junket.	14404.675971082808
Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.	13618.074684958981
— That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.	6085.82444317739
— Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.	2174.310647886296
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: — Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?	8809.779642012298
Then he said to Haines: — The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.	8797.268706638984
— All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.	8988.850574580436
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke: — I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.	11749.573106520998
Speaking to me.	4256.085536502762
They wash and tub and scrub.	9882.066823831887
Agenbite of inwit.	8037.658588071715
Conscience.	19456.598729469286
Yet here ’ s a spot.	6001.765986405164
— That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.	8089.033087126265
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen ’ s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone: — Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.	9360.26484776014
— Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.	4040.2552722999812
I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.	6089.625935450917
— Would I make any money by it?	5571.9756577860635
Stephen asked.	1428.5347086661152
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said: — I don ’ t know, I ’ m sure.	5761.44513055611
He strolled out to the doorway.	4353.2783525025925
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour: — You put your hoof in it now.	8045.2661834061955
— Well?	1381.3923496808952
Stephen said.	707.0646941246576
The problem is to get money.	5993.112814273688
From whom?	6958.651763431728
From the milkwoman or from him.	4563.666703743034
It ’ s a toss up, I think.	2230.226248690136
— I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.	7701.805799758456
— I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.	3618.2568591247596
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen ’ s arm.	5934.52423445067
— From me, Kinch, he said.	1872.1916898156924
In a suddenly changed tone he added: — To tell you the God ’ s truth I think you ’ re right.	7336.445545925035
Damn all else they are good for.	11722.09616992397
Why don ’ t you play them as I do?	4787.023890268168
To hell with them all.	4007.754009293109
Let us get out of the kip.	6267.912801522893
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly: — Mulligan is stripped of his garments.	10924.944810120967
He emptied his pockets on to the table.	4171.150205180606
— There ’ s your snotrag, he said.	1071.1446069035587
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.	12243.896633455899
God, we ’ ll simply have to dress the character.	7708.177965075207
I want puce gloves and green boots.	5711.794054029277
Contradiction.	19456.598729469286
Do I contradict myself?	9679.49269468561
Very well then, I contradict myself.	11045.815681855342
Mercurial Malachi.	14855.367604579003
A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.	7156.22380118885
— And there ’ s your Latin quarter hat, he said.	1948.1340594527649
Stephen picked it up and put it on.	5488.339404927576
Haines called to them from the doorway: — Are you coming, you fellows?	11305.205786424878
— I ’ m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.	3062.2176974415934
Come out, Kinch.	6127.661605419089
You have eaten all we left, I suppose.	4982.20378947342
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow: — And going forth he met Butterly.	14887.446007807192
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it.	10073.798196412883
He put the huge key in his inner pocket.	6591.400445992879
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked: — Did you bring the key?	8227.705996125129
— I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.	2003.2751797765434
He walked on.	1324.0143685686166
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.	15717.165126044796
— Down, sir! How dare you, sir! Haines asked: — Do you pay rent for this tower?	8470.471488391075
— Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.	1960.790341572813
— To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.	7066.851195360043
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last: — Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.	10878.75930667811
Martello you call it?	7413.227674637286
— Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea.	5768.869424417393
But ours is the _omphalos_.	8651.154578586104
— What is your idea of Hamlet?	3906.7588091110215
Haines asked Stephen.	6033.641549226997
— No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.	3438.154997700792
I ’ m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up.	6071.675704884683
Wait till I have a few pints in me first.	6932.470113827533
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat: — You couldn ’ t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?	8417.235329964846
— It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.	7590.443007265782
— You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.	5956.96324470372
Is it some paradox?	7737.580471734529
— Pooh! Buck Mulligan said.	1700.5918043589631
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.	9985.595628708092
It ’ s quite simple.	2661.358243201816
He proves by algebra that Hamlet ’ s grandson is Shakespeare ’ s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.	8405.284537807656
— What?	425.82801927876443
Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen.	8008.51408687232
He himself?	2850.0232020680505
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen ’ s ear: — O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father! — We ’ re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines.	8963.662684165123
And it is rather long to tell.	6797.249086419063
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.	5980.639855533037
— The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.	3513.5637744105197
— I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore.	9946.99882254632
_That beetles o ’ er his base into the sea, _ isn ’ t it?	7696.060949522778
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak.	9475.94582538287
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.	11509.47653625848
— It ’ s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.	3920.8280683667017
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.	15035.938664475156
The seas ’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.	13264.506059583247
— I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.	5953.764272359056
The Father and the Son idea.	6761.481917350834
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.	9630.258475689528
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.	8319.04091335429
He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.	9803.057850027679
He moved a doll ’ s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: _ — I ’ m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.	8975.676717914985
My mother ’ s a jew, my father ’ s a bird.	4770.061342521268
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.	11076.11433636871
So here ’ s to disciples and <URL> He held up a forefinger of warning.	10970.40052253517
_ — If anyone thinks that I amn ’ t divine He ’ ll get no free drinks when I ’ m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water <URL> He tugged swiftly at Stephen ’ s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: _ — Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.	12258.934161617914
What ’ s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet ’ s breezy...	5454.162745869196
Goodbye, now, goodbye! _ He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury ’ s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.	14201.164018219764
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said: — We oughtn ’ t to laugh, I suppose.	9013.265402924144
He ’ s rather blasphemous.	2368.0994843209587
I ’ m not a believer myself, that is to say.	2585.356289105877
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn ’ t it?	6524.200504554977
What did he call it?	2984.862265254219
Joseph the Joiner?	15868.387090363325
— The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.	4233.426543946647
— O, Haines said, you have heard it before?	4191.151685715391
— Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.	6237.064727610881
— You ’ re not a believer, are you?	2602.065562972573
Haines asked.	3435.9297991056746
I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word.	5246.989271665934
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.	11901.79611229765
— There ’ s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.	2947.0452358744246
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone.	13549.192185655684
— Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.	3050.231505188765
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to.	9614.03289048207
He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.	10925.252172596425
— Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.	1900.2686879838825
Either you believe or you don ’ t, isn ’ t it?	4772.400651576788
Personally I couldn ’ t stomach that idea of a personal God.	9613.307610670694
You don ’ t stand for that, I suppose?	4516.5841509987
— You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.	7221.365931687856
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side.	8382.298021310087
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.	14353.585856799964
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path.	12128.478051078702
They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.	7601.113997814219
He wants that key.	4880.828217757997
It is mine.	2575.5429934135122
I paid the rent.	5121.016730909717
Now I eat his salt bread.	9652.442927573737
Give him the key too.	5664.362835901069
All.	3651.6613392020126
He will ask for it.	2871.090185774487
That was in his eyes.	2086.513073433603
— After all, Haines began...	2185.61219856387
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.	12922.149657607191
— After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.	7318.027674150064
You are your own master, it seems to me.	4429.9606732200145
— I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.	5521.786700270884
— Italian?	2546.31996829899
Haines said.	1723.4559011190609
A crazy queen, old and jealous.	9508.495077576094
Kneel down before me.	8861.014010779589
— And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	6137.209577177476
— Italian?	2546.31996829899
Haines said again.	4406.422272128835
What do you mean?	2802.0460027194717
— The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.	7645.763405951275
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.	12734.817756703002
— I can quite understand that, he said calmly.	3633.6639399830874
An Irishman must think like that, I daresay.	9712.489387686792
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly.	11198.899533068246
It seems history is to blame.	6212.727457409056
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen ’ s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam: _ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars.	12841.5257154477
Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.	15884.46459292616
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ ’ s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.	13430.628639588636
Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.	15263.531967677212
Idle mockery.	16878.573427268955
The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael ’ s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.	13241.79598809903
Hear, hear! Prolonged applause.	13658.876593894247
_Zut! Nom de Dieu! _ — Of course I ’ m a Britisher, Haines ’ s voice said, and I feel as one.	8919.114709298818
I don ’ t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.	4954.3351398786
That ’ s our national problem, I ’ m afraid, just now.	3585.8167317240705
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.	12557.417596793512
— She ’ s making for Bullock harbour.	5195.582498825174
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.	10525.943575863816
— There ’ s five fathoms out there, he said.	1728.5479005194675
It ’ ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one.	7157.88335136162
It ’ s nine days today.	2901.7919707361943
The man that was drowned.	3689.963577890829
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite.	12638.581111772131
Here I am.	5142.835625521221
They followed the winding path down to the creek.	9158.42286897107
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.	8377.780879841222
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.	11035.343912857621
— Is the brother with you, Malachi?	5431.920704941142
— Down in Westmeath.	5182.7258716035685
With the Bannons.	8041.058994149935
— Still there?	2746.930843923453
I got a card from Bannon.	7597.00917357842
Says he found a sweet young thing down there.	10145.751193583745
Photo girl he calls her.	8680.534052791278
— Snapshot, eh?	2636.7111123659765
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots.	6075.437331195355
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face.	10651.418583552306
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.	11993.42895575866
Chucked medicine and going in for the army.	14524.414831809225
— Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.	2622.4212078830046
— Going over next week to stew.	7628.638816835518
You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?	8438.547659828457
— Yes.	427.3278064178512
— Spooning with him last night on the pier.	8171.349952558027
The father is rotto with money.	5990.917052770766
— Is she up the pole?	5598.472431544869
— Better ask Seymour that.	3284.018704444759
— Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.	3161.9299614240454
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely: — Redheaded women buck like goats.	12206.733574833443
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.	9515.399917500972
— My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.	5335.477670021034
I ’ m the <URL> Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.	5393.97510551296
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.	9474.06794300177
— Are you going in here, Malachi?	4777.17823486984
— Yes.	427.3278064178512
Make room in the bed.	6041.357988138593
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.	9487.22523226769
Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.	10441.186590752435
— Are you not coming in?	3444.62679612417
Buck Mulligan asked.	1914.0404406900502
— Later on, Haines said.	2777.868408408295
Not on my breakfast.	7490.128179115016
Stephen turned away.	3961.6199422334503
— I ’ m going, Mulligan, he said.	978.0909078479319
Stephen handed him the key.	7373.495884830523
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.	8239.876382105022
— And twopence, he said, for a pint.	2962.323795852812
Throw it there.	7630.13918654243
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.	11389.896731602457
Dressing, undressing.	16807.8688531982
Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly: — He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord.	10485.29438894117
Thus spake Zarathustra.	15175.67984183378
His plump body plunged.	7910.126630096007
— We ’ ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.	7511.245469783544
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.	14058.897965116714
Half twelve.	9268.873942482349
— Good, Stephen said.	817.5616083107584
He walked along the upwardcurving path.	4805.803591719379
Liliata rutilantium.	15251.743453771543
Turma circumdet.	12452.996386040257
Iubilantium te virginum.	9654.052904688688
The priest ’ s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly.	8797.45730012192
I will not sleep here tonight.	4772.5529116640255
Home also I cannot go.	12322.267846940744
Turning the curve he waved his hand.	8598.844872813022
It called again.	3688.9949884396433
A sleek brown head, a seal ’ s, far out on the water, round.	8615.188047959904
Usurper.	19456.598729469286
— You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?	5761.219325139158
— Tarentum, sir.	1699.495143877583
— Very good.	2305.7142280366975
Well?	3294.9718417722875
— There was a battle, sir.	1894.748694451423
— Very good.	2305.7142280366975
Where?	1599.242359848175
The boy ’ s blank face asked the blank window.	7015.780088540486
Fabled by the daughters of memory.	11329.652466008336
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it.	7609.008328813149
A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake ’ s wings of excess.	11217.372110648095
I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame.	9527.951506735048
What ’ s left us then?	3501.9539979948563
— I forget the place, sir.	2264.171266381601
<NUM> B.	5352.924254163323
C.	957.8630399978279
— Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book.	6433.428607119937
— Yes, sir.	348.821558736703
And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done <URL> That phrase the world had remembered.	9595.382974455948
A dull ease of the mind.	5952.976366959219
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear.	13626.127792059275
Any general to any officers.	14084.990426654724
They lend ear.	5161.524672421782
— You, Armstrong, Stephen said.	1337.0559971141863
What was the end of Pyrrhus?	4826.962403349723
— End of Pyrrhus, sir?	3840.384402348717
— I know, sir.	752.4280060614216
Ask me, sir, Comyn said.	4976.9636923996395
— Wait.	1460.0048053775113
You, Armstrong.	6208.865768618624
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?	5715.488498414846
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong ’ s satchel.	10563.74856984306
He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly.	10296.978817221412
Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips.	10905.596127214621
A sweetened boy ’ s breath.	5509.138226395124
Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy.	12837.97798139487
Vico Road, Dalkey.	17932.61452774436
— Pyrrhus, sir?	2360.947116070501
Pyrrhus, a pier.	13074.097441263299
All laughed.	4259.946802067893
Mirthless high malicious laughter.	14932.863957684987
Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile.	16126.501608552953
In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.	11086.760893894805
— Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy ’ s shoulder with the book, what is a pier.	6755.350204584122
— A pier, sir, Armstrong said.	2811.8154697962887
A thing out in the water.	4296.785898190394
A kind of a bridge.	4389.74012051129
Kingstown pier, sir.	4576.694015650123
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning.	13308.67555877948
Two in the back bench whispered.	9411.94273283884
Yes.	804.865728120872
They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.	11730.40362506657
All.	3651.6613392020126
With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily.	12961.13270647285
Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle.	15043.697186714262
— Kingstown pier, Stephen said.	1566.6923659621675
Yes, a disappointed bridge.	4424.03358364634
The words troubled their gaze.	6282.789129711829
— How, sir?	1681.495098152762
Comyn asked.	7603.525442817579
A bridge is across a river.	8136.173944876501
For Haines ’ s chapbook.	9983.55437457658
No - one here to hear.	3986.499310972563
Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind.	14106.088782026758
What then?	3467.8933271351443
A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master ’ s praise.	11698.668639805976
Why had they chosen all that part?	10576.476841325628
Not wholly for the smooth caress.	11028.952681089562
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.	13808.43081883767
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam ’ s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death.	12375.143161488008
They are not to be thought away.	4420.371939294752
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted.	13971.817581978481
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were?	11662.741867891746
Or was that only possible which came to pass?	11034.167519424163
Weave, weaver of the wind.	12314.242446156655
— Tell us a story, sir.	2716.9485569264943
— O, do, sir.	1160.4432953214387
A ghoststory.	4762.787687825449
— Where do you begin in this?	4982.027421117565
Stephen asked, opening another book.	6404.975049279605
— _Weep no more, _ Comyn said.	4412.864545054012
— And the story, sir?	2118.557024428024
— After, Stephen said.	972.6576947716687
Go on, Talbot.	9415.862565605605
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel.	11655.821423520089
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text: _ — Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor... _ It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.	11307.794619832906
Aristotle ’ s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night.	13451.610598387268
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy.	12684.9762833165
Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind ’ s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.	16344.479055685479
Thought is the thought of thought.	12455.201257317653
Tranquil brightness.	16878.573427268955
The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms.	8459.817448570046
Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.	13113.125322219752
Talbot repeated: _ — Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves, Through the dear might... _ — Turn over, Stephen said quietly.	8874.04477636272
I don ’ t see anything.	1528.955145900798
— What, sir?	1235.791646642697
Talbot asked simply, bending forward.	13177.074004527098
His hand turned the page over.	5998.148910638311
He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered.	8617.392923927873
Of him that walked the waves.	8272.658771169403
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer ’ s heart and lips and on mine.	11622.763509535598
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute.	12427.217380243806
To Caesar what is Caesar ’ s, to God what is God ’ s.	6288.817941990604
A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church ’ s looms.	12916.241369531119
Ay. Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.	13568.724603597588
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.	14190.822493355065
— Have I heard all?	4860.7581787665
Stephen asked.	1428.5347086661152
— Yes, sir.	348.821558736703
Hockey at ten, sir.	5826.0312944507605
— Half day, sir.	1718.7124880669178
Thursday.	9940.351240891207
— Who can answer a riddle?	5362.393056899478
Stephen asked.	1428.5347086661152
They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.	11674.249122686271
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily: — A riddle, sir?	12173.552032864438
— O, ask me, sir.	1559.1006786389396
— A hard one, sir.	2158.573689785261
— This is the riddle, Stephen said: The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven.	8857.714821848927
’ Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven.	10484.203786257194
What is that?	1074.469658533115
— What, sir?	1235.791646642697
We didn ’ t hear.	3210.5809626279292
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated.	12810.42956384555
After a silence Cochrane said: — What is it, sir?	4786.212848461613
We give it up.	3267.25659015387
Stephen, his throat itching, answered: — The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.	10260.09551840969
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay.	8761.192933404493
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called: — Hockey! They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.	10592.124170577483
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues.	15104.118241770138
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook.	15448.14300743551
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.	13519.412643526697
On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail ’ s bed.	11778.970673055213
He held out his copybook.	5097.615983608846
The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.	8761.713014224226
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot.	13779.50038196233
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.	16685.36900253381
— Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir.	4844.967319801647
Stephen touched the edges of the book.	8069.93820731687
Futility.	19456.598729469286
— Do you understand how to do them now?	4605.648457652712
he asked.	1146.2406223222367
— Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered.	6409.086397945859
— Can you do them yourself?	4826.67903825813
Stephen asked.	1428.5347086661152
— No, sir.	598.6761090025806
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail ’ s bed.	13260.521967378676
Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.	11022.72238674795
She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own.	8189.949395676535
Was that then real?	10105.728242595162
The only true thing in life?	6181.044269893843
His mother ’ s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode.	10937.386137186064
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes.	10968.157977144781
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.	11045.887454460779
A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.	12456.913435781706
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.	14155.891193597556
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare ’ s ghost is Hamlet ’ s grandfather.	8411.473478281958
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses.	14515.9149893232
Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.	14981.757290542826
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.	14003.155932149373
Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.	14431.755106842273
Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.	13461.438112707958
— Do you understand now?	2350.652468654383
Can you work the second for yourself?	9320.691959093252
— Yes, sir.	348.821558736703
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data.	10725.923819647183
Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin.	14739.422553949664
_Amor matris: _ subjective and objective genitive.	15395.53048125475
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.	14295.007920044276
My childhood bends beside me.	5807.091657152105
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly.	12542.317606035498
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes.	11717.906643269098
Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.	14542.50867877472
The sum was done.	4607.510977499623
— It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.	3379.3503840544417
— Yes, sir.	348.821558736703
Thanks, Sargent answered.	6520.787055127177
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench.	11240.943675039289
— You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’ s graceless form.	7555.053742625532
— Yes, sir.	348.821558736703
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.	9041.022783036047
— Sargent! — Run on, Stephen said.	3091.4198769603618
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife.	11048.90458399602
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.	11297.70567201028
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him.	7633.911649141415
He turned his angry white moustache.	4761.094690445784
he cried continually without listening.	9501.526341044544
— Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.	3555.767530713313
— Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here.	5961.993008411144
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man ’ s voice cried sternly: — What is the matter?	7990.778541499683
What is it now?	2525.7441462705337
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.	12785.514771881333
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs.	14453.202729513696
As on the first day he bargained with me here.	8565.779026105974
As it was in the beginning, is now.	5492.649022307782
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be.	10002.450910228621
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end.	11625.242077720133
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor.	9550.432318070809
Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.	11070.802579368075
— First, our little financial settlement, he said.	3020.4436476749815
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong.	8482.646846718002
— Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.	4415.93456253971
And now his strongroom for the gold.	6452.762856669978
Stephen ’ s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir ’ s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James.	13556.41657378366
An old pilgrim ’ s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.	10790.489866667127
A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.	10499.139516137231
— Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.	4451.593774418514
These are handy things to have.	10271.638465983418
See.	3447.41254620683
This is for sovereigns.	6876.889248521656
This is for shillings.	5650.671089528672
Sixpences, halfcrowns.	18227.54902377354
And here crowns.	5379.175272904213
See.	3447.41254620683
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.	7634.331942435349
— Three twelve, he said.	1211.2725501286693
I think you ’ ll find that ’ s right.	2923.628534631473
— Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.	5597.978753026533
— No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said.	2067.7581929883077
You have earned it.	2670.8848354816455
Stephen ’ s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells.	7211.162742946403
Symbols too of beauty and of power.	14408.498170178329
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.	11254.209584523613
— Don ’ t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said.	2209.320177571457
You ’ ll pull it out somewhere and lose it.	5329.8151572442
You just buy one of these machines.	8493.413241183483
You ’ ll find them very handy.	5828.041951429318
Answer something.	10377.688596154409
— Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.	3091.139435246708
The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same.	8147.401404818588
Three times now.	5035.079115046065
Three nooses round me here.	7039.4111553122375
Well?	3294.9718417722875
I can break them in this instant if I will.	7212.356487214595
— Because you don ’ t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger.	4676.31599296315
You don ’ t know yet what money is.	3460.161759280403
When you have lived as long as I have.	6989.966642662025
I know, I know.	1655.8900974072048
If youth but knew.	7906.1952250009535
But what does Shakespeare say?	6505.458000721054
_Put but money in thy <URL> — Iago, Stephen murmured.	16641.848572595103
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man ’ s stare.	8005.843531928815
— He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said.	2727.3860803902567
He made money.	2630.361253693295
A poet, yes, but an Englishman too.	5966.177726484316
Do you know what is the pride of the English?	6407.637566063338
The seas ’ ruler.	5347.354675808615
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.	12294.57493896825
— That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.	4852.854337905222
— Ba! Mr Deasy cried.	5537.514004862904
That ’ s not English.	1918.8259178597095
A French Celt said that.	4358.673710757683
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.	7813.383105598611
— I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast.	4536.194831943698
_I paid my <URL> Good man, good man.	11293.533373888054
_ — I paid my way.	2919.883823153325
I never borrowed a shilling in my <URL> Can you feel that?	7372.6853570260655
_I owe <URL> Can you?	8840.844161076078
Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.	15432.848044678716
Curran, ten guineas.	15393.437240218329
McCann, one guinea.	15670.23916064639
Fred Ryan, two shillings.	10944.801588933844
Temple, two lunches.	17934.51280191025
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks ’ board.	15441.272984311045
The lump I have is useless.	8256.735412511429
— For the moment, no, Stephen answered.	3955.9847393810173
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.	10700.992364058971
— I knew you couldn ’ t, he said joyously.	3233.424672842303
But one day you must feel it.	5305.520087112126
We are a generous people but we must also be just.	9766.538049078712
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.	11664.43493674959
— You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.	6647.081551219139
I saw three generations since O ’ Connell ’ s time.	5705.950470228912
I remember the famine in ’ <NUM>.	5676.157253362885
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O ’ Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue?	11372.690369627737
You fenians forget some things.	7228.5880489208985
Glorious, pious and immortal memory.	13176.725275995015
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes.	11108.76392175475
Hoarse, masked and armed, the planters ’ covenant.	16679.541019279837
The black north and true blue bible.	7892.112365389898
Croppies lie down.	9484.232932024102
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.	10261.908396014775
— I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said.	2823.1996634460756
On the spindle side.	4421.315044414791
But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union.	10690.088440532774
We are all Irish, all kings ’ sons.	7742.442600016728
— Alas, Stephen said.	1185.6471462137035
— _Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto.	7519.111972302823
He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.	10084.530896959197
Lal the ral the ra The rocky road to Dublin.	10383.673081556011
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots.	10047.931632725
Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!...	5216.959762083555
Day!...	1722.2823681291736
Day!...	1722.2823681291736
Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin.	9052.585465060214
Lal the ral the ra.	11257.209561005606
Lal the ral the raddy.	11928.367605722959
— That reminds me, Mr Deasy said.	1649.776409888137
You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends.	7900.599327623666
I have a letter here for the press.	4901.021035050532
Sit down a moment.	6830.535641808734
I have just to copy the end.	4474.044622167406
He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.	11260.148672047137
— Sit down.	2088.6546146008554
Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of common <URL> Just a moment.	7778.381115225734
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.	13276.498030367276
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.	11047.319828499174
Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings ’ _Repulse_, the duke of Westminster ’ s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort ’ s _Ceylon_, _prix de Paris_, <NUM>.	14493.600613423981
Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign.	15089.832449313308
— Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys.	6810.115426423151
_But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question... _ Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush.	13632.549320728172
Even money _Fair <URL> Ten to one the field.	9516.752306798806
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher ’ s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.	15923.179132494299
Shouts rang shrill from the boys ’ playfield and a whirring whistle.	15589.74258408449
Again: a goal.	12122.494431106408
I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life.	7884.307248340328
You mean that knockkneed mother ’ s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick?	10363.408510673371
Jousts.	16997.075953601572
Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.	12658.86257756761
Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men ’ s bloodied guts.	14954.365733188695
— Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.	4257.118992212199
Stephen stood up.	2614.7683653782924
— I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said.	3417.674423214926
It ’ s about the foot and mouth disease.	3355.5700686405476
Just look through it.	4886.045155459887
There can be no two opinions on the matter.	9402.016623306676
May I trespass on your valuable space.	11285.260159106338
That doctrine of _laissez faire_ which so often in our history.	11245.976023193178
Our cattle trade.	8773.199070725987
The way of all our old industries.	7037.588633927694

By a woman who was no better than she should be.	7795.361540920887
To come to the point at issue.	9279.921490448818
— I don ’ t mince words, do I?	2921.9437628431633
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.	5577.414050687993
Foot and mouth disease.	7416.366126245317
Known as Koch ’ s preparation.	17733.374887165555

Mr Henry Blackwood Price.	8277.958716403939
Courteous offer a fair trial.	14898.407672595516
Dictates of common sense.	15976.465495210923
Allimportant question.	12198.247354477637
In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns.	8400.810695741995
Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.	15386.373732730151
— I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said.	3362.4274668872495
You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle.	10592.520365669598
And it can be cured.	6568.362803315308
It is cured.	3800.5953369850913
My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there.	12161.520907616976
They offer to come over here.	6385.226440256649
I am trying to work up influence with the department.	7442.5428199245725
I am surrounded by difficulties, by...	2822.1048315168528
intrigues by...	2830.120774267867
backstairs influence by...	3641.6053150721245
He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.	9591.04850955952
— Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said.	1876.353983168113
England is in the hands of the jews.	9786.277901951711
In all the highest places: her finance, her press.	10997.869611735157
And they are the signs of a nation ’ s decay.	8427.58546196677
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation ’ s vital strength.	16240.42402187061
I have seen it coming these years.	5523.156599310196
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.	14182.378987337597
Old England is dying.	9870.538417039283
He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam.	10846.177773532514
He faced about and back again.	3911.8190175355026
— Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.	4708.627343370663
The harlot ’ s cry from street to street Shall weave old England ’ s windingsheet.	8845.446275123357
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted.	10770.6907086641
— A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?	7457.519057646965
— They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely.	4815.0848025950545
And you can see the darkness in their eyes.	6486.625476756741
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day.	8182.447371373077
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers.	10331.59815286176
Gabble of geese.	14188.216383417554
They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats.	12501.096989138552
Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.	12876.717020530908
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain.	14291.48657714527
Vain patience to heap and hoard.	15876.993085270278
Time surely would scatter all.	7704.1340550206705
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.	8137.242525774275
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.	13105.085866365058
— Who has not?	2471.195897982432
Stephen said.	707.0646941246576
— What do you mean?	2289.8818898336935
Mr Deasy asked.	2087.4408588167494
He came forward a pace and stood by the table.	5530.038111340443
His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly.	9510.26575516507
Is this old wisdom?	10636.330535903431
He waits to hear from me.	3795.3089233945666
— History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.	5977.529931183298
From the playfield the boys raised a shout.	9661.970294242754
A whirring whistle: goal.	6787.829737165026
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?	10938.37976702906
— The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said.	3908.5359612611555
All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.	10741.224328429194
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying: — That is God.	7623.90028360858
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee! — What?	9714.86368470331
Mr Deasy asked.	2087.4408588167494
— A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.	5481.850209903536
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers.	9693.219515799678
Looking up again he set them free.	11693.817488620816
— I am happier than you are, he said.	1692.9226860646859
We have committed many errors and many sins.	9102.927804298684
A woman brought sin into the world.	3337.6031207365477
For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy.	10673.651277680587
A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough ’ s wife and her leman, O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	10953.251645162933
A woman too brought Parnell low.	6897.2271160708615
Many errors, many failures but not the one sin.	13230.166210768646
I am a struggler now at the end of my days.	4683.851484950224
But I will fight for the right till the end.	7725.698291377975
For Ulster will fight And Ulster will be right.	9260.062018556508
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.	4407.569030679927
— Well, sir, he began.	2393.653829089803
— I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work.	6389.312725318972
You were not born to be a teacher, I think.	5505.442895312935
Perhaps I am wrong.	11204.307460022184
— A learner rather, Stephen said.	1588.34879861408
And here what will you learn more?	8580.931484582636
Mr Deasy shook his head.	3314.4609388927242
— Who knows?	2068.451844483321
he said.	497.15978922676095
To learn one must be humble.	10397.67984044477
But life is the great teacher.	9381.270991162108
Stephen rustled the sheets again.	6049.313421102628
— As regards these, he began.	5063.74864457838
— Yes, Mr Deasy said.	580.5681054458672
You have two copies there.	4026.369302358223
If you can have them published at once.	6307.91246189819
_ Telegraph.	4942.767234847183
Irish <URL> — I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow.	7663.448294675794
I know two editors slightly.	4859.453311118805
— That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly.	3192.574489137747
I wrote last night to Mr Field, <URL>. There is a meeting of the cattletraders ’ association today at the City Arms hotel.	10617.008031579147
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting.	7481.653655793852
You see if you can get it into your two papers.	8347.570848378418
What are they?	3982.6816666487034
_ — The Evening Telegraph... _ — That will do, Mr Deasy said.	3085.1407532037647
There is no time to lose.	7260.965997723569
Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin.	10702.34158625343
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.	2814.0159877757314
Thank you.	2683.281056603683
— Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.	6209.02934628521
I like to break a lance with you, old as I am.	7643.286893198814
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.	4162.135319724462
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.	10157.746379399861
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors.	10520.370036365226
Still I will help him in his fight.	9759.84886276011
Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.	14782.49275769644
— Mr Dedalus! Running after me.	4035.764507940053
No more letters, I hope.	7701.698363133649
— Just one moment.	2897.014632416052
— Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.	2103.0605492730583
Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.	7909.070557210514
— I just wanted to say, he said.	1400.366119219276
Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews.	11593.372097563462
Do you know that?	1875.3563309332574
No. And do you know why?	5911.028681533979
He frowned sternly on the bright air.	6390.770922366793
— Why, sir?	1487.460938156813
Stephen asked, beginning to smile.	6299.144713139255
— Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.	6571.257082463403
He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air.	6849.437675113895
— She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path.	10518.66824161122
That ’ s why.	1499.6453484102078
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.	12837.308146505107
Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes.	11879.131074802166
Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot.	14714.909243785978
Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs.	17356.98505688499
Limits of the diaphane.	16889.070295090147
But he adds: in bodies.	7125.3190014199245
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured.	10089.31644867636
How?	2565.614153239221
By knocking his sconce against them, sure.	9796.690105152104
Go easy.	9886.219821179826
Bald he was and a millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_.	13199.93192423385
Limit of the diaphane in.	10602.89419798067
Why in?	6051.923356353382
Diaphane, adiaphane.	16807.8688531982
If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door.	9524.769190262856
Shut your eyes and see.	6897.08535990071
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells.	10467.35805088095
You are walking through it howsomever.	7850.4926865518155
A very short space of time through very short times of space.	10326.037938422176
Five, six: the _nacheinander_.	13103.283350515547
Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible.	13866.14110788388
Open your eyes.	6223.195741768475
No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles o ’ er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_ ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark.	9930.73909354552
My ash sword hangs at my side.	9027.772259756068
Tap with it: they do.	7478.659954179196
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, _nebeneinander_.	11843.690626574986
Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los Demiurgos_.	16260.91410906428
Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?	13000.857532127482
Crush, crack, crick, crick.	17451.741161329435
Wild sea money.	9501.712831390145
Dominie Deasy kens them a ’.	16703.187899601056
Won ’ t you come to Sandymount, Madeline the mare?	9179.273538045936
Rhythm begins, you see.	6546.914563673101
I hear.	1572.6921591498342
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching.	8872.426401277515
No, agallop: _deline the mare_.	7709.318739391698
Open your eyes now.	6525.781283655499
I will.	1457.0657355478136
One moment.	3116.7207134604323
Has all vanished since?	12681.168245145993
If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane.	9106.760933208288
_Basta! _ I will see if I can see.	9990.300972805046
See now.	3035.295499932044
There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.	8307.26249358378
They came down the steps from Leahy ’ s terrace prudently, _Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand.	12398.732145941724
Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother.	11446.627083807283
Number one swung lourdily her midwife ’ s bag, the other ’ s gamp poked in the beach.	12463.975289480952
From the liberties, out for the day.	5433.530117737148
Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street.	13998.512694151634
One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.	7788.404484062257
Creation from nothing.	9111.320831196861
What has she in the bag?	8087.062807242542
A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.	10932.37001595071
The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh.	9912.221300404195
That is why mystic monks.	6732.846921858524
Will you be as gods?	10971.935350818929
Gaze in your _omphalos_.	14935.12146214515
Hello.	4086.330067868833
Kinch here.	6556.757744001915
Put me on to Edenville.	13496.987606234015
Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.	12997.781015755758
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve.	16635.20222040894
She had no navel.	4699.743204712267
Gaze.	11785.351918411056
Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting.	14427.474299716407
Womb of sin.	10359.026144497928
Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten.	16133.128852656657
By them, the man with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.	11422.645469920722
From before the ages He willed me and now may not will me away or ever.	12962.373612595104
A _lex eterna_ stays about Him.	8433.94953544488
Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial?	11850.254730720791
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions?	9812.219772019043
Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality.	14768.61764386904
Illstarred heresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.	17077.27317322857
With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.	14694.494386719914
Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs.	16230.902036938878

Get down, baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar ’ s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.	15641.182122095302
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it.	6507.918027492418
Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.	15374.762490818264

Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I?	8012.896060517655
He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil.	9501.635873936535
Turn back.	6258.357979047961
Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new sockets.	15389.9889602936
The cold domed room of the tower waits.	7479.660205356317
Through the barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor.	14089.981430544754
Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night.	11556.307989666633
In the darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned platters.	12197.178476931802
Who to clear it?	5475.448469780499
He has the key.	3325.8897566903247
I will not sleep there when this night comes.	7015.290928591308
A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer.	12912.850074677837
Call: no answer.	8695.536099726765
He lifted his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders.	9372.501535464055
Take all, keep all.	8094.4245185686905
My soul walks with me, form of forms.	8392.881943043298
So in the moon ’ s midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore ’ s tempting flood.	12689.210654851684
The flood is following me.	4084.9595658549133
I can watch it flow past from here.	5421.191101896507
Get back then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there.	10423.01471715049
He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a grike.	12487.898321094819
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack.	10927.555576772596
_Un coche ensablé_ Louis Veuillot called Gautier ’ s prose.	16746.646568221393
These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here.	11911.872878298811
And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats.	11965.622458996504
Hide gold there.	8081.731968989237
Try it.	2764.223207718086
You have some.	4143.896509848711
Sands and stones.	13211.676169013319
Heavy of the past.	7736.536674559421
Sir Lout ’ s toys.	13251.207900787955
Mind you don ’ t get one bang on the ear.	7370.218301631886
I ’ m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones.	7848.940148499428
Feefawfum.	19456.598729469286
I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman.	9168.77625240336
A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.	11562.424043699699
Lord, is he going to attack me?	8923.851355985797
Respect his liberty.	16807.8688531982
You will not be master of others or their slave.	10594.74434872346
I have my stick.	3192.665129391787
Sit tight.	11151.046259204404
From farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two.	12292.306061228868
The two maries.	5018.299809366881
They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.	9813.248393912692
Peekaboo.	19456.598729469286
I see you.	1281.055667710622
No, the dog.	4115.432008934416
He is running back to them.	3327.8754089491026
Who?	2501.556219488948
Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf.	16360.759968595905
Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold.	14931.812306679703
A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows.	12562.949240475582
Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers ’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat.	14123.535644687232
Famine, plague and slaughters.	17724.87334026543
Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.	11546.12007312495
I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires.	11347.988794924246
I spoke to no - one: none to me.	4700.078145461899
The dog ’ s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back.	8062.933885924059
Dog of my enemy.	15669.844398552317
I just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about.	7669.303722847742
_Terribilia meditans_.	18679.07077551165
A primrose doublet, fortune ’ s knave, smiled on my fear.	10578.52421791029
For that are you pining, the bark of their applause?	12555.167913630634
Pretenders: live their lives.	12356.695753315393
The Bruce ’ s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York ’ s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned.	13163.924212539701
All kings ’ sons.	6469.133859205179
Paradise of pretenders then and now.	9790.281273152063
He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur ’ s yelping.	11461.662873426425
But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house.	9247.43798179983
House of...	2058.79898048628
We don ’ t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities.	6479.690417162623
Would you do what he did?	9457.491695928806
A boat would be near, a lifebuoy.	10063.231910695533
_Natürlich_, put there for you.	8041.194984996577
Would you or would you not?	8037.735698788252
The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden ’ s rock.	8150.550366239519
They are waiting for him now.	4166.1049578716
The truth, spit it out.	4234.518021820742
I would want to.	2844.3661267658854
I would try.	4764.6143679335455
I am not a strong swimmer.	4966.28568071753
Water cold soft.	15868.195079096857
When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes.	9573.120503749356
Can ’ t see! Who ’ s behind me?	4608.339591043484
Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured?	13681.61788787863
If I had land under my feet.	6374.223529526787
I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine.	8561.163141284887
A drowning man.	3236.042384053853
His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death.	9215.144278215761
I...	332.49087770942975
With him together down...	2876.952526023074
I could not save her.	3227.5053959282054
Waters: bitter death: lost.	14559.59714877062
A woman and a man.	3278.1853465894906
I see her skirties.	4673.274548306118
Pinned up, I bet.	14915.361086819299
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all sides.	13009.980915864582
Looking for something lost in a past life.	8376.289663078796
Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull.	15795.047583624408
The man ’ s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears.	6164.403396671305
He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks.	9590.797351129933
On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired.	12651.051280668853
At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears.	11039.040182812221
His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse.	12145.050074592722
They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.	13610.8704490521
Cocklepickers.	19456.598729469286
They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out.	10516.56372066659
The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning.	12260.8443536151
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf ’ s tongue redpanting from his jaws.	15705.66573897078
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf ’ s gallop.	12151.020750065914
The carcass lay on his path.	6275.6789187822915
He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog ’ s bedraggled fell.	11434.378045483045
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal.	12037.640378947854
Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody ’ s body.	9158.419106351143
— Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel! The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight.	13094.671891711667
He slunk back in a curve.	7228.763391088462
Doesn ’ t see me.	3220.982778362085
Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it.	12212.234957969162
He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock.	11489.56204985075
The simple pleasures of the poor.	7613.549782242601
His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.	12646.398564107543
He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.	12216.780372918183
Wait.	1316.9653973396455
Street of harlots.	10225.679268481821
Remember.	7139.47612196162
Haroun al Raschid.	14291.704561802877
I am almosting it.	1868.4674121469948
That man led me, spoke.	7775.218182558241
I was not afraid.	4284.752831543088
The melon he had he held against my face.	7279.456160871268
Smiled: creamfruit smell.	15393.126810427384
That was the rule, said.	2841.0158587757687
Red carpet spread.	13814.484028110486
You will see who.	5003.558232269998
Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.	16693.799303709362
His blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck.	12523.966302072507
With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his strolling mort.	12783.382906340004
Spoils slung at her back.	10477.742235126192
About her windraw face hair trailed.	14198.982637419229
Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville.	14958.470623844987
When night hides her body ’ s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired.	14201.923247467177
Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O ’ Loughlin ’ s of Blackpitts.	12563.294393899474
Buss her, wap in rogues ’ rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend ’ s whiteness under her rancid rags.	15603.580570470192
Fumbally ’ s lane that night: the tanyard smells.	15287.06263521813
White thy fambles, red thy gan And thy quarrons dainty is.	8737.746406503698
Couch a hogshead with me then.	11681.052793604595
In the darkmans clip and kiss.	6131.31123948017
Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.	17280.60036854171
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted.	17572.24242205462
Call away let him: _thy quarrons dainty is_.	14800.88746131461
Language no whit worse than his.	14045.810181910081
Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.	15727.582229140009
Passing now.	5647.784504615015
A side eye at my Hamlet hat.	7181.889755428727
If I were suddenly naked here as I sit?	9084.376466539876
I am not.	1573.0891964789228
She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load.	12150.727887565497
A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake.	9089.963323176598
Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea.	14997.683875421744
Behold the handmaid of the moon.	8649.78897962043
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise.	12136.812051476474
Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled.	16225.959100953814
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	11816.888630436475
Here.	1968.8314675885797
Put a pin in that chap, will you?	7846.898374564922
My tablets.	7629.7325899688285
Mouth to her kiss.	10866.668637420526
No. Must be two of em.	7159.7239473841655
Glue em well.	12026.716026539883
Mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	11007.51821192446
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.	12861.358224870783
Oomb, allwombing tomb.	16760.897092969924
His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayaway.	13637.588009972713
Paper.	19456.598729469286
The banknotes, blast them.	4314.3919763789
Old Deasy ’ s letter.	7171.291947155803
Here.	1968.8314675885797
Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words.	12494.420340411556
That ’ s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.	6522.668893393497
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending.	11768.82172595919
Why not endless till the farthest star?	10317.158762532323
Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds.	15691.101587534686
Me sits there with his augur ’ s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.	14703.251237734277
I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back.	8868.243159518239
Endless, would it be mine, form of my form?	15775.129892260737
Who watches me here?	8435.797341390815
Who ever anywhere will read these written words?	11618.322419856315
Signs on a white field.	14304.951337967856
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.	11973.271654410672
The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field.	11920.426314325867
Hold hard.	8195.09019880923
Coloured on a flat: yes, that ’ s right.	7054.415490499946
Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back.	12363.294572370987
Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope.	11553.473305859976
Click does the trick.	11676.696775629372
You find my words dark.	7139.383972043114
Darkness is in our souls do you not think?	15076.316176436772
Flutier.	19456.598729469286
Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.	12661.955432872111
She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes.	9030.355317280899
Now where the blue hell am I bringing her beyond the veil?	13684.805645903813
Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality.	13688.585691384505
She, she, she.	6389.426862288865
What she?	3393.3226573394923
The virgin at Hodges Figgis ’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write.	10381.168291800619
Keen glance you gave her.	10327.637619359517
Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade.	17370.71961024466
She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters.	11481.504951604811
Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup.	15191.032789316898
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.	15669.532578853772
Talk about apple dumplings, _piuttosto_.	15316.311760780676
Where are your wits?	7214.646588966257
Touch me.	3920.751988353316
Soft eyes.	6172.709072129483
Soft soft soft hand.	8632.960173485204
I am lonely here.	2288.7036490807805
O, touch me soon, now.	4495.812233383544
What is that word known to all men?	7128.799008212229
I am quiet here alone.	3827.8062297685733
Sad too.	4644.478909101209
Touch, touch me.	6333.698629418498
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes.	10395.7578947343
That is Kevin Egan ’ s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep.	11249.861206731246
_Et vidit Deus.	18227.54902377354
Et erant valde bona_.	16760.897092969924
Alo! _Bonjour_.	18227.54902377354
Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun.	12498.518329247538
I am caught in this burning scene.	6039.709299260386
Pan ’ s hour, the faunal noon.	15522.681425044502
Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.	17029.71733516725
Pain is far.	12738.522102652154
And no more turn aside and brood.	5762.881049734355
His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck ’ s castoffs, _nebeneinander_.	11103.520540167057
He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another ’ s foot had nested warm.	10401.172315631038
The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove.	10798.417466855275
But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt ’ s shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.	11941.741676848214
_Tiens, quel petit pied! _ Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde ’ s love that dare not speak its name.	12671.570905989292
His arm: Cranly ’ s arm.	6283.689183308518
He now will leave me.	4100.980469759332
And the blame?	3442.082139591061
As I am.	4305.809753521827
As I am.	4305.809753521827
All or not at all.	3919.774661601462
In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing.	12936.636407960974
No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks, swirling, passing.	10605.592930686878
Better get this job over quick.	9822.109835278416
Listen: a fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos.	14931.75476375032
Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks.	15771.864860976895
In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels.	12998.573759620607
And, spent, its speech ceases.	8434.926647534778
It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.	12240.347400179133
Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds.	14596.747580316392
Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall.	13195.112794804345
Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit_.	15883.449210756211
To no end gathered; vainly then released, forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon.	10989.651044911701
Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.	15397.717184665502
Five fathoms out there.	6583.919821195704
Full fathom five thy father lies.	13351.461876171717
At one, he said.	1404.3135461270917
Found drowned.	13423.33993185836
High water at Dublin bar.	11838.236118798442
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells.	15679.690656137174
A corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward.	11100.9177210747
There he is.	1243.7820689976188
Hook it quick.	12738.445015358639
Pull.	14336.178182593083
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.	10838.560757806024
We have him.	2437.9984006486916
Easy now.	7101.5519197493
Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine.	16682.90235283324
A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.	13055.649831173005
God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.	13115.809665877767
Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead.	13703.18594251785
Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.	13473.938655125963
A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue.	9507.92011571393
Seadeath, mildest of all deaths known to man.	12480.120195186517
Old Father Ocean.	10227.348794111555
_Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.	15948.149262976727
Just you give it a fair trial.	9573.887527025574
We enjoyed ourselves immensely.	9316.809644546893
Come.	2315.859250724524
I thirst.	3691.2569932489782
Clouding over.	9493.456854589893
No black clouds anywhere, are there?	8735.31848961145
Thunderstorm.	19456.598729469286
Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, _Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_.	16391.215869843865
No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal shoon.	9768.327070923086
Where?	1599.242359848175
To evening lands.	8536.593002969352
Evening will find itself.	11676.6967809718
He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.	8683.38125183939
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me.	6494.036843384524
All days make their end.	7219.657071478235
By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.	8988.562666497352
Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum.	12324.725163888907
Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet.	13070.359407598044
_Già_.	12971.327416137423
For the old hag with the yellow teeth.	6928.7115150153895
_Già_.	12971.327416137423
My teeth are very bad.	8717.461162319043
Why, I wonder.	4913.815757170027
Feel.	8172.165736889734
That one is going too.	4593.377455767297
Shells.	19456.598729469286
Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money?	12083.58442266138
That one.	2159.855446110928
This.	4891.821109978673
Toothless Kinch, the superman.	15607.724317384918
Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?	10008.15070937428
My handkerchief.	6067.840661158367
He threw it.	1637.2010922868776
I remember.	1517.8982028196872
Did I not take it up?	7633.816303518746
His hand groped vainly in his pockets.	7438.755050318398
No, I didn ’ t.	1807.8370738501335
Better buy one.	5067.217703892381
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully.	11049.386933964988
For the rest let look who will.	7503.112053154824
Behind.	13490.99621301991
Perhaps there is someone.	11004.181186671047
He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant.	7901.115789215809
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.	14323.287932836978
Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.	10742.640815285542
He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods ’ roes.	12627.609677503418
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.	14475.781225989851
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray.	14737.288249706
Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.	13784.581072604557
Made him feel a bit peckish.	15321.750370888505
Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right.	10395.152093543675
She didn ’ t like her plate full.	4591.641350086176
Right.	4326.4089046735135
He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire.	8805.916045720287
It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out.	9307.086138278959
Cup of tea soon.	14642.951855761456
Good.	3567.3665975662016
Mouth dry.	10785.019011431155
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.	7001.42496851758
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing.	7800.582166959719
Just how she stalks over my writingtable.	12380.56600998126
Prr.	12971.327416137423
Scratch my head.	10227.658231733418
Prr.	12971.327416137423
Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form.	7166.39676786454
Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes.	13569.66145039576
He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.	6120.692698508023
— Milk for the pussens, he said.	2240.9811284735197
— Mrkgnao! the cat cried.	5537.01177395645
They call them stupid.	7781.348628373938
They understand what we say better than we understand them.	8512.985721086266
She understands all she wants to.	6287.748184378201
Vindictive too.	6944.695736638013
Cruel.	11785.351918411056
Her nature.	5050.922786661671
Curious mice never squeal.	14233.55612654143
Seem to like it.	7143.878414054402
Wonder what I look like to her.	5880.162891206343
Height of a tower?	15695.689801072313
No, she can jump me.	3788.866137846518
— Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly.	6060.048178156626
Afraid of the chookchooks.	15046.602799531443
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.	8985.333281993919
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth.	10700.779402923172
He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.	9330.306767221555
Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon ’ s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.	10204.213720110018
— Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.	6905.144863449603
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly.	11358.81732460123
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can ’ t mouse after.	8317.092913021559
Why?	1336.6418951783915
They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips.	7957.5888197663535
Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.	6868.653578274833
He listened to her licking lap.	7388.728828698976
Ham and eggs, no.	8722.563485712853
No good eggs with this drouth.	9252.627621762342
Want pure fresh water.	8258.003219149472
Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley ’ s.	10707.35231223002
Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.	15390.169631436516
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz ’ s.	5861.016539500789
While the kettle is boiling.	11729.895790606815
Why are their tongues so rough?	10906.505212517332
To lap better, all porous holes.	11452.352695939882
Nothing she can eat?	11268.708086814868
He glanced round him.	2368.312207025354
She might like something tasty.	8430.161584690508
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning.	9077.225343341242
Still perhaps: once in a way.	5323.717816473115
He said softly in the bare hall: — I ’ m going round the corner.	4622.766604678869
Be back in a minute.	7175.798322134033
And when he had heard his voice say it he added: — You don ’ t want anything for breakfast?	6871.559459990438
A sleepy soft grunt answered: — Mn. No. She didn ’ t want anything.	7345.9128672997595
Must get those settled really.	7183.657379922028
Pity.	7168.595020610842
All the way from Gibraltar.	6541.301229704893
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew.	12634.49549941245
Wonder what her father gave for it.	5457.529067994093
Old style.	6892.576291904867
Ah yes! of course.	6117.815785323554
Bought it at the governor ’ s auction.	12957.182855104727
Got a short knock.	7865.280025578055
Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy.	12672.81095713114
Yes, sir.	577.8527243814603
At Plevna that was.	4962.915973853065
I rose from the ranks, sir, and I ’ m proud of it.	3864.341503957183
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps.	11264.835806080853
Now that was farseeing.	8861.999652740622
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof.	11861.896064688224
Stamps: stickyback pictures.	15976.304393411037
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too.	10731.658884166127
Course they do.	6184.191701496143
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto ’ s high grade ha.	9997.158103891546
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband.	7056.961114558107
White slip of paper.	7297.167699779382
Quite safe.	10571.668153790324
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey.	9160.149250999604
In the trousers I left off.	4710.395288782794
Must get it.	2710.238439110401
Potato I have.	8179.096348612182
Creaky wardrobe.	18679.07077551165
No use disturbing her.	3795.2009551245205
She turned over sleepily that time.	5861.12083900576
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.	12319.68829437101
Looked shut.	12491.919836756957
All right till I come back anyhow.	8297.565865531462
He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive.	10662.531057645536
The sun was nearing the steeple of George ’ s church.	6903.0632366622285
Be a warm day I fancy.	11907.505697467714
Specially in these black clothes feel it more.	12757.911484830414
Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat.	9406.043996693092
But I couldn ’ t go in that light suit.	5723.316866246671
Make a picnic of it.	3916.331372119458
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth.	10356.957274334378
Boland ’ s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday ’ s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.	16486.15181233158
Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn.	14096.889292371496
Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day ’ s march on him.	7887.897079020555
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.	13620.291627245191
Walk along a strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy ’ s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.	13882.061088595376
Wander through awned streets.	15393.126810427384
Turbaned faces going by.	12966.750576081717
Dark caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe.	14041.599374283956
Cries of sellers in the streets.	14228.823977111882
Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet.	14766.186608803248
Dander along all day.	9345.35393000258
Might meet a robber or two.	9348.192831833569
Well, meet him.	2909.635224560336
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up.	8752.74826847884
A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind.	8919.909475479473
I pass on.	2656.2054340142813
Fading gold sky.	14632.453786752065
A mother watches me from her doorway.	8588.227294600185
She calls her children home in their dark language.	9611.81350930358
High wall: beyond strings twanged.	13840.059309081214
Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly ’ s new garters.	11977.739295912676
Strings.	19456.598729469286
Listen.	5813.562960239262
I pass.	2804.8760523230562
Probably not a bit like it really.	11901.066238585074
Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun.	8990.21161759076
Sunburst on the titlepage.	17988.060839863898
He smiled, pleasing himself.	4174.4300872979065
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland.	10091.06018633758
He prolonged his pleased smile.	6156.342792987853
Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	10611.382588075769
He approached Larry O ’ Rourke ’ s.	2977.1295898099943
From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter.	9452.628284183107
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.	14317.859050027067
Good house, however: just the end of the city traffic.	9660.634407634903
For instance M ’ Auley ’ s down there: n.	10409.171741420345
g.	11785.351918411056
as position.	13423.441441187648
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.	11114.251117212947
Baldhead over the blind.	14561.940424731056
Cute old codger.	16807.8688531982
No use canvassing him for an ad.	7066.326534553543
Still he knows his own business best.	8246.29286400646
There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket.	11145.072328572114
Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up.	11070.144422797901
Do you know what I ’ m going to tell you?	2552.045021854318
What ’ s that, Mr O ’ Rourke?	2680.1305034791817
Do you know what?	2227.14596922448
The Russians, they ’ d only be an eight o ’ clock breakfast for the Japanese.	10055.797706098016
Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps.	10734.932895778022
Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O ’ Rourke.	8529.191648451635
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway: — Good day, Mr O ’ Rourke.	9676.218425618838
— Good day to you.	2004.6032072369342
— Lovely weather, sir.	2219.7108898817273
— ’ Tis all that.	3181.4639256795613
Where do they get the money?	7818.9451956793455
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar.	13513.10186132576
Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.	12114.460159100965
Then think of the competition.	8075.960666520535
General thirst.	11484.279349821476
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub.	11977.849250662674
Save it they can ’ t.	5013.968520788687
Off the drunks perhaps.	9475.034318717664
Put down three and carry five.	12449.606720124923
What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs.	6728.056539078021
Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers.	15327.60630223858
Square it you with the boss and we ’ ll split the job, see?	11553.002856155454
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month?	11424.675644432748
Say ten barrels of stuff.	10711.520066989582
Say he got ten per cent off.	10078.776547977352
O more.	3130.0971650732104
Fifteen.	9780.093555557632
He passed Saint Joseph ’ s National school.	5998.919157229873
Brats ’ clamour.	18227.54902377354
Windows open.	10940.817986651593

Slieve Bloom.	7216.02796682868
He halted before Dlugacz ’ s window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies, black and white.	9923.135463223221
Fifteen multiplied by.	9615.078977062289
The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade.	10220.423036261458
The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs ’ blood.	12920.340461526011
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last.	9373.582033207367
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter.	5646.3180715154895
Would she buy it too, calling the items from a slip in her hand?	13521.761650630468
Chapped: washingsoda.	18227.54902377354
And a pound and a half of Denny ’ s sausages.	8100.477629834489
His eyes rested on her vigorous hips.	8148.913190446251
Woods his name is.	8241.782015536653

No followers allowed.	7503.861566893145
Strong pair of arms.	12495.067006784804
Whacking a carpet on the clothesline.	17611.3779298435
She does whack it, by George.	8671.061103913065
The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.	8846.196635313849
Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.	16010.766977916983
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias.	10473.236682525787
Can become ideal winter sanatorium.	12159.041578720957
Moses Montefiore.	16878.573427268955
I thought he was.	2005.5630702696144
Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping.	15642.615317242138
He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling.	11890.606375643416
A young white heifer.	6004.36764451828
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there ’ s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands.	12436.706662790719
He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest.	10331.627380449952
The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.	8495.043189786402
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace.	11157.560177315409
— Now, my miss, he said.	1708.1350275822024
She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.	9866.836949836568
— Thank you, my miss.	2985.431241067963
And one shilling threepence change.	5948.864576425656
Mr Bloom pointed quickly.	3619.8767407063133
To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams.	13759.156441275614
Pleasant to see first thing in the morning.	7743.119545877109
Hurry up, damn it.	6400.0316384746075
Make hay while the sun shines.	12754.825836316932
He sighed down his nose: they never understand.	8869.23433402865
Sodachapped hands.	9746.985431243196
Crusted toenails too.	8259.744991340982
Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.	15071.841531723836
The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast.	9440.147876596893
For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles ’ Lane.	13001.414307784753
They like them sizeable.	7146.100756477012
Prime sausage.	18679.07077551165
O please, Mr Policeman, I ’ m lost in the wood.	6771.452147934768
— Threepence, please.	3273.8235161715597
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.	9191.498104799562
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers ’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles.	12589.874648710449
They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.	12564.827435508229
— Thank you, sir.	901.6601118659293
Another time.	4875.370467105958
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him.	6474.572561565941
He withdrew his gaze after an instant.	6374.433160077097
No: better not: another time.	6181.84178666445
— Good morning, he said, moving away.	2321.6873810679012
— Good morning, sir.	1077.6134152555062
No sign.	4680.40855470827
Gone.	4782.2098951201715
What matter?	4465.559862111875
He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely.	7438.527260265559
Agendath Netaim: planters ’ company.	12984.196184359787
To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees.	12907.35919166668
Excellent for shade, fuel and construction.	15446.537005829745
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.	15948.149262976727
You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons.	13840.197951093303
Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation.	15245.551398172447
Every year you get a sending of the crop.	14449.387709180883
Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union.	12315.488092024636
Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments.	12930.160566725886
Bleibtreustrasse <NUM>, Berlin, W.	8574.305722975696
<NUM>.	2614.8788117536697
Nothing doing.	9552.652769879744
He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat.	6468.49701213369
Silverpowdered olivetrees.	18679.07077551165
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening.	16683.014503971313
Olives are packed in jars, eh?	9843.870164669976
I have a few left from Andrews.	4990.095963080139
Molly spitting them out.	6210.561655171267
Knows the taste of them now.	9266.647352455147
Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.	17451.741161329435
Citrons too.	6944.695736638013
Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin ’ s parade.	10048.85530678743
And Mastiansky with the old cither.	8098.398712098142
Pleasant evenings we had then.	11115.984749487341
Molly in Citron ’ s basketchair.	10338.510941192813
Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.	14126.470759913487
Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume.	9469.782247185198
Always the same, year after year.	8932.65472664406
They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me.	6825.152817505767
Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times.	13509.976010758848
Must be without a flaw, he said.	2406.2980175891303
Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant.	14957.198274180928
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees.	15403.345293546738
There ’ s whatdoyoucallhim out of.	3501.7326661177003
How do you?	1919.4046437571424
Doesn ’ t see.	3207.532520103648
Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore.	13472.14143623252
His back is like that Norwegian captain ’ s.	5548.178540061492
Watering cart.	13656.980144780438
To provoke the rain.	7070.468035935051
On earth as it is in heaven.	8608.934067256003
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly.	7679.398821000108
Grey.	15443.024084639697
Far.	5148.297548157808
No, not like that.	1938.2818824886344
A barren land, bare waste.	8872.795405711773
Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth.	12326.786752031365
No wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters.	11685.630767508652
Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom.	15657.43516531358
All dead names.	6115.272611517478
A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old.	9076.301604111963
Old now.	3448.631232730838
It bore the oldest, the first race.	7921.633641186776
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy ’ s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.	8658.589289153953
The oldest people.	3870.086822113362
Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere.	14118.621067325936
It lay there now.	3349.9221487274917
Now it could bear no more.	6796.898913688432
Dead: an old woman ’ s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.	7097.7389161800875
Desolation.	19456.598729469286
Grey horror seared his flesh.	12039.061248731015
Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward.	15028.829316575999
Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.	14764.190930449318
Well, I am here now.	2780.8075822915457
Yes, I am here now.	2356.6719881290715
Morning mouth bad images.	15976.304393411037
Got up wrong side of the bed.	4520.672614903178
Must begin again those Sandow ’ s exercises.	11115.054101368441
On the hands down.	2815.885811172645
Blotchy brown brick houses.	14932.487582743639
Number eighty still unlet.	15393.126810427384
Why is that?	2385.212740394376
Valuation is only twentyeight.	17932.795353842193
Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills.	16620.83499779619
Plasters on a sore eye.	12228.07473593741
To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter.	11992.0695832977
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh.	10379.482852452962
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath.	15540.31703783317
Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.	13333.72569455336
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor.	12225.123355076716
He stooped and gathered them.	3857.532795856641
Mrs Marion Bloom.	3221.0437041676205
His quickened heart slowed at once.	6257.479460486196
Bold hand.	5156.771231408008
Mrs Marion.	3723.6183035565605
— Poldy! Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.	10111.750400904391
— Who are the letters for?	4135.783214697887
He looked at them.	1639.9682570136824
Mullingar.	8498.96645492669
Milly.	7586.596070254145
— A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.	5738.372364640779
And a letter for you.	2848.466488395725
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.	10174.08597786546
— Do you want the blind up?	3641.469614000687
— That do?	1617.8781788103445
he asked, turning.	4438.21107960477
She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.	8773.64990936177
— She got the things, she said.	2485.594488271036
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.	11402.495343619079
— Hurry up with that tea, she said.	2981.588011255536
I ’ m parched.	1739.5214336373215
— The kettle is boiling, he said.	1520.6001470352596
But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.	9243.319102836162
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called: — Poldy! — What?	7678.426655154727
— Scald the teapot.	5817.442423960533
On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout.	10527.457818686424
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in.	11743.250326529307
Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt.	15355.63264206138
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him.	10012.527859194019
Give her too much meat she won ’ t mouse.	9825.487546283333
Say they won ’ t eat pork.	8268.502684556086
Kosher.	11785.351918411056
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce.	10717.089630162152
Pepper.	16997.075953601572
Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.	8750.327582462553
Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan ’ s seaside girls.	12120.695527603872
The tea was drawn.	6121.162195183583
He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby, smiling.	8970.2728134012
Silly Milly ’ s birthday gift.	12195.015347409048
No, wait: four.	4529.975662712343
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke.	7775.931531435396
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her.	10632.06415169295
He smiled, pouring.	4473.280466732035
You are my lookingglass from night to morning.	6744.533572761741
I ’ d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.	8218.985364241868
Poor old professor Goodwin.	9771.356995320899
Dreadful old case.	11501.501715634753
Still he was a courteous old chap.	6985.8696185264735
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform.	14244.825658111113
And the little mirror in his silk hat.	5138.8417852586645
O, look what I found in professor Goodwin ’ s hat! All we laughed.	8063.156593229556
Sex breaking out even then.	11777.959572182906
Pert little piece she was.	9666.047342359085
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray.	11838.227529581427
Its hump bumped as he took it up.	7659.4864706885
Everything on it?	6937.397834625453
Yes.	804.865728120872
He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.	10242.7703472518
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.	13592.301223629134
— What a time you were! she said.	2908.3922404359205
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat ’ s udder.	12292.756270895727
The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.	11489.356713032481
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow.	10041.292925223333
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.	8978.600328269627
— Who was the letter from?	4548.162589449839
he asked.	1146.2406223222367
Bold hand.	5156.771231408008
Marion.	8886.073477937078
— O, Boylan, she said.	1206.9139968280635
He ’ s bringing the programme.	2951.105661482109
— What are you singing?	3081.366896286942
— _Là ci darem_ with J.	4128.980270754394
Doyle, she said, and _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_.	8545.536054339684
Her full lips, drinking, smiled.	8854.86146671266
Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day.	10899.829520210313
Like foul flowerwater.	9577.811994938531
— Would you like the window open a little?	7588.808823503957
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking: — What time is the funeral?	8797.830424727772
— Eleven, I think, he answered.	5369.01736425972
I didn ’ t see the paper.	2015.396090429673
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed.	12275.098162353952
No?	2592.2942056119323
Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.	12123.173655120827
— No: that book.	3508.7228930607725
Other stocking.	10785.426755531495
Her petticoat.	6824.446401506298
— It must have fell down, she said.	2475.21407702979
He felt here and there.	2887.3429383441767
_Voglio e non vorrei_.	12791.216377669032
Wonder if she pronounces that right: _voglio_.	11319.341215156845
Not in the bed.	3744.41537753326
Must have slid down.	4986.43515957591
He stooped and lifted the valance.	7484.618492183688
The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.	11143.744648799853
— Show here, she said.	1735.6564748543074
I put a mark in it.	3523.9756157932557
There ’ s a word I wanted to ask you.	3210.4199663112568
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.	12033.306932082416
— Met him what?	3901.3687012993782
he asked.	1146.2406223222367
What does that mean?	3988.417740050046
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.	9289.98035370128
— Metempsychosis?	3118.5687368668796
— Yes.	427.3278064178512
— Metempsychosis, he said, frowning.	3148.411727631968
It ’ s Greek: from the Greek.	4553.297766342252
That means the transmigration of souls.	7772.839850686326
— O, rocks! she said.	1458.187830751608
Tell us in plain words.	7697.821396956799
The same young eyes.	3605.1505000795096
The first night after the charades.	6181.721563958132
Dolphin ’ s Barn.	5629.921221450037
He turned over the smudged pages.	5193.9710860897085
_Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_.	17548.01502657226
Hello.	4086.330067868833

Doped animals.	16878.573427268955
Trapeze at Hengler ’ s.	5752.0777503539975
Had to look the other way.	7313.80530217289
Mob gaping.	18679.07077551165
Break your neck and we ’ ll break our sides.	12735.980322883805
Families of them.	5810.051951232139
Bone them young so they metamspychosis.	17571.11337083054
That we live after death.	5197.274474447238
Our souls.	6220.817103705733
That a man ’ s soul after he dies.	7234.7481122208455
Dignam ’ s soul...	2286.4073983371813
— Did you finish it?	2525.8122519009376
he asked.	1146.2406223222367
— Yes, she said.	466.94261952600135
There ’ s nothing smutty in it.	2547.7257387200725
Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?	7273.803098934658
— Never read it.	2277.0136675256645
Do you want another?	5269.413899570251
— Yes.	427.3278064178512
Get another of Paul de Kock ’ s.	6048.087882691666
Nice name he has.	8890.092719877524
She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.	11005.962705257984
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they ’ ll write to Kearney, my guarantor.	11162.11453233213
Reincarnation: that ’ s the word.	4819.926487526184
— Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before.	7575.773104956184
They call it reincarnation.	7781.819241256793
That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.	11334.961438913426
They say we have forgotten it.	4457.670044594054
Some say they remember their past lives.	11365.323423150978
The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea.	8617.794493986969
Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis.	10821.813804269108
An example would be better.	7583.378484889623
The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed.	5738.091976358764
Given away with the Easter number of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours.	15955.25478689191
Tea before you put milk in.	10455.40869991903
Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer.	10914.656897128756
Three and six I gave for the frame.	12268.007313140322
She said it would look nice over the bed.	6616.690898860476
Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.	12979.33017109109
He turned the pages back.	3224.31431475223
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance.	8993.81050855491
What they called nymphs, for example.	7819.373993684321
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar.	12085.229845708556
She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils.	10571.66825680178
— There ’ s a smell of burn, she said.	1697.6583441956823
Did you leave anything on the fire?	9164.189094036874
— The kidney! he cried suddenly.	4483.29727331271
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork ’ s legs.	12833.075028180421
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan.	13086.067396761817
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.	12434.667626002878
Only a little burnt.	10108.172191801026
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.	8705.803691209072
Cup of tea now.	7684.706767828651
He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat.	8996.209522727444
Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat.	10401.089378832241
Done to a turn.	12824.891736690344
A mouthful of tea.	5154.43609120719
Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth.	7094.12144037126
What was that about some young student and a picnic?	8738.069190600447
He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.	10818.360193527138
Dearest Papli Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present.	14829.796610001564
It suits me splendid.	7039.965297790099
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam.	15114.743398610468
I got mummy ’ s lovely box of creams and am writing.	9273.332935695033
They are lovely.	3948.435764904767
I am getting on swimming in the photo business now.	5590.755784809741
Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs.	10188.119118764733
Will send when developed.	11157.329403316393
We did great biz yesterday.	8871.373882008542
Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in.	8876.113569748877
We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic.	10485.199842344531
Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks.	12897.958518587304
I hear them at the piano downstairs.	6209.481324871781
There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.	8171.164614001396
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan ’ s (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan ’ s) song about those seaside girls.	10720.51876900203
Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects.	12461.67683097117
I must now close with fondest love Your fond daughter Milly P.	8040.26639212452
S.	1192.4711296144715
Excuse bad writing am in hurry.	12106.874166052286
M.	1419.2444105626132
Fifteen yesterday.	10861.24296676955
Curious, fifteenth of the month too.	8196.179171726719
Her first birthday away from home.	8016.519992227046
Separation.	19456.598729469286
Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street.	11164.441114243959
Jolly old woman.	9430.662757945924
Lot of babies she must have helped into the world.	7617.28098286222
She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn ’ t live.	8551.80839919631
Well, God is good, sir.	3777.6706808722915
She knew at once.	3590.8410785169103
He would be eleven now if he had lived.	6729.916930670587
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript.	10632.740122991883
Excuse bad writing.	9390.716080749045
Hurry.	10940.661888558341
Piano downstairs.	13208.497172912666
Coming out of her shell.	9585.128310049944
Row with her in the XL Café about the bracelet.	14883.764442042926
Wouldn ’ t eat her cakes or speak or look.	8800.374518999513
Saucebox.	19456.598729469286
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney.	10021.748404437305
Twelve and six a week.	13292.947954645528
Not much.	4128.999074065567
Still, she might do worse.	6824.843254750375
Music hall stage.	12441.952512840195
Young student.	5850.046673331947
He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal.	9326.418901801799
Then he read the letter again: twice.	6894.602640566664
O, well: she knows how to mind herself.	7656.372190373209
But if not?	3596.906827598072
No, nothing has happened.	5851.103955548519
Wait in any case till it does.	8634.939023540783
A wild piece of goods.	7353.14579853298
Her slim legs running up the staircase.	8258.797617641954
Destiny.	12971.327416137423
Ripening now.	7101.5519197493
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window.	7365.019393603457
Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.	11372.130847664459
Anemic a little.	18233.39044294946
Was given milk too long.	9968.577442036156
Damned old tub pitching about.	11192.283589041537
Not a bit funky.	7002.908260008418
Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.	8865.331730538162
All dimpled cheeks and curls, Your head it simply swirls.	9436.82300037565
Seaside girls.	12825.621296894642
Torn envelope.	12825.330371560145
Hands stuck in his trousers ’ pockets, jarvey off for the day, singing.	12763.058632752474
Friend of the family.	12286.2429985448
Swurls, he says.	9966.817996137966
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.	15551.702108778456
Those girls, those girls, Those lovely seaside girls.	7859.663014330021
Milly too.	3792.3731881687895
Young kisses: the first.	8214.25696165504
Far away now past.	9064.278452171557
Mrs Marion.	3723.6183035565605
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.	14522.07197633915
A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing.	11252.994911363132
Will happen, yes.	4747.926225313846
Prevent.	19456.598729469286
Girl ’ s sweet light lips.	9633.199401527541
Will happen too.	4673.762176786576
He felt the flowing qualm spread over him.	5302.084948183039
Useless to move now.	7324.794119017791
Lips kissed, kissing, kissed.	15877.41333945846
Full gluey woman ’ s lips.	6856.94602689461
Better where she is down there: away.	8558.24223586429
Occupy her.	7257.887496615099
Wanted a dog to pass the time.	7134.549828776845
Might take a trip down there.	6754.248247173302
August bank holiday, only two and six return.	14683.909182911299
Six weeks off, however.	10447.725892213304
Might work a press pass.	10196.890195668917
Or through M ’ Coy.	5230.021749428583
The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door.	9478.700338239285
She looked back at him, mewing.	7639.254261230037
Wants to go out.	6447.118683176241
Wait before a door sometime it will open.	10221.72283700408
Let her wait.	5478.353701189833
Has the fidgets.	10470.18113497723
Electric.	16997.075953601572
Thunder in the air.	5401.193316583188
Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too.	9492.344046223923
He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels.	10764.32053755736
He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers.	5614.272245725791
The cat mewed to him.	2394.605054015136
— Miaow! he said in answer.	4553.03755939044
Wait till I ’ m ready.	3936.848423636098
Heaviness: hot day coming.	13894.272362856542
Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.	10195.960412420302
A paper.	2646.242074064825
He liked to read at stool.	7220.606369833396
Hope no ape comes knocking just as I ’ m.	8644.805091120666
In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_.	9352.298522206635
He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it.	5742.648485559966
The cat went up in soft bounds.	7417.824348192951
Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.	7996.962461935504
Listening, he heard her voice: — Come, come, pussy.	13480.845674745215
Come.	2315.859250724524
He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden.	8990.391949305813
No sound.	3556.4221246844227
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.	11908.04562650059
The maid was in the garden.	4813.774152360552
Fine morning.	7126.176919554355
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.	8367.111948735417
Make a summerhouse here.	6105.584116985152
Scarlet runners.	18679.07077551165
Want to manure the whole place over, scabby soil.	11028.141406900528
A coat of liver of sulphur.	8872.527046460265
All soil like that without dung.	9875.39071456093
Household slops.	18679.07077551165
Loam, what is this that is?	12448.196046185942
The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing.	10066.172098986415
Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes.	14251.870566875208
Mulch of dung.	16808.072234878917
Best thing to clean ladies ’ kid gloves.	12802.37239083678
Dirty cleans.	16878.573427268955
Ashes too.	6275.288440716109
Reclaim the whole place.	10637.402789910759
Grow peas in that corner there.	11120.757926280174
Lettuce.	19456.598729469286
Always have fresh greens then.	8539.359165819396
Still gardens have their drawbacks.	10986.391134208527
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.	9912.971040056349
He walked on.	1324.0143685686166
Where is my hat, by the way?	5319.558434266009
Must have put it back on the peg.	8647.502485238017
Or hanging up on the floor.	4488.068862812685
Funny I don ’ t remember that.	3810.4794390025513
Hallstand too full.	13814.400447318581
Four umbrellas, her raincloak.	14303.408378202772
Picking up the letters.	10469.532606231543
Drago ’ s shopbell ringing.	16224.008400008235
Queer I was just thinking that moment.	7788.475980462334
Brown brillantined hair over his collar.	14897.19378749388
Just had a wash and brushup.	10793.459784843217
Wonder have I time for a bath this morning.	8283.980641042279
Tara street.	6273.442628976651
Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say.	7752.708391711298
O ’ Brien.	2427.0706982131196
Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has.	13352.067615109589
Agendath what is it?	4433.806286978828
Now, my miss.	6895.449232694734
Enthusiast.	19456.598729469286
He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes.	7926.749115183292
Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral.	11181.33583912282
He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel.	8743.030068879607
Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces.	15226.736500511046
The king was in his countinghouse.	6718.4540160450815
Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees.	15729.71029494357
Something new and easy.	10428.4144056346
No great hurry.	6247.477407307308
Keep it a bit.	5877.4245792738775
Our prize titbit: _Matcham ’ s Masterstroke_.	13294.889090206256
Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers ’ Club, London.	14049.314358302465
Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer.	12477.066992583113
Three and a half.	6274.375182832972
Three pounds three.	8079.340407734021
Three pounds, thirteen and six.	6685.011711344817
Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second.	13068.050264694608
Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone.	15397.42717131566
Hope it ’ s not too big bring on piles again.	6337.357352047878
No, just right.	3100.9959113403743
So. Ah! Costive.	9286.940005347575
One tabloid of cascara sagrada.	10691.049044173882
Life might be so.	8399.680902401082
It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat.	11285.018158963774
Print anything now.	8408.657709804607
Silly season.	12492.20319340747
He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell.	9255.235861367113
Neat certainly.	15707.520019502692
_Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now_.	14292.399740670067
Begins and ends morally.	16760.897092969924
_Hand in hand_.	16807.8688531982
Smart.	15443.024084639697
He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.	11748.70877524787

Dislike dressing together.	10792.12939254331
Nicked myself shaving.	18227.54902377354
Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt.	16641.344006788437

I ’ m swelled after that cabbage.	3327.8807409728684
A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.	9633.893256309022
Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf.	16091.703651054926
Morning after the bazaar dance when May ’ s band played Ponchielli ’ s dance of the hours.	14130.26914260494
Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours.	14851.514596777568
Washing her teeth.	11560.237619338364
That was the first night.	2603.0073112673626
Her fansticks clicking.	8833.109756411148
Is that Boylan well off?	7452.952125490307
He has money.	2067.7096403077862
Why?	1336.6418951783915
No use humming then.	4424.158552030413
Allude to it.	5529.809901445003
Strange kind of music that last night.	9591.687806881799
The mirror was in shadow.	6032.263353373049
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub.	12629.178098596907
Peering into it.	6550.493811157592
Lines in her eyes.	6362.308833319942
It wouldn ’ t pan out somehow.	6988.278728660172
Evening hours, girls in grey gauze.	15068.876243077393
Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks.	14928.251229729789
Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.	15575.00492901108
Still, true to life also.	7219.162597505618
Day: then the night.	6524.6931376476905
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.	7353.963003330932
Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself.	8513.181597659817
He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.	8373.317966291508
In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees.	12188.782262905319
What time is the funeral?	5397.879891955374
Better find out in the paper.	5902.914440532833
The bells of George ’ s church.	4476.62731193282
They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.	9698.812352211138
Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Quarter to.	5240.457819001258
There again: the overtone following through the air.	7001.773166079658
A third.	4762.787687825449
Poor Dignam! By lorries along sir John Rogerson ’ s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past Windmill lane, Leask ’ s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office.	11571.896989406001
Could have given that address too.	7917.331387417423
And past the sailors ’ home.	6506.792045087207
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.	7306.271168749034
By Brady ’ s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt.	14071.04789902884
A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop.	12313.830005488016
Tell him if he smokes he won ’ t grow.	9121.607454496741
O let him! His life isn ’ t such a bed of roses.	10770.61025550201
Waiting outside pubs to bring da home.	12991.927780624035
Come home to ma, da.	11812.946031072426
Slack hour: won ’ t be many there.	7702.270590794169
He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel.	9930.520390142716
El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth.	15190.84183957064
And past Nichols ’ the undertaker.	8620.578374783647
At eleven it is.	3682.5394213738246
Time enough.	4952.875065457369
Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O ’ Neill ’ s.	7411.23442684032
Corny.	9535.122774413201
Met her once in the park.	8599.066515368697
What a lark.	4194.723251771946
Police tout.	14855.255256694101
Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay.	12218.011774003706
O, surely he bagged it.	3616.822804130466
Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall.	16721.804421343157
With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.	8289.245631031983
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest quality, family tea.	12429.963667301226
Rather warm.	10377.374781666476
Tea.	9031.408469903961
Must get some from Tom Kernan.	8156.223106949692
Couldn ’ t ask him at a funeral, though.	8102.046627086515
While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair.	12239.95587594698
Very warm morning.	7240.2191622358905
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha.	12628.40187731231
Just there.	3454.43639530466
His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat.	6874.90678480212
His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.	9896.110399393176
So warm.	5758.029555222701
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.	8572.267436736523
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands.	10926.29987849115
The far east.	4530.9522090197315
Lovely spot it must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them.	11183.874381769874
Wonder is it like that.	3461.0091072314967
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_, not doing a hand ’ s turn all day.	10922.640746207757
Sleep six months out of twelve.	13855.905246413742
Too hot to quarrel.	10931.877524622356
Influence of the climate.	18069.83914199004
Lethargy.	16997.075953601572
Flowers of idleness.	15868.195079096857
The air feeds most.	5254.300798611078
Azotes.	19456.598729469286
Hothouse in Botanic gardens.	15976.304393411037
Sensitive plants.	15251.62811167228
Waterlilies.	19456.598729469286
Petals too tired to.	10133.747780259715
Sleeping sickness in the air.	5980.364631586516
Walk on roseleaves.	13814.400447318581
Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel.	16160.677580557403
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere?	10039.451363553093
Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.	9308.321747715905
Couldn ’ t sink if you tried: so thick with salt.	11476.432599905098
Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what?	7854.863406740504
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight?	8684.026195879778
It ’ s a law something like that.	1763.634973839373
Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching.	17280.125265615075
The college curriculum.	5018.269448422289
Cracking curriculum.	15251.62811167228
What is weight really when you say the weight?	8107.443473328139
Thirtytwo feet per second per second.	9689.777739409199
Law of falling bodies: per second per second.	11089.531506831941
They all fall to the ground.	5364.431027624292
The earth.	2181.885317841231
It ’ s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.	4918.971914783854
He turned away and sauntered across the road.	4574.614488515359
How did she walk with her sausages?	9355.28368758147
Like that something.	4919.266854911514
As he walked he took the folded _Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.	13423.73537275273
Careless air: just drop in to see.	9787.072621461171
Per second per second.	8507.799758038502
Per second for every second it means.	13069.728265481635
From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice.	9040.195270316528
Too late box.	6820.104977337446
Post here.	7045.6414385246135
In. He handed the card through the brass grill.	10777.61414265193
— Are there any letters for me?	4523.91861336327
he asked.	1146.2406223222367
While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper.	14275.951884912281
No answer probably.	4835.794514545871
Went too far last time.	8798.70009565871
The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.	9987.223737964565
He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.	9524.437525245892
Henry Flower Esq, c / o P.	8782.341629282968
O.	898.7620042054172
Westland Row, City.	14642.50902902742
Answered anyhow.	11107.817728783746
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing again the soldiers on parade.	10930.219461340635
Where ’ s old Tweedy ’ s regiment?	6373.912376590502
Castoff soldier.	18679.07077551165
There: bearskin cap and hackle plume.	11242.615934708358
No, he ’ s a grenadier.	2547.5906470469254
Pointed cuffs.	15707.401234162855
There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.	6980.445198067606
Redcoats.	19456.598729469286
Too showy.	9838.938135192795
That must be why the women go after them.	7743.261473021359
Uniform.	16997.075953601572
Easier to enlist and drill.	16727.42622563514
Maud Gonne ’ s letter about taking them off O ’ Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital.	13214.873989667363
Griffith ’ s paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover empire.	15098.773753403104
Half baked they look: hypnotised like.	11949.352499835222
Mark time.	5797.562218369559
Table: able.	16807.8688531982
Bed: ed.	18227.54902377354
The King ’ s own.	4594.484366364472
Never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby.	11869.888879627726
A mason, yes.	3068.489370712198
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right.	3936.082926088076
Talk: as if that would mend matters.	14935.689556018035
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.	11883.141208454208
Women will pay a lot of heed, I don ’ t think.	5468.823375076016
His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket.	9039.630412742048
Something pinned on: photo perhaps.	9543.266624592809
No. M ’ Coy.	2998.295328951604
Get rid of him quickly.	10692.388944120285
Take me out of my way.	5996.430439019385
Hate company when you.	7898.68869953817
— Hello, Bloom.	1192.928572980409
Where are you off to?	5934.960463666257
— Hello, M ’ Coy.	1829.1746227131957
Nowhere in particular.	14632.453802818965
— How ’ s the body?	2523.8155820462675
— Fine.	2902.1771678372525
How are you?	1927.304803484376
— Just keeping alive, M ’ Coy said.	2257.8451067263813
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect: — Is there any...	7183.009274662339
— O, no, Mr Bloom said.	745.9568961634739
Poor Dignam, you know.	4364.370134999627
The funeral is today.	4219.039792434259
— To be sure, poor fellow.	3877.080741454372
So it is.	2193.5254239501146
What time?	2635.1287379436762
A photo it isn ’ t.	3906.2853768399204
A badge maybe.	5632.710288770732
— E... eleven, Mr Bloom answered.	3306.6312774154712
— I must try to get out there, M ’ Coy said.	2903.5662097921954
Eleven, is it?	4744.839057982206
I only heard it last night.	4697.926617501962
Who was telling me?	3399.118307149287
Holohan.	16997.075953601572
You know Hoppy?	4948.32322048948
— I know.	528.4875105745994
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor.	7710.836278413572
The porter hoisted the valise up on the well.	6930.781252866125
She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change.	11518.697219562744
Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth.	16284.095518053378
Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets.	13515.30618725557
Like that haughty creature at the polo match.	10964.75098102374
Women all for caste till you touch the spot.	12550.489803162422
Handsome is and handsome does.	12429.07439281914
Reserved about to yield.	17934.151259061025
The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man.	7203.011455464251
Possess her once take the starch out of her.	8214.764773666462
— I was with Bob Doran, he ’ s on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons.	5890.015873584704
Just down there in Conway ’ s we were.	10759.395111792945
Doran Lyons in Conway ’ s.	6239.01556920869
She raised a gloved hand to her hair.	7173.726882557218
In came Hoppy.	6960.639023770248
Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums.	14988.78372983613
Clearly I can see today.	10670.064761267928
Moisture about gives long sight perhaps.	12949.01320505992
Talking of one thing or another.	9867.384913599699
Lady ’ s hand.	4749.183060180011
Which side will she get up?	10583.914719134047
— And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy? _ I said.	6451.524117175823
_Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.	3797.607521132572
High brown boots with laces dangling.	13840.111644043622
Wellturned foot.	13208.796798932159
What is he foostering over that change for?	6503.9580079971665
Sees me looking.	11746.43412029943
Eye out for other fellow always.	16703.75625017976
Good fallback.	8275.153022040167
Two strings to her bow.	9845.795729416179
— _Why? _ I said.	2676.880340603628
_What ’ s wrong with him? _ I said.	6789.5834261963555
Proud: rich: silk stockings.	13839.95466349412
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	361.3981324828253
He moved a little to the side of M ’ Coy ’ s talking head.	6002.76710430514
Getting up in a minute.	9068.285993511321
— _What ’ s wrong with him_?	6856.681010537056
He said.	779.1045528977273
_He ’ s dead_, he said.	3239.587200934495
And, faith, he filled up.	5192.338677184985
_Is it Paddy Dignam_?	17932.795356577266
I said.	744.5928285068793
I couldn ’ t believe it when I heard it.	3770.356907820628
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch.	7667.643149146469
_Yes, _ he said.	4174.088643758888
_He ’ s gone.	5975.105474302069
He died on Monday, poor fellow_.	8078.90971883093
Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white.	11102.42545698147
Watch! A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.	13359.720191433991
Lost it.	4836.521095654647
Curse your noisy pugnose.	15976.384944107931
Feels locked out of it.	4132.6619437642075
Paradise and the peri.	16797.37434320436
Always happening like that.	4388.284533844226
The very moment.	3028.5885011342034
Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter.	13742.529092242528
Her friend covering the display of.	8016.126014500095
_Esprit de corps_.	18227.54902377354
Well, what are you gaping at?	7356.931049427016
Another gone.	6712.887995001434
— One of the best, M ’ Coy said.	2162.825714701341
The tram passed.	4368.736585389197
They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip.	11797.571998049225
Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick.	15348.518578385336
— Wife well, I suppose?	4282.825360627995
M ’ Coy ’ s changed voice said.	4004.439796579157
— O, yes, Mr Bloom said.	658.7270161923682
Tiptop, thanks.	10358.900816768408
He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly: What is home without Plumtree ’ s Potted Meat?	9396.178513799154
Incomplete.	9728.691757493107
With it an abode of bliss.	6043.381039801138
— My missus has just got an engagement.	6462.293835286766
At least it ’ s not settled yet.	5246.9604616166225
Valise tack again.	8697.61211305569
By the way no harm.	4861.587758754617
I ’ m off that, thanks.	2382.9152093149623
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.	7339.776439361083
— My wife too, he said.	1386.509041414016
She ’ s going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.	8610.03652438198
— That so?	1158.5013331132407
M ’ Coy said.	1217.0170115856913
Glad to hear that, old man.	6636.733212222099
Who ’ s getting it up?	3844.2559795123857
Mrs Marion Bloom.	3221.0437041676205
Not up yet.	5852.016385341359
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.	14785.670737519607
No book.	3787.1790493012463
Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.	17279.93518182534
Dark lady and fair man.	9623.819327220619
Letter.	14336.178182593083
Cat furry black ball.	13956.868869797383
Torn strip of envelope.	13956.939245116948
Love ’ s Old Sweet Song Comes lo - ove ’ s old...	6187.310540319703
— It ’ s a kind of a tour, don ’ t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.	2253.880016870093
_Sweeeet song_.	18679.07077551165
There ’ s a committee formed.	3070.6026658762426
Part shares and part profits.	10985.405545545558
M ’ Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.	8816.756141153497
— O, well, he said.	692.1067553535454
That ’ s good news.	2702.400299832636
He moved to go.	3113.3691860648946
— Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said.	2385.631306763684
Meet you knocking around.	14932.412306617918
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	361.3981324828253
— Tell you what, M ’ Coy said.	2230.657526054201
You might put down my name at the funeral, will you?	6730.8618116557045
I ’ d like to go but I mightn ’ t be able, you see.	4174.976768456978
There ’ s a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found.	9113.734024613512
You just shove in my name if I ’ m not there, will you?	5672.203607885938
— I ’ ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off.	2232.9087263951665
That ’ ll be all right.	1305.7442491106706
— Right, M ’ Coy said brightly.	3319.520529155642
Thanks, old man.	4223.306702811303
I ’ d go if I possibly could.	4208.068994715539
Well, tolloll.	5506.616140094227
Just C.	4056.325274184764
P.	998.8985605994484
M ’ Coy will do.	3945.874928975197
— That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.	3963.9999438923182
Didn ’ t catch me napping that wheeze.	9962.749173501255
The quick touch.	4236.128531605051
Soft mark.	11484.279349821476
I ’ d like my job.	2571.13371463044
Valise I have a particular fancy for.	11965.075542753442
Leather.	19456.598729469286
Capped corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock.	17216.031693751804
Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this.	14211.652135954108
Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled.	5030.983394386257
My missus has just got an.	8716.107010089905
Reedy freckled soprano.	16807.8688531982
Cheeseparing nose.	11699.385526317174
Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad.	11840.922100813897
No guts in it.	2822.7514220461635
You and me, don ’ t you know: in the same boat.	4299.155565255509
Softsoaping.	19456.598729469286
Give you the needle that would.	8917.064960099593
Can ’ t he hear the difference?	6154.053645776771
Think he ’ s that way inclined a bit.	6660.1315099602225
Against my grain somehow.	14387.339559964454
Thought that Belfast would fetch him.	8537.728518698668
I hope that smallpox up there doesn ’ t get worse.	5897.587696051112
Suppose she wouldn ’ t let herself be vaccinated again.	6467.417046638502
Your wife and my wife.	8411.343393715075
Wonder is he pimping after me?	7599.612643723718
Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings.	7364.8436223500985
Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s Ginger Ale (Aromatic).	10795.34882691958
Clery ’ s Summer Sale.	16224.008400008235
No, he ’ s going on straight.	3256.5256803969087
Hello.	4086.330067868833
_Leah_ tonight.	12492.297669913078
Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	6805.090343625665
_Hamlet_ she played last night.	9913.607681384277
Male impersonator.	18679.07077551165
Perhaps he was a woman.	5070.525090408824
Why Ophelia committed suicide.	9495.175603444217
Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that.	8550.828695008697
Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.	10963.142252313937
Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.	14400.212572525934
And Ristori in Vienna.	6939.079598784372
What is this the right name is?	5330.08255691955
By Mosenthal it is.	3565.497632139321
No. The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.	8912.0824570435
Nathan ’ s voice! His son ’ s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father.	11348.712970902181
Poor papa! Poor man! I ’ m glad I didn ’ t go into the room to look at his face.	5965.3603739481505
That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.	7558.784092282172
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.	7861.829434919367
No use thinking of it any more.	6408.485617893977
Nosebag time.	7629.79017046616
Wish I hadn ’ t met that M ’ Coy fellow.	7580.881060696619
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth.	9805.152254312334
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss.	13033.607861122642
Their Eldorado.	9746.617166046197
Poor jugginses! Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags.	14702.166049948783
Too full for words.	5859.866291499506
Still they get their feed all right and their doss.	11887.280336345984
Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches.	17078.959278561113
Might be happy all the same that way.	5920.982839827026
Good poor brutes they look.	8725.61730705686
Still their neigh can be very irritating.	12030.472691219167
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried.	8096.861443439066
Might just walk into her here.	8322.235352178966
The lane is safer.	6549.046155587141
He passed the cabman ’ s shelter.	4887.2191632437
Curious the life of drifting cabbies.	13176.97439592224
All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.	11345.848498554013
_Voglio e non_.	13178.493844997925
Like to give them an odd cigarette.	9759.301911357876
Sociable.	19456.598729469286
Shout a few flying syllables as they pass.	14513.804601271839
He hummed: Là ci darem la mano La la lala la la.	10262.373039099619
He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall.	10361.96927012382
No - one.	1574.3027984372911
Meade ’ s timberyard.	14823.150181732739
Piled balks.	16878.573427268955
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone.	12999.999899793966
Not a sinner.	6392.675204173445
Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.	13851.83933125111
A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill.	11872.40886494997
Pity to disturb them.	7222.519157932621
Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.	10643.412309376467
Open it.	4067.1362726502853
And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame ’ s school.	9197.45138683326
She liked mignonette.	6983.769204948485
Mrs Ellis ’ s.	3001.5261426667107
And Mr?	4496.169258815002
He opened the letter within the newspaper.	7723.277803083477
A flower.	4005.1019589923953
I think it ’ s a.	2164.4117589943794
Not annoyed then?	6141.079550250039
What does she say?	4859.830588509785
Dear Henry I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.	9677.916151737134
I am sorry you did not like my last letter.	7197.899523059951
Why did you enclose the stamps?	8060.137361069857
I am awfully angry with you.	3010.4100919385323
I do wish I could punish you for that.	4810.405737316483
I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world.	4418.81196640433
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word?	10310.472463198295
I do wish I could do something for you.	4424.045032111955
Please tell me what you think of poor me.	7312.213405690233
I often think of the beautiful name you have.	5856.385988663041
Dear Henry, when will we meet?	11653.22582987467
I think of you so often you have no idea.	7357.638034435756
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you.	6686.226902795487
Please write me a long letter and tell me more.	11203.426029594255
Remember if you do not I will punish you.	8489.46020184115
So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.	9572.421650962826
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted.	13135.531790295958
Then I will tell you all.	3492.826066115545
Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache.	11965.90220633743
today.	8074.916920550916
and write _by return_ to your longing Martha P.	10960.04454544711
S.	1192.4711296144715
Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.	8440.530200075644
I want to know.	1570.0086452338292
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket.	10198.93777730885
They like it because no - one can hear.	6169.551335339911
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down.	8288.447277772093
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word.	9265.570271073499
Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don ’ t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha ’ s perfume.	13651.950505635701
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.	11290.918118422558
Weak joy opened his lips.	8451.450858659413
Changed since the first letter.	14089.18675170124
Wonder did she wrote it herself.	10146.412767010124
Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me, respectable character.	13397.145728660145
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.	11139.579556958814
Thank you: not having any.	12847.541610142704
Usual love scrimmage.	16807.8688531982
Then running round corners.	7691.617660990976
Bad as a row with Molly.	8855.363722295895
Cigar has a cooling effect.	14299.211879461069
Narcotic.	19456.598729469286
Go further next time.	5754.986952968455
Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.	10346.937747779424
Brutal, why not?	11240.636904208655
A bit at a time.	3503.448831865207
Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.	7590.963053703652
Common pin, eh?	8128.147675378077
He threw it on the road.	3496.3026973247584
Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together.	9611.000334896247
Queer the number of pins they always have.	10157.336674544888
No roses without thorns.	8559.348879233634
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head.	8967.232552475336
Those two sluts that night in the Coombe, linked together in the rain.	10716.951463624273
O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.	6139.675836203859
She didn ’ t know what to do To keep it up, To keep it up.	3467.867845729469
It?	4069.623800987504
Them.	16997.075953601572
Such a bad headache.	10673.805163772573
Has her roses probably.	9407.873562178644
Or sitting all day typing.	10855.96351586359
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves.	16054.114741946907
What perfume does your wife use.	4439.27508561131
Now could you make out a thing like that?	6059.15723432519
To keep it up.	1859.266187154294
Martha, Mary.	9233.347899974431
I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money.	8747.721534709377
He is sitting in their house, talking.	6547.35784601474
Mysterious.	16997.075953601572
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.	11361.42392536192
To keep it up.	1859.266187154294
Nice kind of evening feeling.	10907.829819140496
No more wandering about.	4733.179478741281
Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip.	12438.576060479423
Forget.	14336.178182593083
Tell about places you have been, strange customs.	13396.331817463853
The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown.	11654.34948797672
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches.	11672.076347100447
She listens with big dark soft eyes.	6879.085604024574
Tell her: more and more: all.	8407.327542967854
Then a sigh: silence.	6857.625967733922
Long long long rest.	9122.387978765368
Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road.	11937.29979716356
The shreds fluttered away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.	11405.231705653405
Henry Flower.	8806.530470111522
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way.	7583.762008816459
Simple bit of paper.	9838.163449218815
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland.	10899.798139086406
Shows you the money to be made out of porter.	12325.875298389221
Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day, they say.	8677.727683402234
Skin breeds lice or vermin.	15786.109314441857
A million pounds, wait a moment.	6006.42777333575
Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.	12930.021144975657
One and four into twenty: fifteen about.	8831.268612265518
Yes, exactly.	3896.496589176811
Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.	11267.397540095304
What am I saying barrels?	7384.650783745783
Gallons.	19456.598729469286
About a million barrels all the same.	7305.434817612994
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.	11953.081127400883
Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.	14832.59607769886
The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.	13557.33298592068
He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.	7818.824460379328
Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband.	12793.03041714817
Damn it.	3320.9284133633055
I might have tried to work M ’ Coy for a pass to Mullingar.	9236.672369754922
Same notice on the door.	6417.057460257528

Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee.	11082.922493089764
Prefer an ounce of opium.	16727.4985151238
Celestials.	19456.598729469286
Rank heresy for them.	7109.304639455726
Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum.	14466.053301659664
Taking it easy with hand under his cheek.	13001.604638349654
Not like Ecce Homo.	8572.63060502773
Crown of thorns and cross.	14820.693222644375
Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.	15877.293256618024
Chopsticks?	19456.598729469286
Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.	16671.27677130598
Sorry I didn ’ t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn ’ t.	10374.729256114762
He ’ s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he?	6718.524990700901
The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.	8745.683958114845
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening.	11079.917782114755
Still life.	3618.2376899652013
Lap it up like milk, I suppose.	9113.73068049495
The cold smell of sacred stone called him.	5287.75314291774
He trod the worn steps, pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.	11664.900871392843
Something going on: some sodality.	12949.698707012249
Pity so empty.	12182.59111938178
Nice discreet place to be next some girl.	11537.259938100871
Who is my neighbour?	7516.047216993499
Jammed by the hour to slow music.	13136.828488975676
That woman at midnight mass.	7876.6928582858445
Seventh heaven.	12492.203193407448
Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed.	14318.12240575855
A batch knelt at the altarrails.	8444.807770400867
The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands.	6788.379878428305
He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth.	11003.2322342808
Her hat and head sank.	9409.921677402808
Then the next one.	3068.981505357389
Her hat sank at once.	5831.585895011729
Then the next one: a small old woman.	7000.473572478212
The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time.	5580.188085502029
Latin.	14336.178182593083
The next one.	2681.1837309194134
Shut your eyes and open your mouth.	9226.395126869324
What?	572.8670519115202
_Corpus: _ body.	12652.043236892394
Corpse.	15443.024084639697
Good idea the Latin.	7177.093717674358
Stupefies them first.	10606.844285364768
They don ’ t seem to chew it: only swallow it down.	6482.030549222268
Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse.	14794.264599767142
Why the cannibals cotton to it.	4919.390135166249
He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, and seek their places.	9245.56685603538
He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper.	10630.307539532014
These pots we have to wear.	12289.459499330853
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads.	9454.618172749622
They were about him here and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs.	11264.851489963177
Something like those mazzoth: it ’ s that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.	9273.840229409716
Look at them.	3091.6548461310426
Now I bet it makes them feel happy.	10321.982558422804
Lollipop.	19456.598729469286
It does.	3335.796559228259
Yes, bread of angels it ’ s called.	5864.599207442533
There ’ s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel.	7403.988084741477
Hokypoky penny a lump.	15665.818686484965
Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim.	11458.939634950182
They do.	3082.9327802294983
I ’ m sure of that.	1201.4485344878378
Not so lonely.	6035.098819904966
In our confraternity.	7548.570859917291
Then come out a bit spreeish.	10447.30860833023
Let off steam.	9870.706736569753
Thing is if you really believe in it.	7994.558983267717
Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.	14349.666994006771
Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox.	12244.316053539786
Hence those snores.	15868.195079096857
Blind faith.	10036.894643374244
Safe in the arms of kingdom come.	9677.27495877579
Lulls all pain.	14632.365267766996
Wake this time next year.	12288.345540373137
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on.	10997.709026788534
Suppose he lost the pin of his.	6779.041976906539
He wouldn ’ t know what to do to.	2902.5959804630693
Bald spot behind.	8784.085483388826
Letters on his back: <URL>	14685.340957477165
I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is.	5083.872186161341
And the other one?	3481.7069092661286
Iron nails ran in.	9314.560435544476
Meet one Sunday after the rosary.	12965.81338769831
Do not deny my request.	9860.387124231544
Dusk and the light behind her.	10971.625745005882
She might be here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly.	10600.195507997401
Their character.	6228.0047581736135
That fellow that turned queen ’ s evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning.	10543.141039335673
This very church.	6720.293517976543
Peter Carey, yes.	5939.251354441883
No, Peter Claver I am thinking of.	6646.048439750608
Denis Carey.	13656.980144780464
And just imagine that.	3425.4065871729044
Wife and six children at home.	9945.948883747811
And plotting that murder all the time.	4064.873858996389
Those crawthumpers, now that ’ s a good name for them, there ’ s always something shiftylooking about them.	6395.597870982797
They ’ re not straight men of business either.	6565.6167232666385
O, no, she ’ s not here: the flower: no, no.	5162.026662023086
By the way, did I tear up that envelope?	8340.204278782356
Yes: under the bridge.	6162.817026421937
The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly.	10478.689914552893
Wine.	10940.661888558341
Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness ’ s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley ’ s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s ginger ale (aromatic).	13672.89573014063
Doesn ’ t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.	9036.345843416731
Cold comfort.	13656.980144780464
Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they ’ d have one old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink.	13001.924266407956
Queer the whole atmosphere of the.	9200.457404855306
Quite right.	3536.1863706354693
Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir.	6786.429152374004
Not going to be any music.	6633.88384940294
Pity.	7168.595020610842
Who has the organ here I wonder?	10345.70453113584
Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street.	11238.63348139734
Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat Mater_ of Rossini.	12543.117150759195
Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s sermon first.	7837.893257983479
Christ or Pilate?	14632.365267767023
Christ, but don ’ t keep us all night over it.	7170.671694275283
Music they wanted.	12442.103065253208
Footdrill stopped.	12198.1551269199
Could hear a pin drop.	11838.645300573682
I told her to pitch her voice against that corner.	6614.923441404105
I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up: _Quis est <URL> Some of that old sacred music splendid.	10615.981229284365
Mercadante: seven last words.	10841.313942903891
Mozart ’ s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that.	10879.943465852957
Those old popes keen on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds.	14502.480044401773
They had a gay old time while it lasted.	10564.322495996159
Healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs.	16639.225585290103
Benedictine.	19456.598729469286
Green Chartreuse.	12825.524320071201
Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.	11907.678397808746
What kind of voice is it?	4226.617960637151
Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.	10413.725894107702
Connoisseurs.	19456.598729469286
Suppose they wouldn ’ t feel anything after.	7325.530122710734
Kind of a placid.	11151.097737280708
No worry.	5565.848880227834
Fall into flesh, don ’ t they?	5808.4618815491895
Gluttons, tall, long legs.	14369.375164003353
Who knows?	4506.003864131902
One way out of it.	2352.440650340816
He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people.	9770.170282304993
All crossed themselves and stood up.	5427.7410219960475
Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats.	8457.830345010021
Stand up at the gospel of course.	7865.174165087754
Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench.	11197.757591542422
The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin.	8905.044772817071
Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card: — O God, our refuge and our strength...	6961.5139734898785
Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words.	5481.534633109678
English.	14336.178182593083
Throw them the bone.	12681.360155712846
I remember slightly.	3611.142697466424
How long since your last mass?	9884.582793896907

Punish me, please.	10096.027044571701
Great weapon in their hands.	8091.303884810355
More than doctor or solicitor.	13056.812122290823

And I schschschschschsch.	5507.3280264975565
And did you chachachachacha?	7424.886428344398
And why did you?	3701.6502486946747
Whispering gallery walls have ears.	11729.743680401707

Monasteries and convents.	16807.8688531982
No browbeating him.	3037.893701266042
He had his answer pat for everything.	6620.421883650673
The doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.	6681.968439538666
The priest prayed: — Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict.	9155.582550648049
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.	13729.50333338823
The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off.	6151.7738666079185
All over.	3315.3883310624415
The women remained behind: thanksgiving.	8254.552634690217
Brother Buzz.	15707.401234162855
Come around with the plate perhaps.	8715.145062618612
Pay your Easter duty.	13044.860982597318
He stood up.	1203.5173054390814
Hello.	4086.330067868833
Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time?	9380.743632961652
Women enjoy it.	4747.808282838268
Never tell you.	3266.0245360920035
But we.	3761.4202640139492
Excuse, miss, there ’ s a (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff.	9376.77913924315
Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.	11918.640333077861
Glimpses of the moon.	7979.211112298181
Annoyed if you don ’ t.	4118.453527936668
Why didn ’ t you tell me before.	4559.696405855434
Still like you better untidy.	10986.533564486597
Good job it wasn ’ t farther south.	7607.916768706937
He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into the light.	8869.302757108095
He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water.	11962.547110540152
Trams: a car of Prescott ’ s dyeworks: a widow in her weeds.	14721.081077846857
Notice because I ’ m in mourning myself.	8222.184000584472
He covered himself.	3252.1808260160974
How goes the time?	5860.598102001611
Quarter past.	11288.150553374058
Time enough yet.	6257.260565967958
Better get that lotion made up.	7368.298053771608
Ah yes, the last time.	4358.860598493281
Sweny ’ s in Lincoln place.	8454.619689557598

He walked southward along Westland row.	5557.0264663923645
But the recipe is in the other trousers.	5667.962261896464
O, and I forgot that latchkey too.	4126.897876150176
Bore this funeral affair.	13956.728152149795
O well, poor fellow, it ’ s not his fault.	5506.148564970777
When was it I got it made up last?	12123.964914123258
Wait.	1316.9653973396455
I changed a sovereign I remember.	5956.537785177721
First of the month it must have been or the second.	8465.270038413055
O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.	5577.829865957336

— About a fortnight ago, sir?	4724.708077937592
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	361.3981324828253
He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs.	12710.480420066897
Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains.	13949.122065598605
— Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then orangeflower water...	3900.948852371559
It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.	10991.789225452154
— And white wax also, he said.	1616.6435969420427
Brings out the darkness of her eyes.	9218.61203518772

Feel fresh then all the day.	7087.086519568679
Funeral be rather glum.	15976.384944107931
That was two and nine.	4194.146340685878
Have you brought a bottle?	8489.707940641516
— No, Mr Bloom said.	477.376932156713
Make it up, please.	7087.176061365011
I ’ ll call later in the day and I ’ ll take one of these soaps.	5062.573063099021
— Fourpence, sir.	1699.495143877583
Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils.	5886.369350101353
Sweet lemony wax.	12351.709223377427
— I ’ ll take this one, he said.	948.0263673092315
That makes three and a penny.	7271.117879719194
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	1286.5461716601487
You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.	6159.932855526174
— Good, Mr Bloom said.	768.8120448156518
He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.	7586.129281726574
At his armpit Bantam Lyons ’ voice and hand said: — Hello, Bloom.	7526.130068679098
What ’ s the best news?	1929.108350181137
Is that today ’ s?	6272.376211309762
Show us a minute.	8991.685208156432
Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip.	16181.976403450453
He does look balmy.	5861.330577699862
Younger than I am.	10868.580332936157
Bantam Lyons ’ s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton.	14645.3233178943
Wants a wash too.	7720.910386024783
Take off the rough dirt.	12324.556238289237
Good morning, have you used Pears ’ soap?	9865.124373254164
Dandruff on his shoulders.	11428.091604124083
Scalp wants oiling.	18227.54902377354
— I want to see about that French horse that ’ s running today, Bantam Lyons said.	4586.735822663923
Where the bugger is it?	3658.8816992529014
He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.	10273.914722987973
Barber ’ s itch.	18154.394097731547
Tight collar he ’ ll lose his hair.	9358.528766836369
Better leave him the paper and get shut of him.	6810.79662098652
— You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.	1363.201027150425
— Ascot.	3451.237535283804
Gold cup.	6691.617328989866
Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered.	9264.623824472656
Half a mo.	11952.710086240364
Maximum the second.	10915.39415464845
— I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.	1661.9936650782133
Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.	13163.473560675997
— What ’ s that?	636.9127384647712
his sharp voice said.	6453.329099524227
— I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered.	3338.095257701374
I was going to throw it away that moment.	4105.370192260033
Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom ’ s arms.	10749.628393878682
— I ’ ll risk it, he said.	878.1632465743795
Here, thanks.	4640.731060026064
He sped off towards Conway ’ s corner.	5750.093014959222
God speed scut.	8848.744512180672
Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it, smiling.	9186.68145792393
Silly lips of that chap.	11367.167420351605

They never come back.	3828.1810671544927
Fleshpots of Egypt.	16808.98733064568
He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths.	8472.259201759678
Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets.	14860.143490682873
He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot.	11629.367390341125
Damn bad ad.	10226.112263048819
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.	10948.739050757784
Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.	10497.44487425594
Something to catch the eye.	6103.290998951118
There ’ s Hornblower standing at the porter ’ s lodge.	6314.456867015786
Keep him on hands: might take a turn in there on the nod.	11802.337891715977
How do you do, Mr Hornblower?	4930.1313629932065
How do you do, sir?	2382.735544538606
Heavenly weather really.	13492.86464334258
If life was always like that.	4700.053662309137
Cricket weather.	14855.255256694074
Sit around under sunshades.	13602.859108471028
Over after over.	7851.6232851648165
Out.	5690.29118711202
They can ’ t play it here.	3972.2549082824085
Duck for six wickets.	17932.704941932887
Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg.	11959.927722381097
Donnybrook fair more in their line.	13844.503235030092
And the skulls we were acracking when M ’ Carthy took the floor.	7221.449769087158
Heatwave.	19456.598729469286
Won ’ t last.	7877.90506131702
Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.	9305.355682945847
Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream.	15788.076947661619
This is my body.	6216.576729065514
He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.	12429.36099693684
He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.	13954.182893517467
Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.	8874.147230837485
— Come on, Simon.	1819.9743044857328
— After you, Mr Bloom said.	1047.3816987296334
Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying: — Yes, yes.	4962.264990421272
— Are we all here now?	4120.873269850044
Martin Cunningham asked.	2473.7452163675684
Come along, Bloom.	3961.7618564545583
Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place.	6412.22506145022
He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight.	9747.685008708211
He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue.	10799.559186655832
One dragged aside: an old woman peeping.	10186.791669117414
Thanking her stars she was passed over.	12353.173208087592
Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.	14790.807824417861
Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming.	12055.502268802056
Job seems to suit them.	10230.649750973747
Huggermugger in corners.	15175.77165039559
Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he ’ d wake.	12147.809390972609
Then getting it ready.	7112.2048807764095
Laying it out.	7367.550116296142
Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed.	6996.1626190404995
Pull it more to your side.	12287.602211539384
Our windingsheet.	7918.020518951411
Never know who will touch you dead.	8166.364968473066
Wash and shampoo.	18227.54902377354
I believe they clip the nails and the hair.	7162.259118823435
Keep a bit in an envelope.	9648.144846276955
Grows all the same after.	9329.793043168025
Unclean job.	11935.765987958663
All waited.	4047.2102835209544
Nothing was said.	4224.190419957433
Stowing in the wreaths probably.	13800.068503634388
I am sitting on something hard.	5325.1802057650975
Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket.	8431.081922024952
Better shift it out of that.	3620.492694745922
Wait for an opportunity.	9259.472040270806
All waited.	4047.2102835209544
Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses ’ hoofs.	12859.01230345936
A jolt.	4762.787687825449
Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.	12672.11450138207
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind.	11521.560363617198
The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.	10874.429620300956
At walking pace.	8151.700420356935
They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks.	13187.324369634014
Tritonville road.	11107.985707101476
Quicker.	16997.075953601572
The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.	12374.602985149553
— What way is he taking us?	5056.564701172211
Mr Power asked through both windows.	6615.305291963749
— Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said.	1380.9733846743095
Ringsend.	16997.075953601572
Brunswick street.	7888.436480873229
Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.	3864.05857714158
— That ’ s a fine old custom, he said.	1175.1474714673811
I am glad to see it has not died out.	5408.305237390737
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.	12672.675016438861
Respect.	16997.075953601572
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane.	9108.791408585865
Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.	8776.710261808297
— There ’ s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.	2219.106342939919
— Who is that?	1231.4438951822349
— Your son and heir.	5924.793000779365
— Where is he?	1631.1790872682786
Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.	3855.674489502371
The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.	11905.573193104547
Mr Dedalus fell back, saying: — Was that Mulligan cad with him?	7267.129675417458
His _fidus Achates_! — No, Mr Bloom said.	2338.5543451985573
— Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa ’ s little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.	8682.828109345544
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road.	5148.1950859050885
Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.	14195.535305931155
Richie Goulding and the legal bag.	12263.879662014728
Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm.	10244.08388747059
His jokes are getting a bit damp.	9071.240198256082
Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady ’ s two hats pinned on his head.	12300.13123131736
Out on the rampage all night.	7943.474028442553
Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear.	14347.705139159627
Wife ironing his back.	7078.479575850573
Thinks he ’ ll cure it with pills.	12395.799637808932
All breadcrumbs they are.	4734.342878644509
About six hundred per cent profit.	14199.30478229114
— He ’ s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.	3838.108896525805
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts.	12069.398905814385
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I ’ ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.	11347.141197839417
I ’ ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.	3478.5315440740987
He cried above the clatter of the wheels: — I won ’ t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son.	8416.793514498278
A counterjumper ’ s son.	3724.0901780751133
Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M ’ Swiney ’ s.	10102.305822297816
Not likely.	5276.151582411761
He ceased.	3301.1346391656302
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power ’ s mild face and Martin Cunningham ’ s eyes and beard, gravely shaking.	9534.044538534366
Noisy selfwilled man.	9656.270819218389
Full of his son.	7544.470803923027
He is right.	1489.0593385679522
Something to hand on.	6002.68188062422
If little Rudy had lived.	8698.47460481775
See him grow up.	5504.528920072181
Hear his voice in the house.	7089.483529740513
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit.	12101.98806056098
My son.	3980.9340416532145
Me in his eyes.	4446.15542209468
Strange feeling it would be.	8069.251995194986
From me.	2874.2807073686777
Just a chance.	5204.229573993158
Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil.	11638.417372668122
And the sergeant grinning up.	3182.747373907409
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched.	9931.867190222447
Give us a touch, Poldy.	8297.887628062896
God, I ’ m dying for it.	2482.634684721929
How life begins.	8340.486826694168
Got big then.	6207.057171417787
Had to refuse the Greystones concert.	11700.798550322024
My son inside her.	4913.361218366848
I could have helped him on in life.	4427.956576311893
I could.	1558.8819799837145
Make him independent.	12536.59967341891
Learn German too.	6876.8019990123175
— Are we late?	3806.408740602524
Mr Power asked.	2137.352612831261
— Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.	4780.239928829329
Molly.	4150.359356161469
Milly.	7586.596070254145
Same thing watered down.	7357.303790126925
Her tomboy oaths.	8833.109756411148
O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she ’ s a dear girl.	8665.707817129689
Soon be a woman.	7685.676772793571
Mullingar.	8498.96645492669
Dearest Papli.	15251.62811167228
Young student.	5850.046673331947
Yes, yes: a woman too.	3462.3145936061333
Life, life.	6280.72348770547
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.	9168.0079568889
— Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.	5143.0730991841165
— He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn ’ t that squint troubling him.	3401.4066652438264
Do you follow me?	2916.178806023505
He closed his left eye.	3816.34535254497
Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.	10176.190921592908
— What is this, he said, in the name of God?	2151.7286190621626
Crumbs?	16997.075953601572
— Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.	5422.157859165135
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats.	13002.688316319065
Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said: — Unless I ’ m greatly mistaken.	7378.465222456901
What do you think, Martin?	4185.404261319705
— It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.	2042.045015492368
Mr Bloom set his thigh down.	4245.184266560301
Glad I took that bath.	11257.744642991574
Feel my feet quite clean.	10828.746472658213
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.	8662.441751941782
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.	4827.506834779356
— After all, he said, it ’ s the most natural thing in the world.	2340.8318160555223
— Did Tom Kernan turn up?	4830.520174902113
Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.	8079.558844357108
— Yes, Mr Bloom answered.	972.9355454276617
He ’ s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.	4433.345480190283
— And Corny Kelleher himself?	3625.710945698074
— At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.	2178.7471191103737
— I met M ’ Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said.	1881.7165499273074
He said he ’ d try to come.	3870.186924173158
The carriage halted short.	4391.740671296399
— What ’ s wrong?	1535.9012939656334
— We ’ re stopped.	2328.907365336165
— Where are we?	3036.401492895515
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.	3309.9557189532434
— The grand canal, he said.	1220.236142956184
Whooping cough they say it cures.	16114.852839583984
Good job Milly never got it.	5951.073156349025
Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions.	12684.741469322966
Shame really.	10785.10055211
Only measles.	9935.810101976167
Flaxseed tea.	12492.203193407448
Scarlatina, influenza epidemics.	17932.61452774436
Canvassing for death.	11390.573202333171
Don ’ t miss this chance.	5422.617260654706
Dogs ’ home over there.	7878.652447047947
Thy will be done.	10507.073525991715
We obey them in the grave.	6249.206622527362
A dying scrawl.	6108.478345590255
He took it to heart, pined away.	6017.7500224831065
Quiet brute.	15251.62811167228
Old men ’ s dogs usually are.	7877.821078265604
A raindrop spat on his hat.	4734.19477419523
He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags.	11095.76388223062
Apart.	19456.598729469286
Curious.	12257.630687766508
Like through a colander.	10490.491973223794
I thought it would.	3164.1882458870064
My boots were creaking I remember now.	7627.409298632752
— The weather is changing, he said quietly.	3537.26102752825
— A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.	3470.5883105448556
— Wanted for the country, Mr Power said.	2918.136066986613
There ’ s the sun again coming out.	2973.8393009301944
Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.	10088.976277757249
— We ’ re off again.	2318.6637694268
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.	8913.954783562736
— Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.	3020.6035266933395
And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.	6574.694704798368
— O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly.	4250.450692962364
Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard ’ s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.	9652.680547763877
— Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously.	4324.113124656458
_His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my <URL> — Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing.	11492.50104110332
And the retrospective arrangement.	3905.7244799685827
— Did you read Dan Dawson ’ s speech?	5672.721690066752
Martin Cunningham asked.	2473.7452163675684
— I did not then, Mr Dedalus said.	1539.133893496337
Where is it?	1629.2941901667193
— In the paper this morning.	3181.522141995848
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket.	5745.472404105634
That book I must change for her.	5401.364246204493
Later on please.	12352.157492577991
Mr Bloom ’ s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that?	8541.492370775766
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne ’ s?	13699.751849079665
no, Sexton, Urbright.	17726.558083188873
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.	13978.504631533113
Thanks to the Little Flower.	11502.172098229934
Sadly missed.	15707.401234162882
To the inexpressible grief of his.	6524.172660362855
Aged <NUM> after a long and tedious illness.	17360.34436972483
Month ’ s mind: Quinlan.	15032.944551927665
On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.	11778.013852525852
It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high.	12640.030595462347
I tore up the envelope?	7314.188718925616
Yes.	804.865728120872
Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath?	8701.822962782728
He patted his waistcoatpocket.	6579.087956058839
There all right.	2546.339001746347
Dear Henry fled.	11233.799595459526
Before my patience are exhausted.	11341.431870071207
National school.	11935.495269171357
Meade ’ s yard.	9439.318188009676
The hazard.	3725.095356282331
Only two there now.	5144.784839231235
Nodding.	19456.598729469286
Full as a tick.	13964.809571390762
Too much bone in their skulls.	10047.828551014956
The other trotting round with a fare.	7219.466689445925
An hour ago I was passing there.	7088.063822057066
The jarvies raised their hats.	6558.059414769439
A pointsman ’ s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom ’ s window.	8063.595853853062
Couldn ’ t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier?	10935.044132197105
Well but that fellow would lose his job then?	10173.64171346545
Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?	12973.594881356634
Antient concert rooms.	15868.195079096857
Nothing on there.	5558.411185576712
A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet.	8236.009682968492
Not much grief there.	4657.011072786818
Quarter mourning.	12825.330371560145
People in law perhaps.	9290.848339351276
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark ’ s, under the railway bridge, past the Queen ’ s theatre: in silence.	8654.393286347766
Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	12485.394371932702
Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I wonder.	10973.906825872362
I said I.	2074.773505959834
Or the _Lily of Killarney_?	9076.767990689108
Elster Grimes Opera Company.	17932.704941932887
Big powerful change.	9361.524642940572
Wet bright bills for next week.	14895.110545162177
_Fun on the Bristol_.	17988.060839863898
Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety.	10134.01329984881
Have to stand a drink or two.	8901.080814639763
As broad as it ’ s long.	5937.494180513651
He ’ s coming in the afternoon.	3589.4799635669387
Her songs.	6824.446401506298
Plasto ’ s.	3994.400845486658
Sir Philip Crampton ’ s memorial fountain bust.	13056.575802372716
Who was he?	3957.3048078788374
— How do you do?	1593.3586320808959
Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.	7196.25819305298
— He doesn ’ t see us, Mr Power said.	1909.9217274898808
Yes, he does.	2747.180051586823
How do you do?	2283.65664430685
— Who?	651.1040733368873
Mr Dedalus asked.	1246.069041670398
— Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said.	1959.8809076077582
There he is airing his quiff.	6593.118586004582
Just that moment I was thinking.	7879.047012783601
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute.	6242.291607251009
From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.	10052.293022976997
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand.	7245.196329101995
The nails, yes.	2786.9164423883926
Is there anything more in him that they she sees?	12820.375541032901
Fascination.	19456.598729469286
Worst man in Dublin.	8404.972925363889
That keeps him alive.	6201.826471220456
They sometimes feel what a person is.	7039.666363590244
Instinct.	12971.327416137423
But a type like that.	3232.1912824451965
My nails.	6415.911826680588
I am just looking at them: well pared.	6990.492714582674
And after: thinking alone.	5770.226823827107
Body getting a bit softy.	14546.115381956553
I would notice that: from remembering.	8281.805193684324
I suppose the skin can ’ t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off.	7501.729714182696
But the shape is there.	3507.2097319872905
The shape is there still.	5042.19332810482
Shoulders.	19456.598729469286
Hips.	19456.598729469286
Plump.	19456.598729469286
Night of the dance dressing.	12437.699892975012
Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.	13778.952443598413
He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.	10926.001883186347
Mr Power asked: — How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?	7995.369819634172
— O, very well, Mr Bloom said.	1278.021278812144
I hear great accounts of it.	2730.108124407121
It ’ s a good idea, you see...	1395.6691847732322
— Are you going yourself?	2541.597737880353
— Well no, Mr Bloom said.	1037.916488522846
In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business.	9568.056069061488
You see the idea is to tour the chief towns.	10376.291425426858
What you lose on one you can make up on the other.	6646.089754983896
— Quite so, Martin Cunningham said.	1501.953586278738
Mary Anderson is up there now.	8422.548809729182
Have you good artists?	7597.398774208218
— Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said.	2567.4899684878787
O yes, we ’ ll have all topnobbers.	6608.818726006059
J.	306.21619418874246
C.	957.8630399978279
Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and.	14767.77434875203
The best, in fact.	3486.0751129531436
— And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling.	3267.9706614772567
Last but not least.	10092.214897168726
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them.	7357.822229001079
Smith O ’ Brien.	11632.58223574013
Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.	9136.176126845361
Woman.	6654.801220995719
Must be his deathday.	6560.0089793443785
For many happy returns.	8327.020479069093
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.	16952.01024462224
— Four bootlaces for a penny.	4910.528855659877
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls.	12497.103562932192
Had his office in Hume street.	8414.975679768126
Same house as Molly ’ s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.	13685.502640332761
Has that silk hat ever since.	12880.502979758545
Relics of old decency.	17934.151259061025
Mourning too.	6275.288440716109
Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.	13768.967352204521
O ’ Callaghan on his last legs.	6278.043391407367
Twenty past eleven.	10502.766057149049
Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.	12402.411863609092
Doing her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_.	12985.406248643663
No: _vorrei e non_.	7347.122517757945
Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split.	12289.899736258098
_Mi trema un poco il_.	16727.4985151238
Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone.	15421.851664526906
A thrush.	3270.152057280454
A throstle.	3513.98049838411
There is a word throstle that expresses that.	6007.426226453552
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power ’ s goodlooking face.	6646.195796597682
Greyish over the ears.	12441.169737763808
_Madame_: smiling.	13492.86464334258
I smiled back.	2740.7478512368925
A smile goes a long way.	5495.890002818157
Only politeness perhaps.	6750.328490044585
Nice fellow.	6712.887995001434
Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps?	11247.976295484885
Not pleasant for the wife.	6554.895200433073
Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal.	9976.715474710189
You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick.	9707.22407709619
Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak.	8510.50034098631
What is this she was?	3820.239083189164
Barmaid in Jury ’ s.	5993.372377020419
They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator ’ s form.	8770.892295556307
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.	6931.975667245598
— Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.	1862.3866105309658
A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery ’ s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.	11529.892454157722
— In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.	3152.488748104699
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly: — The devil break the hasp of your back! Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray ’ s statue.	12588.701374080363
— We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.	5305.25033584533
His eyes met Mr Bloom ’ s eyes.	3110.880041470429
He caressed his beard, adding: — Well, nearly all of us.	6702.901512714319
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions ’ faces.	8512.073151435154
— That ’ s an awfully good one that ’ s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.	5057.833346535898
— Yes.	427.3278064178512
Isn ’ t it awfully good?	5558.3617500635855
— What is that?	754.0821164494736
Mr Dedalus asked.	1246.069041670398
I didn ’ t hear it.	1509.8243082893007
— There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm ’ s way but when they were both.....	5106.298844585182
— What?	425.82801927876443
Mr Dedalus asked.	1246.069041670398
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?	4470.987780029016
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown.....	3524.3057280731464
— Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried.	5162.244887977209
I wish to Christ he did! Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.	10777.646322676203
— No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....	968.5514895761135
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely: — Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.	13207.211012105778
— For God ’ s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright.	7062.85953839256
Is he dead?	5925.21390081174
— Dead! Martin Cunningham cried.	4756.837371682873
Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive.	11943.743499276005
Half the town was there.	7040.140478436789
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	361.3981324828253
But the funny part is.....	1260.5812593411097
— And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son ’ s life.	6701.839219774548
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power ’ s hand.	5438.266289535385
— O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed.	3018.0861907508884
Like a hero.	6490.422592378639
A silver florin.	5632.710288770732
— Isn ’ t it awfully good?	3546.838256931058
Mr Bloom said eagerly.	1735.5531615218865
— One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.	4172.3474997434
Mr Power ’ s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.	7530.027900097037
Nelson ’ s pillar.	8841.061075847247
— Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny! — We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.	6320.532404774578
Mr Dedalus sighed.	3480.2287608240686
— Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn ’ t grudge us a laugh.	5832.761999161746
Many a good one he told himself.	8795.46135299838
— The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers.	6526.554968270412
Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I ’ d be driving after him like this.	9847.857259466
He ’ s gone from us.	1667.7536468277476
— As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said.	4414.3188449276495
He went very suddenly.	3961.2570746569563
— Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said.	1380.9733846743095
Heart.	9780.093555557632
He tapped his chest sadly.	6683.682694575196
Blazing face: redhot.	17932.88576347237
Too much John Barleycorn.	9103.019964241348
Cure for a red nose.	12092.271933404058
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite.	14937.223350772123
A lot of money he spent colouring it.	5784.59907508472
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.	9202.204180910905
— He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.	2362.1233787230617
— The best death, Mr Bloom said.	1302.9413319267885
Their wide open eyes looked at him.	6482.067572388534
— No suffering, he said.	976.6923051332925
A moment and all is over.	6326.554293396751
Like dying in sleep.	7273.554312068331
No - one spoke.	3828.1455928269897
Dead side of the street this.	8170.345121165883
Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer ’ s railway guide, civil service college, Gill ’ s, catholic club, the industrious blind.	14036.988657146549
Why?	1336.6418951783915
Some reason.	8462.623898213193
Sun or wind.	11746.505137760007
At night too.	3912.5852426965844
Chummies and slaveys.	16807.8688531982
Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew.	11430.974834334018
Foundation stone for Parnell.	15976.465490337667
Breakdown.	19456.598729469286
Heart.	9780.093555557632
White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping.	15570.8948447502
A tiny coffin flashed by.	5802.157639066934
In a hurry to bury.	7081.921297046031
A mourning coach.	5632.710288770732
Unmarried.	19456.598729469286
Black for the married.	11640.269455510857
Piebald for bachelors.	18227.659305286463
Dun for a nun.	17948.404282837815
— Sad, Martin Cunningham said.	1266.367754420924
A child.	2615.506147488942
A dwarf ’ s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy ’ s was.	7625.116522221164
Dwarf ’ s body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box.	13338.81650928492
Burial friendly society pays.	16760.897092969924

Beggar.	14336.178182593083
Baby.	19456.598729469286
Meant nothing.	10640.944770708618
Mistake of nature.	9233.236145543338
If it ’ s healthy it ’ s from the mother.	5788.154414972231
If not from the man.	5310.3465903565
Better luck next time.	5102.862608746107
— Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said.	2011.8913395758952
It ’ s well out of it.	1346.125266187583
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square.	7861.658792741998
Rattle his bones.	10258.061677157519
Over the stones.	7239.431173940444
Only a pauper.	8445.21953037682
Nobody owns.	10471.917594461911
— In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.	2042.8482026525355
— But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.	5523.6116493655945
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.	7700.267483438508
— The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.	5885.135413920871
— Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.	4638.642592751816
We must take a charitable view of it.	5114.102798235159
— They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.	3801.7624142087693
— It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.	2600.609656339937
Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again.	4817.9847299353205
Looking away now.	5698.246330168658
Sympathetic human man he is.	7113.580815666493
Intelligent.	19456.598729469286
Like Shakespeare ’ s face.	3443.419767731632
Always a good word to say.	6801.531435599258
They have no mercy on that here or infanticide.	9559.281972209847
Refuse christian burial.	18227.54902377354
They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave.	9744.293491761784
Yet sometimes they repent too late.	11811.294686182622
Found in the riverbed clutching rushes.	15391.793891612513
He looked at me.	1538.672210204772
And that awful drunkard of a wife of his.	6717.525878948087
Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost.	16268.903923190634
Leading him the life of the damned.	13841.862297788148
Monday morning.	8807.195962599164
Start afresh.	18679.07077551165
Shoulder to the wheel.	13996.415794624858
Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there.	9855.512033005507
Drunk about the place and capering with Martin ’ s umbrella.	14332.127394262347
And they call me the jewel of Asia, Of Asia, The geisha.	9273.171311848377
He looked away from me.	2608.8366737100982
He knows.	2266.6600048452465
Rattle his bones.	10258.061677157519
That afternoon of the inquest.	9275.194862084349
The redlabelled bottle on the table.	3782.744284074043
The room in the hotel with hunting pictures.	7784.128497131891
Stuffy it was.	7599.750616886651
Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind.	15388.427982748588
The coroner ’ s sunlit ears, big and hairy.	10468.346843328094
Boots giving evidence.	16807.8688531982
Thought he was asleep first.	10078.976861901961
Then saw like yellow streaks on his face.	6377.466533028555
Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.	4945.8886138546895
Verdict: overdose.	18227.54902377354
Death by misadventure.	13492.701411031821
The letter.	2491.2721122350786
For my son Leopold.	6556.03140644219
No more pain.	4688.952734481005
Wake no more.	7047.008065165791
Nobody owns.	10471.917594461911
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street.	5029.840608632194
Over the stones.	7239.431173940444
— We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.	2926.3580477554547
— I hope not, Martin Cunningham said.	1329.957768254876
That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany.	8029.4065495029035
The Gordon Bennett.	4178.102711164507
— Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said.	1250.1831844466415
That will be worth seeing, faith.	5775.340643382965
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls.	14337.082897209646
Has anybody here seen Kelly?	11069.665660522485
Kay ee double ell wy.	14059.409198789604
Dead March from <URL> He ’ s as bad as old Antonio.	9181.795932304518
He left me on my ownio.	7874.841336017192
Pirouette! The _Mater Misericordiae_.	17726.634690540308
Eccles street.	6273.727257173335
My house down there.	4466.000509494985
Big place.	6032.859872966827
Ward for incurables there.	8678.995968716095
Deadhouse handy underneath.	18227.54902377354
Where old Mrs Riordan died.	8663.362291694957
They look terrible the women.	6792.982062571917
Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon.	11908.140975197077
Then the screen round her bed for her to die.	8494.829771527266
Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me.	10133.411786864672
He ’ s gone over to the lying - in hospital they told me.	3849.1222269454515
From one extreme to the other.	6089.616889997354
The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.	6043.105938359491
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups.	13538.414244804138
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.	14177.446493968439
— Emigrants, Mr Power said.	1683.3105803364583
— Huuuh! the drover ’ s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.	10176.016724569445
Huuuh! out of that! Thursday, of course.	8619.993084439311
Tomorrow is killing day.	10175.2309341455
Springers.	19456.598729469286
Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each.	16682.958428308004
For Liverpool probably.	6094.241206419378
Roastbeef for old England.	15976.626591325297
They buy up all the juicy ones.	7865.552306381035
And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns.	10286.082202026151
Comes to a big thing in a year.	13841.69296385627
Dead meat trade.	10999.55646289604
Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine.	17281.82030061503
Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.	12401.92112639961
The carriage moved on through the drove.	6833.575830240755
— I can ’ t make out why the corporation doesn ’ t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.	4469.0861539644675
All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.	10273.099203461952
— Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.	3588.2259689561765
Quite right.	3536.1863706354693
They ought to.	2652.7736804193573
Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all.	12179.317228523061
Don ’ t you see what I mean?	3577.8343486568037
— O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.	2427.823049341225
Pullman car and saloon diningroom.	17725.486085224285
— A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.	5192.270717881897
Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus.	4738.951396084858
Wouldn ’ t it be more decent than galloping two abreast?	9535.308502896263
— Well, there ’ s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.	3963.814155770413
— And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn ’ t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy ’ s and upset the coffin on to the road.	6204.146268994672
— That was terrible, Mr Power ’ s shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road.	5490.1147645783785
Gordon Bennett cup.	11473.031082206942
— Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.	6290.3294239433035
Bom! Upset.	18227.54902377354
A coffin bumped out on to the road.	5487.650056589861
Burst open.	9886.21982117981
Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him.	11099.289543373829
Red face: grey now.	8367.395889320287
Mouth fallen open.	9538.281912388278
Asking what ’ s up now.	6441.4481217871635
Quite right to close it.	6072.030693000112
Looks horrid open.	8612.136664123756
Then the insides decompose quickly.	6471.720846249593
Much better to close up all the orifices.	14714.227588403499
Yes, also.	3289.233524434426
With wax.	6249.499415855717
The sphincter loose.	5018.299809366881
Seal up all.	8604.224307073046
— Dunphy ’ s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.	5406.626664300042
Dunphy ’ s corner.	7752.750979230441
Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.	15553.11276945939
A pause by the wayside.	8127.164971338259
Tiptop position for a pub.	14308.519285461518
Expect we ’ ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health.	13767.93219743783
Pass round the consolation.	15980.329443005348
But suppose now it did happen.	8913.237068674163
Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about?	11647.153633179041
He would and he wouldn ’ t, I suppose.	4043.1778208358564
Depends on where.	13492.619789445018
The circulation stops.	5018.269448422289
Still some might ooze out of an artery.	11937.393851923758
It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.	9810.67140556227
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road.	8114.301141619071
An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.	13045.686277006502
Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.	14566.632697697627
Water rushed roaring through the sluices.	16118.744508007938
A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf.	9425.889732646136
On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse.	8580.84245140083
Aboard of the <URL> Their eyes watched him.	9940.770151077937
On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.	13708.516136921577
Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal.	16048.820904606115
Or cycle down.	5177.264873424016
Hire some old crock, safety.	16702.682722125228
Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady ’ s.	8065.187481373899
Developing waterways.	18679.07077551165
James M ’ Cann ’ s hobby to row me o ’ er the ferry.	13263.555175267189
Cheaper transit.	18679.07077551165
By easy stages.	9007.53051680912
Houseboats.	19456.598729469286
Camping out.	7920.113538541505
Also hearses.	9492.811190079472
To heaven by water.	6441.154340420319
Perhaps I will without writing.	10490.852926037513
Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla.	11653.295905367691
Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin.	12658.820151546404
With turf from the midland bogs.	11095.546329908673
Salute.	19456.598729469286
He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.	6431.404575238757
They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house.	7326.08505743148
Near it now.	4744.294159255005
— I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.	3750.3316158414727
— Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.	2147.9642227673016
— How is that?	1196.6629024372035
Martin Cunningham said.	785.6524662118408
Left him weeping, I suppose?	11025.644551453093
— Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.	5336.884845663294
The carriage steered left for Finglas road.	5856.272959471639
The stonecutter ’ s yard on the right.	4490.005658618788
Last lap.	8253.321630861312
Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing.	15082.141104006309
Fragments of shapes, hewn.	17724.949940336057
In white silence: appealing.	9443.104912195584
The best obtainable.	4530.979619996391
Thos.	19456.598729469286
H.	3260.787118728146
Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.	17570.648302713715
Passed.	19456.598729469286
On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton ’ s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot.	10781.950693243241
After life ’ s journey.	10654.832027523993
Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.	14057.738579842411
Mr Power pointed.	5039.055385105481
— That is where Childs was murdered, he said.	2244.4901527499187
The last house.	2418.557313540757
— So it is, Mr Dedalus said.	1517.1130518949474
A gruesome case.	4427.5151535207
Seymour Bushe got him off.	11878.406313759608
Murdered his brother.	12536.90304078859
Or so they said.	3338.1259919912386
— The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.	2701.005218487534
— Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added.	4295.568858609794
That ’ s the maxim of the law.	2484.097894507254
Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.	13166.029851492662
They looked.	3775.2923898342915
Murderer ’ s ground.	9439.50851698939
It passed darkly.	6573.626976382823
Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden.	14045.491509790772
Whole place gone to hell.	13723.166539193997
Wrongfully condemned.	15707.401234162855
Murder.	16997.075953601572
The murderer ’ s image in the eye of the murdered.	8905.877003610058
They love reading about it.	4003.9126073779253
Man ’ s head found in a garden.	9716.241750504805
Her clothing consisted of.	6738.365859983911
Recent outrage.	18679.07077551165
Murderer is still at large.	16054.322879835428
Clues.	19456.598729469286
A shoelace.	4762.787687825449
The body to be exhumed.	7063.7600361299765
Murder will out.	8460.8415631426
Cramped in this carriage.	15977.915021667764
She mightn ’ t like me to come that way without letting her know.	8688.88060108842
Must be careful about women.	5867.793266887643
Catch them once with their pants down.	11759.239641107479
Never forgive you after.	7613.777288210779
Fifteen.	9780.093555557632
The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze.	8931.113585797135
Dark poplars, rare white forms.	13096.508983256412
Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.	13131.552814260735
The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped.	7681.210475463847
Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee.	11437.919182231251
He stepped out.	2211.2574729653657
Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.	7217.175077656091
Change that soap now.	8384.50025068648
Mr Bloom ’ s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.	7092.4552977162
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.	8926.99565220906
Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages.	16683.1266456858
It ’ s all the same.	1342.2089465558868
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley.	17162.463601240073
Pomp of death.	9483.774574231238
Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit.	14855.963630883482
Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.	12401.52506607695
Dogbiscuits.	19456.598729469286
Who ate them?	5707.649709539323
Mourners coming out.	7802.233729195504
He followed his companions.	5747.44964639016
Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them.	7653.391934436276
Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths.	10815.737099426859
He handed one to the boy.	4629.745659515844
Where is that child ’ s funeral disappeared to?	7522.880402692591
A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block.	13639.547845857896
The waggoner marching at their head saluted.	7892.35102771474
Coffin now.	7101.5519197493
Got here before us, dead as he is.	7612.373771660384
Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways.	15079.703949086803
Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something.	12943.604926382925
Do they know what they cart out here every day?	11941.050643312115
Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day.	6565.603892957699
Then Mount Jerome for the protestants.	10454.961164680419
Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute.	11688.642568312467
Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.	16697.765997849132
Too many in the world.	3742.1029549511672
Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl.	11154.507749791288
Leanjawed harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry.	15248.225711576755
Girl ’ s face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman ’ s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.	11138.69135916075
The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates.	8827.916886184796
So much dead weight.	7648.539794501656
Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath.	11729.056443469744
First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff.	12364.932865359504
Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths.	11365.027799698786
Who is that beside them?	6146.8293955773
Ah, the brother - in - law.	4113.034189559954
All walked after.	5008.598637146451
Martin Cunningham whispered: — I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.	7562.245001384953
— What?	425.82801927876443
Mr Power whispered.	3439.5491098917632
How so?	3720.567345549563
— His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered.	6016.937157581078
Had the Queen ’ s hotel in Ennis.	8140.704509555015
You heard him say he was going to Clare.	8093.003581960725
Anniversary.	19456.598729469286
— O God! Mr Power whispered.	4043.9243401914973
First I heard of it.	3519.246211204073
Poisoned himself?	14193.45389360042
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal ’ s mausoleum.	11299.496592484686
Speaking.	15443.024084639697
— Was he insured?	4206.360628184281
Mr Bloom asked.	890.7170653928929
— I believe so, Mr Kernan answered.	3653.22455916665
But the policy was heavily mortgaged.	7444.934473078916
Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.	10727.576088491523
— How many children did he leave?	5741.280995298951
— Five.	3451.237535283804
— A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently.	3119.3973567889097
Five young children.	9915.770162763945
— A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.	6772.2556811009745
— Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.	4256.881407141154
Has the laugh at him now.	6679.2622832772595
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished.	7613.753572790298
She had outlived him.	2656.541604324263
Lost her husband.	13212.075815586306
More dead for her than for me.	7374.201291159623
One must outlive the other.	6050.539205213485
Wise men say.	8718.089523369536
There are more women than men in the world.	4935.293990815839
Condole with her.	7892.90280807059
Your terrible loss.	9296.615033651207
I hope you ’ ll soon follow him.	3453.6071393538127
For Hindu widows only.	8077.793717450095
She would marry another.	4525.168808331058
Him?	15443.024084639697
No. Yet who knows after.	5307.168588484498
Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died.	14866.922542222417
Drawn on a guncarriage.	17941.464304267578
Victoria and Albert.	18227.54902377354
Frogmore memorial mourning.	14632.365267766996
But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet.	10174.5589606055
Vain in her heart of hearts.	14050.743564437971
All for a shadow.	5194.7833125587385
Consort not even a king.	13494.598472356174
Her son was the substance.	10569.881779524392
Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting.	13136.373648521318
It never comes.	4593.995559728099
— How are you, Simon?	3689.0238719933927
Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands.	6749.0956775436625
Haven ’ t seen you for a month of Sundays.	12372.208110217545
— Never better.	2422.423651398495
How are all in Cork ’ s own town?	9004.079466568788
— I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said.	4404.165442730895
Same old six and eightpence.	12429.557726726154
Stopped with Dick Tivy.	14932.562870635753
— And how is Dick, the solid man?	5860.464816768817
— Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.	5678.329412543213
— By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder.	6492.4709595260865
Dick Tivy bald?	16807.970545269076
— Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead.	7620.600867370994
A few bob a skull.	4578.455648732504
Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.	9206.366976371932
— Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously.	1945.3018818939017
Is that the eldest boy in front?	9418.592260169506
— Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife ’ s brother.	2817.7249770389662
John Henry Menton is behind.	5359.207974791372
He put down his name for a quid.	6773.0386649151715
— I ’ ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said.	1382.2589389769282
I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job.	7857.2028833787
John Henry is not the worst in the world.	5547.3417608016225
— How did he lose it?	3244.0926058585824
Ned Lambert asked.	2802.6945636846804
Liquor, what?	8355.302712095423
— Many a good man ’ s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.	4936.74463216932
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel.	6412.46430437702
Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar.	10065.642987712823
Poor boy! Was he there when the father?	11653.152030346857
Both unconscious.	10571.668153790324
Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time.	8329.470672298638
All he might have done.	6511.626106206845
I owe three shillings to O ’ Grady.	9730.977518181357
Would he understand?	9880.910457625847
The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel.	8162.649523209399
Which end is his head?	12162.454826056113
After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.	11835.913991446227
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners.	11337.428416514176
Always in front of us.	5746.339353780845
Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel.	11717.115883195986
The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks.	6882.253646068812
Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it.	9234.245865547606
He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.	11108.950929535125
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door.	9509.244432652738
Who ’ ll read the book?	6960.812290257287
I, said the rook.	6252.164193233837
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.	10517.547720527624
Father Coffey.	8677.278164352938
I knew his name was like a coffin.	6607.312766052467
<URL> Bully about the muzzle he looks.	12852.306717955416
Bosses the show.	10284.01498829422
Muscular christian.	18679.07077551165
Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest.	15511.007883479466
Thou art Peter.	12903.856799372385
Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will.	14704.726748083056
With a belly on him like a poisoned pup.	7978.376257093302
Most amusing expressions that man finds.	14045.969466868983
Hhhn: burst sideways.	15976.304393411037
_ — Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, <URL> Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin.	11603.49469891377
Requiem mass.	14193.45389360042
Crape weepers.	18679.07077551165
Blackedged notepaper.	18679.07077551165
Your name on the altarlist.	10803.705923343548
Chilly place this.	12026.716026539883
Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please.	11443.593913827752
Eyes of a toad too.	8274.710449232041
What swells him up that way?	7380.645330516972
Molly gets swelled after cabbage.	10841.36079488403
Air of the place maybe.	15251.457055565415
Looks full up of bad gas.	12342.841616485475
Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place.	7966.682856675866
Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks.	14831.741260529521
Who was telling me?	3399.118307149287
Mervyn Browne.	18679.07077551165
Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh ’ s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it.	12684.233191058824
Out it rushes: blue.	11554.715074032547
One whiff of that and you ’ re a goner.	7343.524290255781
My kneecap is hurting me.	5807.066561248737
Ow. That ’ s better.	6616.74478602185
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy ’ s bucket and shook it over the coffin.	7170.121889979082
Then he walked to the other end and shook it again.	6746.648303033718
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket.	5384.53544056177
As you were before you rested.	10921.458644383853
It ’ s all written down: he has to do it.	3473.4992185532074
_ — Et ne nos inducas in <URL> The server piped the answers in the treble.	10696.860089255528
I often thought it would be better to have boy servants.	7308.022878117684
Up to fifteen or so.	8878.907937184975
After that, of course...	2267.9481619536273
Holy water that was, I expect.	12203.019454493588
Shaking sleep out of it.	4132.6619437642075
He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.	9603.705775786266
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over.	6828.49054999144
Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows ’ breasts.	15843.370572765576
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep.	11475.707001770845
On Dignam now.	4143.226998442011
_ — In <URL> Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise.	8552.285422087938
Says that over everybody.	14932.412306617945
Tiresome kind of a job.	8458.115946636906
But he has to say something.	5125.391135679148
The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.	8753.716202485179
Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart.	13346.447658424748
Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother - in - law.	8249.816638774553
All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air.	7748.4174780242665
Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket.	5971.484020780978
He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left.	8626.968190754988
The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.	13370.067249382888
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo.	9088.935876358437
Lord, I mustn ’ t lilt here.	7651.120219863025
— The O ’ Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.	2885.5206817001176
Mr Power ’ s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.	7893.300550221643
— He ’ s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O ’.	4089.6729805335267
But his heart is buried in Rome.	9546.720430145013
How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon! — Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said.	6978.370489596593
I ’ ll soon be stretched beside her.	2888.8836664577275
Let Him take me whenever He likes.	12412.398168383772
Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk.	14039.851000911096
Mr Power took his arm.	4751.567496105898
— She ’ s better where she is, he said kindly.	4022.963905371812
— I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp.	3615.9587451617103
I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven.	7452.285618210453
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.	11594.983194963332
— Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.	7390.094920553311
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.	5313.029787357212
— The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said.	4784.31858167988
I suppose we can do so too.	4841.9487199137275
We are the last.	3302.125510404504
This cemetery is a treacherous place.	8854.338739260884
They covered their heads.	6679.342734562696
— The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don ’ t you think?	4532.8013877243875
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes.	6526.541073885367
Mason, I think: not sure.	11068.432659237395
Beside him again.	6438.292009384969
We are the last.	3302.125510404504
In the same boat.	4322.603809660876
Hope he ’ ll say something else.	8068.708112691323
Mr Kernan added: — The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say.	9306.70701272191
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent.	5260.9770435124365
The language of course was another thing.	7032.503868301405
Mr Kernan said with solemnity: — _I am the resurrection and the life_.	10781.499427461387
That touches a man ’ s inmost heart.	5671.019899262817
— It does, Mr Bloom said.	1064.6824141203376
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies?	13581.782908317944
No touching that.	3406.8811955384513
Seat of the affections.	16889.070295090147
Broken heart.	9492.882943598554
A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day.	9029.694456407911
One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are.	9303.41448615942
Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers.	14936.511114967
Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else.	9323.253873222198
The resurrection and the life.	4463.376011083088
Once you are dead you are dead.	10063.252405187723
That last day idea.	6393.302335337366
Knocking them all up out of their graves.	12533.787835454074
Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job.	11618.603008187962
Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps.	12909.255442072286
Find damn all of himself that morning.	11569.338693692844
Pennyweight of powder in a skull.	13793.319209030156
Twelve grammes one pennyweight.	15976.304393411037
Troy measure.	18679.07077551165
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.	9371.507856521202
— Everything went off A<NUM>, he said.	2238.863524858372
What?	572.8670519115202
He looked on them from his drawling eye.	5399.5697788742145
Policeman ’ s shoulders.	8997.681968162773
With your tooraloom tooraloom.	8077.87517104487
— As it should be, Mr Kernan said.	3654.4379282894847
— What?	425.82801927876443
Corny Kelleher said.	2002.161251267325
Mr Kernan assured him.	2979.864490277823
John Henry Menton asked.	3374.2157135001526
I know his face.	1771.0335770688066
Ned Lambert glanced back.	5195.757393532965
— Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.	5956.886204953606
She ’ s his wife.	2222.1715121365164
— O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said.	2213.293374588516
I haven ’ t seen her for some time.	4599.284793249036
She was a finelooking woman.	4186.714153284643
I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon ’ s in Roundtown.	8812.284311562613
And a good armful she was.	4562.752127039444
He looked behind through the others.	4752.564235457498
— What is he?	983.0830413472677
he asked.	1146.2406223222367
What does he do?	4565.713640843389
Wasn ’ t he in the stationery line?	12819.767053197816
I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.	10075.434033977002
Ned Lambert smiled.	6015.03095758072
A traveller for blottingpaper.	6739.640825599325
— In God ’ s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for?	7004.257667337572
She had plenty of game in her then.	6081.37732367061
— Has still, Ned Lambert said.	2500.315634549286
He does some canvassing for ads.	6293.812658305998
John Henry Menton ’ s large eyes stared ahead.	7476.385733696597
The barrow turned into a side lane.	7054.04691684119
A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage.	11025.813045378054
The gravediggers touched their caps.	6188.98532449954
— John O ’ Connell, Mr Power said pleased.	4377.6952094640355
He never forgets a friend.	5147.751261858395
Mr O ’ Connell shook all their hands in silence.	5891.487699770162
Mr Dedalus said: — I am come to pay you another visit.	5481.2285733522085
— My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice.	7123.774685259793
I don ’ t want your custom at all.	2165.8253731763143
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham ’ s side puzzling two long keys at his back.	11968.400152013928
— Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?	7842.259361240375
— I did not, Martin Cunningham said.	1262.2565005524302
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear.	9796.259895396626
The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.	11975.217388827989
— They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs.	8558.685015575897
They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried.	11153.132306818574
After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough.	11550.913013920255
One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy.	9790.439955469938
The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.	9275.891267850811
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed.	7861.225033370544
He resumed: — And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like the man_, says he.	7883.831807204062
_That ’ s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.	8726.581398182436
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.	14875.345765947503
— That ’ s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.	4461.759482537418
— I know, Hynes said.	1029.5126905808515
I know that.	1303.7879410597425
— To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said.	2846.1733333381926
It ’ s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.	4893.7768643741
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker ’ s prosperous bulk.	7740.215668572276
All want to be on good terms with him.	5529.311241478943
Decent fellow, John O ’ Connell, real good sort.	10874.65132656538
Keys: like Keyes ’ s ad: no fear of anyone getting out.	12180.753552520866
No passout checks.	7503.861566893145
_Habeas corpus_.	18679.07077551165
I must see about that ad after the funeral.	6709.172024282509
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha?	13846.195913968859
Hope it ’ s not chucked in the dead letter office.	7014.201441323447
Be the better of a shave.	12710.544803761919
Grey sprouting beard.	13814.233320116737
That ’ s the first sign when the hairs come out grey.	5016.888569664323
And temper getting cross.	6025.334514843893
Silver threads among the grey.	14300.200253802434
Fancy being his wife.	9314.326711152933
Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl.	9946.409750802037
Come out and live in the graveyard.	11124.660647975456
Dangle that before her.	9548.951361223553
It might thrill her first.	5577.070639781743
Courting death.	10378.237707761551
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about.	13063.400139581863
The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O ’ Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark.	9693.250543319891
Will o ’ the wisp.	12507.0335670481
Gas of graves.	12903.778730445396
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all.	8263.180929092523
Women especially are so touchy.	13292.488406723178
Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep.	10890.10755439241
Have you ever seen a ghost?	8338.005024406712
Well, I have.	2475.2089339813074
It was a pitchdark night.	2945.9699765589853
The clock was on the stroke of twelve.	6754.22229102085
Still they ’ d kiss all right if properly keyed up.	8254.480183535661
Learn anything if taken young.	12756.888659187274
You might pick up a young widow here.	6787.789572344928
Men like that.	4238.341982103718
Love among the tombstones.	11854.611527799909
Romeo.	19456.598729469286
Spice of pleasure.	12738.59915078228
In the midst of death we are in life.	5518.928864894334
Both ends meet.	9624.512908307952
Tantalising for the poor dead.	12523.774150543151
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving.	15096.719115513803
Gnawing their vitals.	18227.54902377354
Desire to grig people.	12616.043640326236
Molly wanting to do it at the window.	7031.359961937297
Eight children he has anyway.	16730.533074121846
He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field.	9618.700997215841
Holy fields.	15251.62811167228
More room if they buried them standing.	13154.01384847925
Sitting or kneeling you couldn ’ t.	5752.813523455335
Standing?	16997.075953601572
His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing.	11386.309261541737
And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings.	11729.426888865622
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome.	10578.668473445749
Well, so it is.	2520.046023699656
Ought to be flowers of sleep.	8853.770529671056
Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me.	11126.809740784149
The Botanic Gardens are just over there.	5496.500456727815
It ’ s the blood sinking in the earth gives new life.	3824.63451718336
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.	12001.689100053994
Every man his price.	10403.121232087964
Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden.	11431.387215788769
A bargain.	4303.697045403607
By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six.	11655.959322019193
With thanks.	5102.887839396313
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails.	11582.670482990587
Charnelhouses.	19456.598729469286
Dreadful.	15443.024084639697
Turning green and pink decomposing.	15150.884077065266
Rot quick in damp earth.	13056.868548800143
The lean old ones tougher.	7475.122069939987
Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy.	6399.315647808154
Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them.	7734.533002880991
Then dried up.	3792.827453296979
Deathmoths.	19456.598729469286
Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living.	9377.280271256615
Changing about.	9492.882943598554
Live for ever practically.	14388.282428497609
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.	11213.15200075839
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots.	9269.855963869135
Soil must be simply swirling with them.	10881.71444114406
Your head it simply swurls.	6376.243984457645
Those pretty little seaside gurls.	12505.358783255644
He looks cheerful enough over it.	3620.4038657411293
Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first.	13513.580884817486
Wonder how he looks at life.	7303.923514843056
Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart.	12322.515441185236
The one about the bulletin.	6032.497244175075
Spurgeon went to heaven <NUM> <URL>. this morning.	10885.067104547385
<NUM> <URL>. (closing time).	7588.66544265077
Not arrived yet.	5852.016385341359
Peter.	11785.589583812412
The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what ’ s in fashion.	9664.577179090287
A juicy pear or ladies ’ punch, hot, strong and sweet.	11023.867414092874
Keep out the damp.	11080.812101300739
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.	7115.792587920645
Gravediggers in _Hamlet_.	16807.970545269076
Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart.	11443.855060747836
Daren ’ t joke about the dead for two years at least.	15849.701425899668
_De mortuis nil nisi prius_.	17724.87334026543
Go out of mourning first.	8880.761867431947
Hard to imagine his funeral.	10885.058240862392
Seems a sort of a joke.	9317.216969573014
Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer.	14685.286167900847
Gives you second wind.	12434.469980118545
New lease of life.	5989.835824325342
— How many have you for tomorrow?	5246.50553944079
the caretaker asked.	5549.749356790132
— Two, Corny Kelleher said.	2486.576117970384
Half ten and eleven.	9819.303968213557
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket.	4827.143976895266
The barrow had ceased to trundle.	7458.914912094185
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves.	9821.267261353047
The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.	8647.914704841669
Burying him.	5450.614124813626
We come to bury Cæsar.	10113.147895448028
His ides of March or June.	10004.699769031888
He doesn ’ t know who is here nor care.	4703.497679898562
Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh?	10499.572281605586
Now who is he I ’ d like to know?	6870.882418506083
Now I ’ d give a trifle to know who he is.	5434.784131936178
Always someone turns up you never dreamt of.	11066.016254059587
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life.	6827.678125234572
Yes, he could.	2694.157296677586
Still he ’ d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave.	10262.988152925036
We all do.	4937.230471387763
Only man buries.	11000.354645583897
No, ants too.	2722.3616667442006
First thing strikes anybody.	12026.020676764052
Bury the dead.	7817.610627601556
Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life.	9199.82909749225
Well then Friday buried him.	5462.6650558258125
Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.	7913.908028373927
O, poor Robinson Crusoe! How could you possibly do so?	8336.291037854326
Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box.	10949.544262675206
When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood.	9895.11676361608
All gnawed through.	6306.705518551006
They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way.	8688.378490511384
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow ’ s.	9106.0453119454
They ’ re so particular.	5800.20680228594
Lay me in my native earth.	10697.88059088085
Bit of clay from the holy land.	12506.950201362166
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin.	11118.690203193266
I see what it means.	4089.8723788082466
I see.	803.3839632815113
To protect him as long as possible even in the earth.	7609.3961551756975
The Irishman ’ s house is his coffin.	5540.461919690307
Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea.	14782.942121156162
Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.	6826.474272164993
Twelve.	15443.024084639697
I ’ m thirteen.	1549.7530424052595
No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.	6539.707559968404
Death ’ s number.	12588.061532625747
Where the deuce did he pop out of?	10454.209309765758
He wasn ’ t in the chapel, that I ’ ll swear.	6538.990272243599
Silly superstition that about thirteen.	12757.054027624597
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit.	12688.455180379826
Tinge of purple.	16807.970545269047
I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west.	6760.2678728075725
Dressy fellow he was once.	12866.374304086556
Used to change three suits in the day.	9148.93169926673
Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias.	11140.407290355026
Hello.	4086.330067868833
It ’ s dyed.	2522.1736372598652
His wife I forgot he ’ s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.	7235.229144428229
The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles.	10106.095653155935
They struggled up and out: and all uncovered.	11375.21797508915
Twenty.	12815.418782069682
Pause.	19456.598729469286
If we were all suddenly somebody else.	9191.739385173796
Far away a donkey brayed.	12429.289239138252
Rain.	11785.351918411056
No such ass.	6919.411981522894
Never see a dead one, they say.	5856.1408239280245
Shame of death.	8256.205199821481
They hide.	5908.339131105127
Also poor papa went away.	8665.837111642048
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper.	16284.73775782833
Whisper.	8384.101478745077
The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space.	10354.14494459188
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.	6920.5786616566065
Wellcut frockcoat.	16878.573427268955
Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.	15425.112462337887
Well, it is a long rest.	4408.19101520969
Feel no more.	5657.200027467742
It ’ s the moment you feel.	2414.3913597728374
Must be damned unpleasant.	5844.3330632344
Can ’ t believe it at first.	4842.658407916313
Mistake must be: someone else.	11767.32886376762
Try the house opposite.	11422.289047344588
Wait, I wanted to.	4587.007878548594
I haven ’ t yet.	3893.2457613279466
Then darkened deathchamber.	7927.740054552596
Light they want.	11234.2073694488
Whispering around you.	7124.494037854878
Would you like to see a priest?	7952.194649731972
Then rambling and wandering.	8960.410066068014
Delirium all you hid all your life.	12206.53307928559
His sleep is not natural.	8435.39172939212
Press his lower eyelid.	16760.981599493316
Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow.	16246.690078090302
Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he ’ s doomed.	11399.50661485988
Devil in that picture of sinner ’ s death showing him a woman.	11197.62219956567
Dying to embrace her in his shirt.	12860.647350144201
Shall I nevermore behold thee_?	16053.975985553223
Bam! He expires.	17935.777669032675
Gone at last.	9595.74982413399
People talk about you a bit: forget you.	9732.321099071156
Don ’ t forget to pray for him.	3425.826612448601
Remember him in your prayers.	12226.81125782428
Even Parnell.	9340.73602722234
Ivy day dying out.	10121.09977854919
Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.	8637.976486693085
We are praying now for the repose of his soul.	6284.556604847204
Hoping you ’ re well and not in hell.	11020.821074526011
Nice change of air.	7872.073453395934
Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.	12078.501264264158
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself?	11831.958461327471
They say you do when you shiver in the sun.	6114.742926576013
Someone walking over it.	4827.723705901033
Near you.	4220.882723078342
Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought.	15220.979513973178
Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.	15222.639328637108
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin.	9995.012338605278
Mr Bloom turned away his face.	2920.397422956565
And if he was alive all the time?	4771.921585423588
Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course.	9889.12878443521
Of course he is dead.	4615.6409613093065
Monday he died.	13083.620643299557
They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole.	11037.217219888364
Flag of distress.	18227.54902377354
Three days.	5763.0093495153815
Rather long to keep them in summer.	11843.231421793398
Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there ’ s no.	8526.053467318705
The clay fell softer.	6549.046155587141
Begin to be forgotten.	12368.950749050311
Out of sight, out of mind.	6896.4560461166
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat.	6164.419992691456
Had enough of it.	3364.278003624445
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show.	8064.640541715064
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves.	8667.332641277939
Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.	14958.021554545043
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook.	13684.735658831161
Ah, the names.	5014.01185974591
But he knows them all.	3274.8343039984943
No: coming to me.	3222.626821503251
— I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath.	5249.467679979891
What is your christian name?	4115.163901009814
I ’ m not sure.	1324.3851068031815
Leopold.	8073.777771455176
He asked me to.	2308.0661900811956
— Charley, Hynes said writing.	5281.559262424425
I know.	742.0041386124677
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.	10442.72450026091
Good idea a postmortem for doctors.	10429.46993181655
Find out what they imagine they know.	10853.411114004564
He died of a Tuesday.	6594.6525180818
Got the run.	8830.815850834544
Levanted with the cash of a few ads.	14966.240460701336
Charley, you ’ re my darling.	8690.720677971582
That was why he asked me to.	4060.256619291173
O well, does no harm.	7424.619727794491
I saw to that, M ’ Coy.	3738.1230033329557
Thanks, old chap: much obliged.	11240.429807287184
Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.	13308.232739616515
— And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the...	4858.478879078714
He looked around.	3037.064126398294
— Macintosh.	3451.237535283804
Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said.	1246.805051901794
Where is he now?	3435.579264716028
— M ’ Intosh, Hynes said scribbling.	5583.8625277627925
I don ’ t know who he is.	1310.7058853918381
Is that his name?	4314.473057928644
He moved away, looking about him.	4327.109865131804
— No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping.	3554.897562237264
I say, Hynes! Didn ’ t hear.	4566.973421613611
What?	572.8670519115202
Where has he disappeared to?	8357.666279651197
Not a sign.	4732.178916313447
Well of all the.	5773.11175387999
Has anybody here seen?	9677.737775343981
Kay ee double ell.	13685.422168597364
Become invisible.	15707.401234162855
Good Lord, what became of him?	8320.665169145354
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.	11550.756756796327
— O, excuse me! He stepped aside nimbly.	5330.839148824704
Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole.	13257.298890885337
It rose.	3552.103991857357
Nearly over.	8578.371511332107
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades.	10519.777780437937
All uncovered again for a few instants.	9258.138504745473
The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother - in - law his on a lump.	8340.473902254755
The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow.	10756.562868591183
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean.	10262.873075663367
One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass.	12923.072271302262
One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.	13642.340259776862
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.	16684.561891781676
His navelcord.	6055.98139396054
The brother - in - law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.	6924.014442106765
Thanks in silence.	7515.203165446359
Sorry, sir: trouble.	12958.841089372158
Headshake.	19456.598729469286
I know that.	1303.7879410597425
For yourselves just.	7591.371521003243
The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.	12113.65417151235
— Let us go round by the chief ’ s grave, Hynes said.	5541.952305364777
— Let us, Mr Power said.	1658.2519640763157
They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts.	7433.897892921784
With awe Mr Power ’ s blank voice spoke: — Some say he is not in that grave at all.	9609.625416102654
That the coffin was filled with stones.	7925.586191157928
That one day he will come again.	6006.427828680834
Hynes shook his head.	6287.321205652968
— Parnell will never come again, he said.	2521.4060022390813
He ’ s there, all that was mortal of him.	3198.393354047253
Peace to his ashes.	13965.510968784412
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland ’ s hearts and hands.	11354.199866208375
More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living.	13376.580296350136
Pray for the repose of the soul of.	7667.208617482249
Does anybody really?	12351.709223377427
Plant him and have done with him.	7355.7741503674
Like down a coalshoot.	10489.91037389947
Then lump them together to save time.	7381.590414586028
All souls ’ day.	5398.800886904672
Twentyseventh I ’ ll be at his grave.	7773.181290773147
Ten shillings for the gardener.	11892.456000272954
He keeps it free of weeds.	7873.591244340369
Old man himself.	6078.311909491021
Bent down double with his shears clipping.	17460.5804336232
Near death ’ s door.	7974.963994395551
Who passed away.	5153.948566107461
Who departed this life.	5372.880711623501
As if they did it of their own accord.	10667.798284047081
Got the shove, all of them.	5083.033721749558
Who kicked the bucket.	5434.088317417849
So and So, wheelwright.	9587.340757477397
I travelled for cork lino.	7748.154843518561
I paid five shillings in the pound.	7701.39165830839
Or a woman ’ s with her saucepan.	7165.6360241067405
I cooked good Irish stew.	7017.717523894894
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.	15167.780876008017
Entered into rest the protestants put it.	10339.789588095637
Old Dr Murren ’ s.	4203.066810916573
The great physician called him home.	6230.422459099177
Well it ’ s God ’ s acre for them.	4985.5942135395835
Nice country residence.	10606.267171286614
Newly plastered and painted.	17932.61452774436
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the _Church <URL> Marriage ads they never try to beautify.	15128.99557068134
Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil.	17280.03022417759
Better value that for the money.	7569.644045137185
Still, the flowers are more poetical.	9122.896525894806
The other gets rather tiresome, never withering.	8160.03633289122
Expresses nothing.	10640.944770708618
Immortelles.	19456.598729469286
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch.	10135.33843590401
Like stuffed.	8356.565255029953
Hoo! Not a budge out of him.	6420.149055774318
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him.	8861.633595035486
Dead animal even sadder.	13714.062609733974
Silly - Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.	13336.344642920261
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it.	5403.267638938467
Heart on his sleeve.	13612.85559459143
Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart.	10598.601954264803
Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that.	9663.632879725164
Seems anything but pleased.	12680.976575300305
Why this infliction?	8498.837790383894
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy.	11705.424159987839
Apollo that was.	7595.040184671023
How many! All these here once walked round Dublin.	9221.659405899087
Besides how could you remember everybody?	14560.753225058392
Eyes, walk, voice.	9156.319702987643
Well, the voice, yes: gramophone.	8230.913676726936
Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house.	7521.197839709202
Put on poor old greatgrandfather.	14298.59418957434
Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth.	17279.93518182534
Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face.	10450.282381298975
Otherwise you couldn ’ t remember the face after fifteen years, say.	8295.219193350857
For instance who?	6094.1306359131895
For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	4571.4768536345255
Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles.	15318.222278104255
Wait.	1316.9653973396455
Stop! He looked down intently into a stone crypt.	13863.020536328022
Some animal.	9615.251733152629
Wait.	1316.9653973396455
There he goes.	3395.1066838080105
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles.	10580.902927721092
An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes.	10946.700451662653
The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.	8615.91843729172
Good hidingplace for treasure.	10421.353401935503
Who lives there?	6189.822415939903
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery.	12782.14186952843
Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn ’ t he?	8935.157170276612
Making his rounds.	14632.365281156568
Tail gone now.	8408.708584417134
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow.	8246.313721708386
Pick the bones clean no matter who it was.	11190.656437599406
Ordinary meat for them.	7109.304639455726
A corpse is meat gone bad.	7092.238828538813
Well and what ’ s cheese?	8211.464217861538
Corpse of milk.	11746.647313679765
I read in that _Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse.	10791.574630790568
Cremation better.	11288.406558228835
Priests dead against it.	7642.75184968578
Devilling for the other firm.	14702.714542368232
Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers.	17570.71474456905
Time of the plague.	9752.039748763107
Quicklime feverpits to eat them.	10230.73814893592
Lethal chamber.	16878.573427268955
Ashes to ashes.	13492.783035582092
Or bury at sea.	6840.201815882208
Where is that Parsee tower of silence?	8574.476777120368
Eaten by birds.	13492.701411031798
Earth, fire, water.	11956.473464726914
Drowning they say is the pleasantest.	15100.558147972917
See your whole life in a flash.	11973.591926757652
But being brought back to life no.	7527.075846014744
Can ’ t bury in the air however.	5994.735837095818
Out of a flying machine.	10308.066666205894
Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down.	11638.96563006139
Underground communication.	18679.07077551165
We learned that from them.	5508.099310660161
Wouldn ’ t be surprised.	5813.9600927128995
Regular square feed for them.	7568.590181387454
Got wind of Dignam.	8734.156483111728
They wouldn ’ t care about the smell of it.	3373.2894237611226
Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.	17076.205771632725
The gates glimmered in front: still open.	7353.517963674029
Back to the world again.	8326.133037264104
Enough of this place.	9292.01904884858
Brings you a bit nearer every time.	9679.19164767025
Poor papa too.	3902.8402860108063
The love that kills.	6549.112193835997
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores.	13268.325051439551
Give you the creeps after a bit.	7737.174775342891
I will appear to you after death.	4860.891976610817
You will see my ghost after death.	5528.3672479894985
My ghost will haunt you after death.	7508.920152940778
There is another world after death named hell.	8912.9699257779
I do not like that other world she wrote.	5471.297071365714
No more do I.	3931.64336484186
Plenty to see and hear and feel yet.	13724.807512767235
Feel live warm beings near you.	8514.847223316374
Let them sleep in their maggoty beds.	10505.035997788069
They are not going to get me this innings.	6578.717361699652
Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.	10777.058337232187
Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.	9610.548475988893
Solicitor, I think.	6210.11190091997
I know his face.	1771.0335770688066
Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits.	11704.411499343174
Dignam used to be in his office.	6780.392461353125
Convivial evenings.	18679.07077551165
Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses.	13545.12073965291
Heart of gold really.	10587.627872575938
Yes, Menton.	4225.61499143732
Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him.	10709.340116491632
Pure fluke of mine: the bias.	15769.731569069942
Why he took such a rooted dislike to me.	6474.252399501664
Hate at first sight.	14387.992348006372
Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing.	10092.41280798217
Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.	10665.602052138804
Got a dinge in the side of his hat.	6663.695205922717
Carriage probably.	11935.856228920888
— Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.	2607.830805348945
They stopped.	3858.37379866651
— Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.	5344.755706247236
John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.	8199.428771750847
— There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.	4827.819470582185
John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve.	11353.206021389595
He clapped the hat on his head again.	4923.5776570249855
— It ’ s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.	1327.6830333640937
John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.	8950.785071585218
— Thank you, he said shortly.	2168.359279738581
They walked on towards the gates.	8379.509552744437
Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear.	7534.852537028212
Martin laying down the law.	8710.42781871245
Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.	10845.599770542663
Oyster eyes.	8442.603592640935
Never mind.	5313.082604906501
Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.	7915.448829386763
Get the pull over him that way.	7354.536301485043
Thank you.	2683.281056603683
How grand we are this morning! IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS Before Nelson ’ s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure, Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold ’ s Cross.	14489.579634639784
The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company ’ s timekeeper bawled them off: — Rathgar and Terenure! — Come on, Sandymount Green! Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.	13143.323784915994
— Start, Palmerston Park! THE WEARER OF THE CROWN Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and polished.	11296.738936938764
R., received loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.	15042.551271632328
GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince ’ s stores and bumped them up on the brewery float.	13326.239264184294
On the brewery float bumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince ’ s stores.	9959.022758032084
— There it is, Red Murray said.	3049.8674818757063
Alexander Keyes.	11287.979889286975
— Just cut it out, will you?	3801.1240251182267
Mr Bloom said, and I ’ ll take it round to the _Telegraph_ office.	3086.4923460279115
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office creaked again.	4745.078440267395
Davy Stephens, minute in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a roll of papers under his cape, a king ’ s courier.	13684.070120878547
Red Murray ’ s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes.	13856.387847848373
Scissors and paste.	16807.8688531982
— I ’ ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square.	3268.3758836582447
— Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind his ear, we can do him one.	8496.674450825692
— Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod.	3059.1409455507896
I ’ ll rub that in.	2103.44212541439
We. WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT Red Murray touched Mr Bloom ’ s arm with the shears and whispered: — Brayden.	11315.671652438556
Dullthudding Guinness ’ s barrels.	13636.463049388805
It passed statelily up the staircase, steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face.	9558.510972027212
The broadcloth back ascended each step: back.	6835.10499402958
All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalus says.	9481.706238060107
Welts of flesh behind on him.	7512.75319297186
Fat folds of neck, fat, neck, fat, neck.	12737.847075589816
— Don ’ t you think his face is like Our Saviour?	5168.404500326003
Red Murray whispered.	10226.236032879107
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office whispered: ee: cree.	7844.534855896103
They always build one door opposite another for the wind to.	9261.687723618175
Way in.	6613.212237952745
Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk.	13514.884157369128
Mary, Martha.	12904.871627421455
Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.	15711.715663193478
— Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.	1768.884591735775
— Yes, Red Murray agreed.	2467.146925550664
But Mario was said to be the picture of Our Saviour.	8751.80018814832
Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs.	15899.200978271776
Hand on his heart.	10496.456187650057
In <URL> Co - ome thou lost one, Co - ome thou dear one! THE CROZIER AND THE PEN — His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.	11566.997143724637
They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish.	10562.58167182532
A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word: _ — Freeman! _ Mr Bloom said slowly: — Well, he is one of our saviours also.	10689.806750573476
A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now reverberating boards.	12266.112953376987
But will he save the circulation?	9864.230204435002
Thumping.	9728.691757493107
Thumping.	9728.691757493107
He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper.	8641.288496146184
Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti ’ s reading closet.	13853.503034185085
WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS Hynes here too: account of the funeral probably.	14505.025557903457

Like these, got out of hand: fermenting.	12120.611344784242
Working away, tearing away.	10905.805568637757
And that old grey rat tearing to get in.	6121.264157752482
HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman ’ s spare body, admiring a glossy crown.	15238.09474443955
Strange he never saw his real country.	13111.847400761417

Now if he got paralysed there and no - one knew how to stop them they ’ d clank on and on the same, print it over and over and up and back.	9553.146078869197

— Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.	4079.479213665031
Soon be calling him my lord mayor.	14116.371927905662
Long John is backing him, they say.	6338.673638636545
The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter.	10513.542029866992
He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.	9749.276159573958
— Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.	5587.868040945073
Mr Bloom stood in his way.	2884.6179423756175
— If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb.	6705.762287945665
— Did you?	1226.1910118224355
— Mm, Mr Bloom said.	1064.328712521905
Look sharp and you ’ ll catch him.	5336.238568294196
— Thanks, old man, Hynes said.	2491.5950227123226
I ’ ll tap him too.	1922.1419933533166
He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman ’ s Journal_.	9257.561644704894
Three bob I lent him in Meagher ’ s.	6378.106687019553
Three weeks.	8273.65294906358
Third hint.	16878.573427268955
WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti ’ s desk.	14769.196100194617
— Excuse me, councillor, he said.	1623.129045304696
Keyes, you remember?	10179.533845804985
Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.	9391.421528333422
— He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.	2268.5813134502664
The foreman moved his pencil towards it.	4272.602491762916
— But wait, Mr Bloom said.	1009.580204879941
He wants it changed.	4395.392775716698
Keyes, you see.	4010.329351446514
He wants two keys at the top.	5866.381971327051
Hell of a racket they make.	15045.660538537935
He doesn ’ t hear it.	1939.8195859231794
Nannan.	19456.598729469286
Iron nerves.	13208.497172912666
Maybe he understands what I.	9547.72454426302
The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.	11376.611086583884
— Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.	4386.525936311365
Let him take that in first.	7830.120913424429
Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman ’ s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.	10511.7332254105
Clank it.	4243.479819029209
Clank it.	4243.479819029209
Miles of it unreeled.	15674.337355431962
What becomes of it after?	8156.516446846567
O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.	9649.852294922626
Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.	16660.3781151361
HOUSE OF KEY (E) S — Like that, see.	12135.79681750989
Two crossed keys here.	6055.637235445529
A circle.	4005.071671117754
Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant.	13097.931269008759
So on.	2623.3634872583457
Better not teach him his own business.	9834.9972618044
— You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants.	6682.396440429518
Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys.	8819.744643226433
You see?	2833.218556187426
Do you think that ’ s a good idea?	3739.3963445483582
The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.	8592.164798757207
— The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys.	2752.1365679833916
You know, councillor, the Manx parliament.	7945.116516788093
Innuendo of home rule.	16761.06610644281
Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man.	9919.528795521876
Catches the eye, you see.	7350.905256720599
Can you do that?	4718.700537259147
I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <URL> But then if he didn ’ t know only make it awkward for him.	7095.48170429827
Better not.	4255.2663642539555
— We can do that, the foreman said.	3132.567267980895
Have you the design?	6166.47903086588
— I can get it, Mr Bloom said.	1110.9080263927694
It was in a Kilkenny paper.	3843.1350891902416
He has a house there too.	3301.9981342530314
I ’ ll just run out and ask him.	3021.682767102651
Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention.	9314.6191249168
Longfelt want.	14855.367594383912
So on.	2623.3634872583457
The foreman thought for an instant.	4988.906792360508
— We can do that, he said.	1117.033612141946
Let him give us a three months ’ renewal.	10055.293514260498
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage.	9090.146493883105
He began to check it silently.	5905.119301067514
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.	9983.898886955318
ORTHOGRAPHICAL Want to be sure of his spelling.	13265.285988828053

Silly, isn ’ t it?	3622.295829225056
Cemetery put in of course on account of the symmetry.	10966.755685546528
I should have said when he clapped on his topper.	9521.399631407754
Thank you.	2683.281056603683
I ought to have said something about an old hat or something.	6850.073326104166
No. I could have said.	2848.6244809981545

He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.	7855.541759434338
— Monks, sir?	2250.417708321255
— Ay. Where ’ s Monks?	4807.60320565591
— Monks! Mr Bloom took up his cutting.	7283.414317113052
Time to get out.	4783.598471131014
— Then I ’ ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you ’ ll give it a good place I know.	4645.559409778922
— Monks! — Yes, sir.	1656.039037549065

Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs ’ ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned.	13787.718064519197

And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat.	10014.74215121984

Seems to see with his fingers.	8196.028319465238
Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing.	6970.894076025108
Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps.	11104.513288304935
Better phone him up first.	8000.844366266861

Ah, the soap I put there.	5710.493456684564
Lose it out of that pocket.	7209.862549564556
Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.	12078.461571668546
What perfume does your wife use?	5092.709807060688

Just to see: before: dressing.	10222.081251555648
No. Here.	2684.309984101442
No. A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.	8051.505605800463
Know who that is.	5453.662018591298
What ’ s up?	1738.4243403741468
Ned Lambert it is.	3208.5621146745357
He entered softly.	4050.7299076001204
ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA — The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane.	15702.203529180466
Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert ’ s quizzing face, asked of it sourly: — Agonising Christ, wouldn ’ t it give you a heartburn on your arse?	10188.356397182222
Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on: — _Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way, tho ’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters of Neptune ’ s blue domain, ’ mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’ neath the shadows cast o ’ er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest_.	13858.784422000179
What about that, Simon?	4908.577454690357
he asked over the fringe of his newspaper.	8490.836643391682
How ’ s that for high?	4796.016277353657
— Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.	2095.0985273294027
Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating: — _The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_.	12589.607019955945
O boys! O boys! — And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.	8627.402759365066
— That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window.	4282.043530540482
I don ’ t want to hear any more of the stuff.	3713.084289272607
High falutin stuff.	10226.0504207939
Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.	7570.938718628638
Rather upsets a man ’ s day, a funeral does.	8970.98728339923
He has influence they say.	2640.958743609481
Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle.	13952.21588182919
Close on ninety they say.	8178.777237369258

Alleluia.	19456.598729469286
— Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.	2664.468431549506
— What is it?	570.4162250476427
Mr Bloom asked.	890.7170653928929
— A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered with pomp of tone.	8348.769047543921
_Our lovely land_.	18227.54902377354
SHORT BUT TO THE POINT — Whose land?	17357.09006966636
Mr Bloom said simply.	1889.7577890689818
— Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews.	7205.998385300998
With an accent on the whose.	10559.799226403595
— Dan Dawson ’ s land Mr Dedalus said.	2907.143019046122
— Is it his speech last night?	4391.2793301250495
Mr Bloom asked.	890.7170653928929
— But listen to this, he said.	1496.528473588048
The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in.	8637.36339821612
— Excuse me, J.	1873.2940693657333
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy said, entering.	2679.5917630696176
Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.	3908.9753776348975
— I beg yours, he said.	1069.6279869505818
— Good day, Jack.	2299.3243904122655

O ’ Molloy shook his head.	2214.5527897277093
SAD Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be.	9236.53411284176
Decline, poor chap.	10652.426645466128
That hectic flush spells finis for a man.	6352.835282224517
Touch and go with him.	5034.012898777482
What ’ s in the wind, I wonder.	2904.15361913709
Money worry.	12825.330371560169
— _Or again if we but climb the serried mountain <URL> — You ’ re looking extra.	7412.411151718461

J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy asked, looking towards the inner door.	4441.431343494827
— Very much so, professor MacHugh said.	2577.6896111401784
To be seen and heard.	6954.854704644038
He ’ s in his sanctum with Lenehan.	2795.7459958242744
J.	306.21619418874246
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file.	8890.086678810187
Practice dwindling.	16878.573427268955
A mighthavebeen.	4762.787687825449
Losing heart.	10505.52246795041
Gambling.	19456.598729469286
Debts of honour.	13993.953092312358
Reaping the whirlwind.	16807.8688531982
Used to get good retainers from D.	12222.01795846967
and T.	5061.832814606934
Fitzgerald.	19456.598729469286
Their wigs to show the grey matter.	10393.2589517507
Brains on their sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin.	15237.984755303323
Believe he does some literary work for the _Express_ with Gabriel Conroy.	16639.54475310755
Wellread fellow.	11935.765987958663
Myles Crawford began on the <URL> Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening.	13821.063284896178
Weathercocks.	19456.598729469286
Hot and cold in the same breath.	8447.074720618682
Wouldn ’ t know which to believe.	6286.97219343272
One story good till you hear the next.	9355.223876635075
Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over.	11661.682044619973
Hail fellow well met the next moment.	12047.70603769195
— Ah, listen to this for God ’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded.	6513.843255659824
_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks... _ — Bombast! the professor broke in testily.	10167.015512548574
Enough of the inflated windbag! — _Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our souls, as it were... _ — Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said.	7912.0064768982165
Blessed and eternal God! Yes?	14560.147648178743
Is he taking anything for it?	6122.6087608962125
_ — As ’ twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland ’ s portfolio, unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight... _ HIS NATIVE DORIC — The moon, professor MacHugh said.	11116.447558795138
He forgot Hamlet.	5472.076278193412
Shite and onions! That ’ ll do, Ned.	8663.216189946175
Life is too short.	11240.183770936126
He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.	10058.736431908168
Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight.	9898.57653644869
An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh ’ s unshaven blackspectacled face.	11532.407726659229
— Doughy Daw! he cried.	4528.130840473682
WHAT WETHERUP SAID All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff.	14945.143928158159
He was in the bakery line too, wasn ’ t he?	3835.110078412976
Why they call him Doughy Daw.	9508.157184752625
Feathered his nest well anyhow.	13170.326936268264
Daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor.	15497.907441658554
Hooked that nicely.	15868.195079096857
Entertainments.	19456.598729469286
Open house.	6555.322215011692
Big blowout.	10037.122264014808
Wetherup always said that.	8680.436973362914
Get a grip of them by the stomach.	11452.296975976169
The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in.	11444.546773544527
The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked: — What is it?	5569.395203171175
— And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.	7567.578621266713
— Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.	8980.02495869115
— Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat.	3115.9469384574395
I must get a drink after that.	4233.948490828261
— Drink! the editor cried.	3784.5517953877425
No drinks served before mass.	8037.365346273972
— Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out.	3235.419868457636
Come on, Ned.	3816.9939415744375
Ned Lambert sidled down from the table.	5513.6841514372745
The editor ’ s blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom ’ s face, shadowed by a smile.	7047.489238670314
— Will you join us, Myles?	5799.238025046289
Ned Lambert asked.	2802.6945636846804
MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED — North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece.	13723.157289839095
We won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers! — Where was that, Myles?	12476.341956203367
Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps.	11290.424586809479
— In Ohio! the editor shouted.	5647.083992057585
— So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.	5834.217048458818
Passing out he whispered to J.	8036.694974341953
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy: — Incipient jigs.	4714.985508702701
Sad case.	8354.54517523262
— Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.	8248.533020989315
My Ohio! — A perfect cretic! the professor said.	6186.2884468724615
Long, short and long.	10828.79323353012
O, HARP EOLIAN! He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.	11472.813320713067
— Bingbang, bangbang.	5817.3251072490575
Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.	5845.709416667451
— Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said.	2213.6659111216763
I just want to phone about an ad.	7808.777514773484
He went in.	1789.7080454872328
— What about that leader this evening?	4567.033348631777
professor MacHugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.	12333.244611044945
— That ’ ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly.	2921.71673331804
Never you fret.	10227.348794111555
Hello, Jack.	6033.605245155759
That ’ s all right.	779.6058798277994
— Good day, Myles, J.	2204.2559131874445
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file.	6893.721644191666
Is that Canada swindle case on today?	7966.540093289231
The telephone whirred inside.	4764.02348001586
— Twentyeight...	1030.4471188054533
Double four...	2969.077448749569
Yes.	804.865728120872
SPOT THE WINNER Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_ ’ s tissues.	11561.079664585519
— Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup?	6287.575152371298
he asked.	1146.2406223222367
Sceptre with O.	10679.070844931222
Madden up.	4611.188242053327
He tossed the tissues on to the table.	4005.4074735386166
Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.	13449.087028147123
— Hush, Lenehan said.	1750.7820321659026
I hear feetstoops.	4236.220010380216
Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps.	11837.688931966155
The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.	9354.675003324543
— It wasn ’ t me, sir.	2088.867377614154
It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.	3220.9457805249663
— Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said.	5187.638086698261
There ’ s a hurricane blowing.	3070.5910547072563
Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.	11962.267354657986
— Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said.	5263.24790110101
It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir.	3177.7684654069953
He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.	10082.72232348637
— Him, sir.	1699.5122809813008
— Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.	7197.068411768855
He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.	7514.613854989677
J.	306.21619418874246
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking: — Continued on page six, column four.	9243.109944986969
— Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.	4179.641089141614
Is the boss...?	3251.8055164984007
Yes, _Telegraph_...	1415.1844504272171
To where?	7236.867882802235
Aha! Which auction rooms?...	3909.975814936735
Aha! I see...	2704.607105095007
Right.	4326.4089046735135
I ’ ll catch him.	1096.1307876768897
A COLLISION ENSUES The bell whirred again as he rang off.	8808.464150632153
He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.	10528.672577546897
— _Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.	8744.948921464484
— My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip.	4153.639399675895
Are you hurt?	6264.259267072098
I ’ m in a hurry.	2179.6374596904025
— Knee, Lenehan said.	1750.7820321659026
He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee: — The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.	10493.806215843511
— Sorry, Mr Bloom said.	1064.3367617455
He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused.	6563.975281419665
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy slapped the heavy pages over.	4418.906634063527
The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps: We are the boys of Wexford Who fought with heart and hand.	11982.15242906409
EXIT BLOOM — I ’ m just running round to Bachelor ’ s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes ’ s.	6149.861543416552
Want to fix it up.	4169.945736381436
They tell me he ’ s round there in Dillon ’ s.	4865.541881794565
He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces.	5483.213582183927
The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.	11534.472166910326
— Begone! he said.	1326.5518039629503
The world is before you.	3403.3870140152967
— Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.	4112.05591761093
J.	306.21619418874246
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan ’ s hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment.	9274.025576263706
— He ’ ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind.	6106.6942968915
Look at the young scamps after him.	4836.667669735567
— Show.	2622.4527684081218
Where?	1599.242359848175
Lenehan cried, running to the window.	7469.530148459059
A STREET CORTÈGE Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom ’ s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots.	11937.172135852445
— Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and you ’ ll kick.	6292.924338584715
O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk.	8350.127428995318
Small nines.	15707.401234162882
Steal upon larks.	18227.54902377354
He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J.	8680.022795564559
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.	6043.957066662003
— What ’ s that?	636.9127384647712
Myles Crawford said with a start.	6614.548291925516
Where are the other two gone?	7741.564422364907
— Who?	651.1040733368873
the professor said, turning.	3990.635427250545
They ’ re gone round to the Oval for a drink.	6643.871564518615
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall.	14961.606855413993
Came over last night.	8110.849548459403
— Come on then, Myles Crawford said.	1866.8926503569924
Where ’ s my hat?	3984.4785996876712
He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket.	10331.011767682456
They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.	10449.561907371939
— He ’ s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.	4334.642800254894
— Seems to be, J.	2819.467813203008
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems.	7163.388258626089
Who has the most matches?	8540.733459615793
THE CALUMET OF PEACE He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself.	11586.764557495977
Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn.	12679.88519933801
J.	306.21619418874246
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy opened his case again and offered it.	4658.730715983346
— _Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.	5503.310322333659
The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.	7775.83501282817
He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh: ’ Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, ’ Twas empire charmed thy heart.	11705.56380627752
The professor grinned, locking his long lips.	6420.670805993178
— Eh?	1732.609485688752
You bloody old Roman empire?	9221.722901113999
Myles Crawford said.	1440.6536757174013
He took a cigarette from the open case.	4975.24812540535
Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said: — Silence for my brandnew riddle! — _Imperium romanum_, J.	9592.735346006602
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy said gently.	2145.859190366793
It sounds nobler than British or Brixton.	10359.32896051411
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.	7668.291346186885
Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.	12440.550318735503
— That ’ s it, he said.	709.84817149443
We are the fat.	4114.91091750526
You and I are the fat in the fire.	7880.116190725859
We haven ’ t got the chance of a snowball in hell.	9394.735425227344
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME — Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws.	9665.785403799258
We mustn ’ t be led away by words, by sounds of words.	8862.125381096084
We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative.	12410.168822051455
He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing: — What was their civilisation?	10465.632962506606
Vast, I allow: but vile.	17465.8356101
Cloacae: sewers.	18227.54902377354
The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to be here.	7785.36464041438
Let us build an altar to Jehovah_.	10380.090060930394
The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession.	14027.775542423376
He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to be here.	6837.681539656604
Let us construct a <URL> — Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said.	6872.670336944946
Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness ’ s, were partial to the running stream.	10685.753596233151
— They were nature ’ s gentlemen, J.	3589.2327505041935
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy murmured.	2691.362972982999
But we have also Roman law.	7032.226185943849
— And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.	6710.650119478405
— Do you know that story about chief baron Palles?	5045.531446497154
J.	306.21619418874246
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy asked.	1409.0438128056562
Everything was going swimmingly...	4278.696357596225
— First my riddle, Lenehan said.	2756.362127828532
Are you ready?	6635.212618609427
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from the hallway.	8330.583619130239
Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.	9395.729283425906
— _Entrez, mes enfants! _ Lenehan cried.	6683.329599630067
Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety.	16702.556416774543
— How do you do?	1593.3586320808959
the editor said, holding out a hand.	7061.491567423003
Come in.	2657.565162561347
Your governor is just gone.	8707.682581550423
???	18679.353310142404
Lenehan said to all: — Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline?	12198.433885306911
Reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply.	15762.484269390698
Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.	11758.182590127586
— Who?	651.1040733368873
the editor asked.	4620.908799381211
Bit torn off.	8354.2417510934
— Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.	1744.9953005091074
— That old pelters, the editor said.	2624.007465527775
Who tore it?	4389.923446767945
Was he short taken?	10488.695379641136
On swift sail flaming From storm and south He comes, pale vampire, Mouth to my mouth.	12308.343319952763
— Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their shoulders.	4708.703451464904
Foot and mouth?	10606.010705674244
Are you turned...?	3018.0494046004683
Bullockbefriending bard.	14193.346567858416
SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT — Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing.	8391.88946527431
The letter is not mine.	5343.202695486336
Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to...	2850.637898164892
— O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too.	3061.92912521576
The bloodiest old tartar God ever made.	8523.723625163871
By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter ’ s face in the Star and Garter.	11036.93735706543
Oho! A woman brought sin into the world.	8109.39074392359
For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks.	9308.7906753327
O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	4057.5647758855093
— Is he a widower?	3970.236041922004
Stephen asked.	1428.5347086661152
— Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the typescript.	6428.18887646446
Emperor ’ s horses.	11892.615808084443
Habsburg.	19456.598729469286
An Irishman saved his life on the ramparts of Vienna.	11897.220723175287
Don ’ t you forget! Maximilian Karl O ’ Donnell, graf von Tirconnell in Ireland.	7000.646285636081
Going to be trouble there one day.	8979.460529502032
Wild geese.	11484.279349821476
O yes, every time.	3712.6817686430663
Don ’ t you forget that! — The moot point is did he forget it, J.	5947.462925852758
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy said quietly, turning a horseshoe paperweight.	5322.826609292355
Saving princes is a thank you job.	14305.97643466795
Professor MacHugh turned on him.	5119.078878240949
— And if not?	2020.1457681368931
he said.	497.15978922676095
— I ’ ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began.	2814.8303260790863
A Hungarian it was one day...	3119.1029961342906
LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED — We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.	9198.758621272642
Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination.	13906.205999951675
We were never loyal to the successful.	10206.43859406797
We serve them.	3848.561583936089
I teach the blatant Latin language.	7283.258898975961
I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money.	10586.011724901467
Material domination.	16878.573427268955
_Dominus! _ Lord! Where is the spirituality?	16669.808488045397
Lord Jesus?	11107.817728783746
Lord Salisbury?	11107.817728783746
But the Greek! KYRIE ELEISON! A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.	10551.618988592843
— The Greek! he said again.	2734.433409081654
_Kyrios! _ Shining word! The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not.	15016.516319200975
_Kyrie! _ The radiance of the intellect.	13792.213285728876
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind.	6781.192830188501
_Kyrie eleison! _ The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.	14409.347478368018
We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium, _ that went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami.	12634.899397179282
They went under.	6042.846031694141
Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece.	15339.17161817487
Loyal to a lost cause.	13855.714415493745
He strode away from them towards the window.	6236.469092095386
— They went forth to battle, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell.	6338.815875520003
— Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise.	7793.4905614309655
Owing to a brick received in the latter half of the _matinée_.	15925.003579832468
Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus! He whispered then near Stephen ’ s ear: LENEHAN ’ S LIMERICK — _There ’ s a ponderous pundit MacHugh Who wears goggles of ebony hue.	12020.275380751487
As he mostly sees double To wear them why trouble?	10600.375491766785
I can ’ t see the Joe Miller.	3497.163823498791
Can you? _ In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says.	10612.305172757184
Whose mother is beastly dead.	10510.850474487825
Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.	9721.498478432897
— That ’ ll be all right, he said.	939.1962761026087
I ’ ll read the rest after.	2612.2705985927405
That ’ ll be all right.	1305.7442491106706
Lenehan extended his hands in protest.	11441.400916551758
— But my riddle! he said.	1799.2508022118009
What opera is like a railwayline?	7652.876615759678
— Opera?	3451.237535283804
Mr O ’ Madden Burke ’ s sphinx face reriddled.	5521.858309708432
Lenehan announced gladly: — _The Rose of Castile_.	12655.327869648563
See the wheeze?	8039.311134063116
Rows of cast steel.	11077.741722853016
Gee! He poked Mr O ’ Madden Burke mildly in the spleen.	11045.23943143579
Mr O ’ Madden Burke fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.	7943.41408524504
— Help! he sighed.	6373.845082007379
I feel a strong weakness.	5661.706568253793
Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.	12668.866243874414
— Paris, past and present, he said.	2685.201737709948
You look like communards.	6712.92898697018
— Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J.	5739.559006202168
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy said in quiet mockery.	3940.3377893694146
Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you?	8905.546908851315
You look as though you had done the deed.	9745.001110836618
General Bobrikoff.	13656.980144780464
OMNIUM GATHERUM — We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.	5969.269597901702
— All the talents, Myles Crawford said.	2409.7431594580817
Law, the classics...	4574.983028816774
— The turf, Lenehan put in.	3914.0599380793383
— Literature, the press.	5036.109340263375
— If Bloom were here, the professor said.	2941.505327739286
The gentle art of advertisement.	6389.647147204765
— And Madam Bloom, Mr O ’ Madden Burke added.	3688.8793597230924
The vocal muse.	5018.269448422289
Dublin ’ s prime favourite.	13087.399190330212
Lenehan gave a loud cough.	11309.75074619829
— Ahem! he said very softly.	5364.019759568317
O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a cold in the park.	7561.263135203699
The gate was open.	4285.125747877552
“ YOU CAN DO IT! ” The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen ’ s shoulder.	10994.145104976493
— I want you to write something for me, he said.	2277.4602244891926
Something with a bite in it.	4845.888246430602
You can do it.	2130.7464191367117
I see it in your face.	2619.43883448011
_In the lexicon of youth_...	4752.555748200382
See it in your face.	3922.4199325481904
See it in your eye.	4978.438567521707
Lazy idle little schemer.	11955.37773549704
— Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective.	6805.9723480209705
Great nationalist meeting in Borris - in - Ossory.	12476.932579395021
All balls! Bulldosing the public! Give them something with a bite in it.	8362.916128300029
Put us all into it, damn its soul.	12412.105490727045
Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M ’ Carthy.	11346.51274962731
— We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	3310.1916573668777
Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.	9810.531082248293
— He wants you for the pressgang, J.	3585.7636432933396
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy said.	777.0663592827124
THE GREAT GALLAHER — You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.	10735.733570660661
Wait a minute.	5044.920149194199
We ’ ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence.	9960.97088975255
Gallaher, that was a pressman for you.	6410.341515709883
That was a pen.	4304.21820860645
You know how he made his mark?	7156.850619756418
I ’ ll tell you.	679.6773458576052
That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known.	7528.911574861681
I ’ ll show you.	1043.3485981943147
He pushed past them to the files.	7737.314156610478
The _New York World_ cabled for a special.	9112.030500757013
Remember that time?	7703.466307993221
Professor MacHugh nodded.	9232.901040725437
— _New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.	7378.681170459411
Where it took place.	5963.682849494535
Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean.	12513.970841515793
Joe Brady and the rest of them.	6191.188912748749
Where Skin - the - Goat drove the car.	5518.723399528083
Whole route, see?	9283.201769672294
— Skin - the - Goat, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	2381.1252442760474
Fitzharris.	19456.598729469286
He has that cabman ’ s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge.	6273.042932313523
Holohan told me.	5467.413998326407
You know Holohan?	4948.32322048948
— Hop and carry one, is it?	3820.5223085497832
Myles Crawford said.	1440.6536757174013
— And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for the corporation.	8479.083743372606
A night watchman.	6108.478345590255
Stephen turned in surprise.	6572.069660758265
— Gumley?	3451.237535283804
he said.	497.15978922676095
You don ’ t say so?	2836.393233358578
— Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily.	6651.098910325856
Look at here.	3059.054624713256
What did Ignatius Gallaher do?	4728.565680903866
I ’ ll tell you.	679.6773458576052
Inspiration of genius.	14632.453802818965
Cabled right away.	10606.972465452616
Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of <NUM> March?	9845.75491862457
Right.	4326.4089046735135
Have you got that?	3164.0057548430677
He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.	10089.045936762552
— Take page four, advertisement for Bransome ’ s coffee, let us say.	8103.841522377152
Have you got that?	3164.0057548430677
Right.	4326.4089046735135
The telephone whirred.	4627.413957251361
A DISTANT VOICE — I ’ ll answer it, the professor said, going.	4904.048129354288
— B is parkgate.	5817.3251072490575
Good.	3567.3665975662016
His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.	11827.25075403905
— T is viceregal lodge.	5772.418654233185
C is where murder took place.	8439.819961286707
K is Knockmaroon gate.	11327.214568432273
The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock ’ s wattles.	10585.520037817842
An illstarched dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat.	12117.987572118458
— Hello?	1854.5504339960921
_Evening Telegraph_ here...	3795.3012737090626
Hello?...	1488.5829061845498
Who ’ s there?...	1499.073987040917
Yes...	580.6315833796613
Yes...	580.6315833796613
Yes.	804.865728120872
— F to P is the route Skin - the - Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh.	10151.862003692755
<URL>. Got that?	5556.2827865528
X is Davy ’ s publichouse in upper Leeson street.	9598.512063375414
The professor came to the inner door.	4964.938837571435
— Bloom is at the telephone, he said.	2472.861357255186
— Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly.	6565.264076081078
X is Davy ’ s publichouse, see?	9138.727916230942
CLEVER, VERY — Clever, Lenehan said.	6746.534017394213
Very.	9941.152936667111
— Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody history.	7754.705755321153
Nightmare from which you will never awake.	16159.537814250194
— I saw it, the editor said proudly.	4490.931923845452
I was present.	2625.0024281046017
Dick Adams, the besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and myself.	14465.10697555667
Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing: — Madam, I ’ m Adam.	9783.901333584654
And Able was I ere I saw Elba.	10227.240078087914
— History! Myles Crawford cried.	4426.1844939397215
The Old Woman of Prince ’ s street was there first.	6873.648916935905
There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that.	6933.557406681993
Out of an advertisement.	7920.571380415362
Gregor Grey made the design for it.	8646.97932283404
That gave him the leg up.	5182.303351827343
Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the <URL> Now he ’ s got in with Blumenfeld.	10034.447854187942
That ’ s press.	1976.9886121833993
That ’ s talent.	2490.7742234504894
Pyatt! He was all their daddies! — The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the brother - in - law of Chris Callinan.	11722.43610976939
— Hello?...	724.5278543638963
Are you there?...	1807.6435008678561
Yes, he ’ s here still.	3017.926958490678
Come across yourself.	6641.299124074423
— Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh?	6112.189207476433
the editor cried.	4141.926847303871
He flung the pages down.	4374.934777416286
— Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O ’ Madden Burke.	5198.040841971067
— Very smart, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	2290.642971730459
Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.	7017.913299767567
— Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder...	5144.689918225496
— O yes, J.	1279.7792333251564
O ’ Molloy said eagerly.	2078.5330459162997
Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she ’ d buy a view of Dublin.	13426.949663132636
And it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin - the - Goat.	7808.1086650865645
Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine! — They ’ re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.	8514.827782498889
Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O ’ Hagan.	14829.939360335511
Eh?	3630.6576605291275
Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.	11455.714779375643
His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.	11401.67167315968
Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss?	13861.144254314282
Why did you write it then?	6513.634427663352
RHYMES AND REASONS Mouth, south.	16112.599242811839
Is the mouth south someway?	9938.184802125854
Or the south a mouth?	8566.353316148501
Must be some.	4377.328384732737
South, pout, out, shout, drouth.	15235.557021458062
Rhymes: two men dressed the same, looking the same, two by two.	11891.782726726891

He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in russet, entwining, _per l ’ aer perso_, in mauve, in purple, _quella pacifica oriafiamma_, gold of oriflamme, _di rimirar fè più <URL> But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb womb.	14531.393182943899

O ’ Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.	6933.715296441621
— My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false construction on my words.	7251.827920736822
I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running away with you.	10518.856546895591
Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke?	12124.864484657302
Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly ’ s Budget_, _Pue ’ s Occurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_.	16114.305080709195
Why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside?	12537.295799471016
Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof.	15573.702118131107
LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE — Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his face.	11579.323302957377
Irish volunteers.	14855.255256694101
Where are you now?	4093.986234570982

Dr Lucas.	13656.980144780464
Who have you now like John Philpot Curran?	12099.744296827283
Psha! — Well, J.	4405.795822308662
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy said, Bushe <URL>., for example.	4405.510403262964
— Bushe?	3451.237535283804
the editor said.	2059.3645261657393
Well, yes: Bushe, yes.	4494.910687805452
He has a strain of it in his blood.	5506.103056496793
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.	14303.960559241717
— He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for....	3418.5153962296363
But no matter.	5633.236092894116
J.	306.21619418874246
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly: — One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe.	8903.515643698871
It was in that case of fratricide, the Childs murder case.	7462.136864649094
Bushe defended him.	7379.314753505786
_And in the porches of mine ear did <URL> By the way how did he find that out?	13950.509266545756
He died in his sleep.	5317.2870847322665
Or the other story, beast with two backs?	10489.039866245468
— What was that?	1222.0420971630213
the professor asked.	3929.2940279633435
ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM — He spoke on the law of evidence, J.	10166.65215722795
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy said, of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_.	8279.113671752899
And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.	8894.416218577466
— Ha. — A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced.	9297.657420467454
J.	306.21619418874246
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy took out his cigarettecase.	4451.915629573792
False lull.	18679.07077551165
Something quite ordinary.	11185.202976064158
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.	14909.396361937977
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.	11857.184443440336
A POLISHED PERIOD J.	3448.690678515749
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy resumed, moulding his words: — He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to <URL> His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.	12543.999861707833
— Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.	4341.802940222275
— The divine afflatus, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	2272.928972928424
— You like it?	1936.9108297276487
J.	306.21619418874246
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy asked Stephen.	2392.739067578727
Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.	10583.574940524231
He took a cigarette from the case.	4354.069771937739
J.	306.21619418874246
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy offered his case to Myles Crawford.	5357.123173263518
Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying: — Muchibus thankibus.	11254.452931516482
A MAN OF HIGH MORALE — Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.	8460.34510528051
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy said to Stephen.	1972.1597531517239
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A.	8394.010537164131
E.	1948.1085920489277
the mastermystic?	10378.159264514383
She was a nice old bag of tricks.	7055.13448995006
A.	567.5270913964941
E.	1948.1085920489277
has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness.	13364.029580037355
Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A.	10296.627571600777
E. ’ s leg.	7668.527821533315
He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.	6852.839114643666
Speaking about me.	6809.856029582505
What did he say?	2602.1766733739287
What did he say?	2602.1766733739287
What did he say about me?	4045.9301042980646
Don ’ t ask.	3267.2091606305175
— No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.	5499.737372393525
Wait a moment.	3074.825377172394
Let me say one thing.	6381.210772049417
The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society.	12017.519559357643
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.	13145.572403895114
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said: — You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.	6482.154415575907
Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.	10720.772076918855
— He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.	3158.670487265723
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy said, rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission.	5723.595317707986
— He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child ’ s frock.	5689.826820951424
Go on.	3787.7701533128234
— It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man ’ s contumely upon the new movement.	10471.805909529356
It was then a new movement.	5217.356668027619
We were weak, therefore worthless.	9589.062043253316
He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.	13434.453034093824
IMPROMPTU In ferial tone he addressed J.	10673.027971934183
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy: — Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.	7818.211962867275
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall.	10052.621206152065
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it.	8193.587675250923
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.	9471.894682277658
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.	7395.367439932134
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy ’ s towards Stephen ’ s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking.	6196.587004683227
His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair.	11163.869943910502
Still seeking, he said: — When Fitzgibbon ’ s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.	8759.287245211339
Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.	13362.811902836083
He raised his head firmly.	5402.609965001383
His eyes bethought themselves once more.	5616.656842868693
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.	13590.31874339573
He began: _ — Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend.	11135.908643839672
It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful <URL> His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech.	13678.862926145921
_And let our crooked <URL> Noble words coming.	13114.27500216892
Could you try your hand at it yourself?	12209.913625038733
_ — And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.	9820.726161764887
I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to <URL> FROM THE FATHERS It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted.	13799.628312746641
Ah, curse you! That ’ s saint Augustine.	6915.9296208105125
_ — Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language?	10674.446209744821
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.	9082.798883675714
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe.	12793.259615599907
You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a <URL> Nile.	12005.019726668917
Child, man, effigy.	13496.696159876396
By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.	12706.455387352871
_ — You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas.	13656.733999085202
Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms.	15590.558190442325
Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our <URL> A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech.	15714.765335359394
He lifted his voice above it boldly: _ — But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day.	11279.956767209884
He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai ’ s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the <URL> He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.	10867.015309144688
OMINOUS — FOR HIM! J.	10105.150386116524
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy said not without regret: — And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.	7152.056991087425
— A — sudden — at — the — moment — though — from — lingering — illness — often — previously — expectorated — demise, Lenehan added.	11738.771776577829
And with a great future behind him.	4487.872098429311
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase.	9985.872152485197
— That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.	4319.771870047491
Gone with the wind.	8351.574731819901
Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.	16743.705150344183
Miles of ears of porches.	15786.109314441857
The tribune ’ s words, howled and scattered to the four winds.	9271.71794205242
A people sheltered within his voice.	5919.463500926423
Dead noise.	9492.308915471738
Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was.	12230.174413225017
Love and laud him: me no more.	8664.315486229023
I have money.	1968.9115639157485
— Gentlemen, Stephen said.	1185.6471462137035
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn?	13317.704211628417
— You take my breath away.	3659.5644961187727
It is not perchance a French compliment?	7075.03121166994
Mr O ’ Madden Burke asked.	2359.6320646108024
’ Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.	13020.751833941415
— That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved.	6943.292002861638
All that are in favour say ay, Lenehan announced.	10802.461893906819
The contrary no.	3547.54446288259
I declare it carried.	5686.591445959499
To which particular boosing shed...?	4214.37265456742
My casting vote is: Mooney ’ s! He led the way, admonishing: — We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not?	11994.591981155621
Yes, we will not.	4093.8620003790993
By no manner of means.	7697.053009611143
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally ’ s lunge of his umbrella: — Lay on, Macduff! — Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the shoulder.	10280.495970592216
Let us go.	4300.541511326003
Where are those blasted keys?	7664.6816005578185
He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.	8579.664820413456
— Foot and mouth.	2904.072825342078
I know.	742.0041386124677
That ’ ll be all right.	1305.7442491106706
That ’ ll go in.	2311.934145601712
Where are they?	3961.3565245573545
That ’ s all right.	779.6058798277994
He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.	6669.6403356764995
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen: — I hope you will live to see it published.	8211.96215836037
Myles, one moment.	8165.5229860309955
He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.	5030.599062305986
— Come along, Stephen, the professor said.	2050.27899964261
That is fine, isn ’ t it?	3048.3001716857266
It has the prophetic vision.	7953.323271365488
_Fuit Ilium! _ The sack of windy Troy.	14487.15278764925
Kingdoms of this world.	9741.306201249943
The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.	7318.151311005906
The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling: — Racing special! Dublin.	10659.41681118923
I have much, much to learn.	6739.82481510366
They turned to the left along Abbey street.	5154.752620347032
— I have a vision too, Stephen said.	1562.0585806640788
— Yes?	978.2723092978424
the professor said, skipping to get into step.	7652.645894735941
Crawford will follow.	18227.54902377354
Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran: — Racing special! DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN Dubliners.	14468.802852583254
— Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally ’ s lane.	8451.41004554722
— Where is that?	1447.766829658769
the professor asked.	3929.2940279633435
— Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.	1566.6745937076012
Damp night reeking of hungry dough.	16702.366946211594
Against the wall.	7851.718452199476
Face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl.	16158.505975322381
Frantic hearts.	15707.401234162855
Akasic records.	15251.62811167228
Quicker, darlint! On now.	10298.766957063048
Dare it.	5751.538303898366
Let there be life.	6291.837178384411
— They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	5214.587190417174
They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox.	12327.606514676469
They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife.	12569.531535189077
Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers.	12290.934332638019
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.	12571.124186401923
— Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.	2890.6340996356093
LIFE ON THE RAW — They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins, proprietress...	12318.13547473139
They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson ’ s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn.	10733.336332015273
They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.	13218.008992916162
Glory be to God.	7854.920926107794
They had no idea it was that high.	8029.004769607651
Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe.	13380.664667965038
Anne Kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father.	15330.121100441802
Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.	14510.33102424098
— Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice.	4832.863813930983
Vestal virgins.	14855.255256694074
I can see them.	2086.9244857919803
What ’ s keeping our friend?	4270.251923795776
He turned.	1517.7711539770503
A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering.	11682.864173356495
Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking with J.	11217.695533037018
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy.	1726.2528762836153
— Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.	5066.80535755625
He set off again to walk by Stephen ’ s side.	6571.001706930161
RETURN OF BLOOM — Yes, he said.	2763.872141310944
I see them.	1550.6189137340612
Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called: — Mr Crawford! A moment! — _Telegraph_! Racing special! — What is it?	9540.441458962327
Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.	7422.53294039397
A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom ’ s face: — Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows! INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR — Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket.	9390.441093339887
I spoke with Mr Keyes just now.	5280.2227168321
He ’ ll give a renewal for two months, he says.	5726.020061432672
After he ’ ll see.	4646.775207477143
But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the Saturday pink.	10430.04681106142
And he wants it copied if it ’ s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_.	8156.327308106076
I can have access to it in the national library.	5268.418948256781
House of keys, don ’ t you see?	3697.1269500837516
His name is Keyes.	6278.999589266006
It ’ s a play on the name.	2438.493786735559
But he practically promised he ’ d give the renewal.	6570.1104703311075
But he wants just a little puff.	6925.962627000742
What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?	7227.922579386743
<URL>. — Will you tell him he can kiss my arse?	10623.600219996126
Myles Crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis.	9521.589490493525

Usual blarney.	16878.573427268955
Has a good pair of boots on him today.	11258.020359696166
Last time I saw him he had his heels on view.	10506.69065207592
Been walking in muck somewhere.	12322.16135150095
What was he doing in Irishtown?	6035.613756718236
— Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I suppose it ’ s worth a short par.	5023.707940181926
He ’ d give the ad, I think.	3230.9493757519676
I ’ ll tell him...	776.6538715678824
<URL>. — He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his shoulder.	8772.548981888205
Any time he likes, tell him.	7977.229447058864
RAISING THE WIND — _Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin.	7802.306283241167
I ’ m up to here.	1973.671263765698
I ’ ve been through the hoop myself.	4591.304087389186
I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week.	9106.92138357295
Sorry, Jack.	9143.907907729154
You must take the will for the deed.	9085.28146860622

O ’ Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently.	6573.378851522652
They caught up on the others and walked abreast.	9544.15420652532
— When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings.	11730.709270434478
— Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford.	6223.675157904478
Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	7020.502685298146
SOME COLUMN! — THAT ’ S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID — That ’ s new, Myles Crawford said.	7307.468702394837
That ’ s copy.	2490.7742234504894
Out for the waxies ’ Dargle.	13192.654952898982
Two old trickies, what?	5974.293846857437
— But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.	7038.954638544927
They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines ’ blue dome, Adam and Eve ’ s, saint Laurence O ’ Toole ’ s.	9355.055521222486
THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES — Easy all, Myles Crawford said.	7178.306120160912
No poetic licence.	6919.411981522894
We ’ re in the archdiocese here.	4158.114166090674
— And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer.	8143.200183019918
— Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried.	5057.379916628298
I like that.	1201.4358627055208
I see the idea.	3574.4519912630253
I see what you mean.	4198.3040792870615
DAMES DONATE DUBLIN ’ S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF — It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak.	11527.654225677947
They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.	12118.829387314565
He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close.	9293.137409918307
Lenehan and Mr O ’ Madden Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney ’ s.	7571.406143353697
— Finished?	3451.237535283804
Myles Crawford said.	1440.6536757174013
So long as they do no worse.	8077.3999600278785
SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS.	18227.54902377354
— You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist.	6801.116975708303
It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself.	10051.758955921516
He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman.	6315.043468208236
And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.	9208.099870085054
Poor Penelope.	7737.43763541091

Myles Crawford asked.	4414.34443434679
Where did they get the plums?	9102.197808600578
VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE.	17932.61452774436

Call it, let me see.	5799.227289456994
Call it: _deus nobis hæc otia <URL> — No, Stephen said.	5419.603405499641
I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of The <URL> — I see, the professor said.	5807.736502894425
He laughed richly.	4259.431819402189
— I see, he said again with new pleasure.	3016.140160618054

He halted on sir John Gray ’ s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson through the meshes of his wry smile.	11275.829310056093
DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS.	17356.98505688499

That tickles me, I must say.	5755.33476692009

Well, of course, if we knew all the things.	5480.499109396349
Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt quaywalls, gulls.	15091.55011937807
Rough weather outside.	15868.195079096857

They wheeled lower.	6318.5241397988175
Looking for grub.	10283.952773294715

Elijah thirtytwo feet per sec is com.	13493.974394444618

Not such damn fools.	9622.355479913587
Also the day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin ’ s King picked it up in the wake fifty yards astern.	9588.848778135285

They wheeled, flapping.	7416.834949616813
The hungry famished gull Flaps o ’ er the waters dull.	6902.240855343664
That is how poets write, the similar sounds.	8783.52876265301
But then Shakespeare has no rhymes: blank verse.	9766.252026198883

Those poor birds.	8979.044594883375
He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the Liffey.	11471.79849971288
See that?	3993.226665617343
The gulls swooped silently, two, then all from their heights, pouncing on prey.	10991.674557119126

Penny quite enough.	10831.61088918929
Lot of thanks I get.	11969.470971104383

But then why is it that saltwater fish are not salty?	10266.370222819934

She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice.	8319.089330706047
He has legs like barrels and you ’ d think he was singing into a barrel.	8782.065205153276
Now, isn ’ t that wit.	6277.887022081132
They used to call him big Ben.	7462.461045740606
Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone.	10848.03371103158
Appetite like an albatross.	17932.97617082364
Get outside of a baron of beef.	13321.838807216309
Barrel of Bass.	18227.54902377354
It all works out.	4628.831561901429
A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards.	12127.39801231169
Bargains.	19456.598729469286
Like that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered.	11136.015357597245
He read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H.	8843.554093927994

Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked.	13428.766458106187
Our staple food.	8773.199070725987
Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street.	10474.651002907904
Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly.	13308.565613198605
Doesn ’ t bring in any business either.	9258.392332221523
I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper.	12813.06196598313
I bet that would have caught on.	6262.959153192089
Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once.	11116.605014982002
Everyone dying to know what she ’ s writing.	9448.718102295552
Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing.	10658.905360077564
Women too.	3426.7960112655705
Curiosity.	16997.075953601572
Pillar of salt.	14632.365278478528
Wouldn ’ t have it of course because he didn ’ t think of it himself first.	6843.730194725514
Or the inkbottle I suggested with a false stain of black celluloid.	12256.628890094082
His ideas for ads like Plumtree ’ s potted under the obituaries, cold meat department.	11872.58306814299
You can ’ t lick ’ em.	5086.716493214762
What?	572.8670519115202
Our envelopes.	9416.023915768359
Hello, Jones, where are you going?	10278.954463295122
Can ’ t stop, Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser _Kansell, _ sold by Hely ’ s Ltd, <NUM> Dame street.	10189.124476220195
Well out of that ruck I am.	6828.617213628068

Sister?	8498.96645492669
I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes.	5988.212464162668
Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman.	7473.841476447915
I disturbed her at her devotions that morning.	7200.144186408323
But glad to communicate with the outside world.	8134.3517211611115
Our great day, she said.	3126.5363633839643
Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.	14115.802630403774
Sweet name too: caramel.	14821.269622275324
She knew I, I think she knew by the way she.	6407.348926598407
If she had married she would have changed.	9625.342036518752
I suppose they really were short of money.	5871.52966401452
Fried everything in the best butter all the same.	8662.19200027449
No lard for them.	3393.3154924905375
My heart ’ s broke eating dripping.	10460.804634384323
They like buttering themselves in and out.	5713.28246046515

Year Phil Gilligan died.	12966.097013313783
We were in Lombard street west.	4304.569389096997

She didn ’ t like it because I sprained my ankle first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf.	9659.642358148782
As if that.	3650.4475796247984
Old Goodwin ’ s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff.	11537.37369017679
Flies ’ picnic too.	9272.04612497543
Never put a dress on her back like it.	7754.344546239161
Fitted her like a glove, shoulders and hips.	16057.199880120424
Just beginning to plump it out well.	9395.796599806214
Rabbitpie we had that day.	10906.936272708565

Of course it ’ s years ago.	4761.2379272266135
Noise of the trams probably.	13812.591293051715
Well, if he couldn ’ t remember the dayfather ’ s name that he sees every day.	6308.719845504794
Bartell d ’ Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then.	11555.277079852389
Seeing her home after practice.	16054.114741946907
Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache.	15325.503010854949
Gave her that song _Winds that blow from the south_.	15568.628227684736
Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin ’ s concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house.	14276.562260246354
He and I behind.	4758.969142701303
Sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings.	14043.136093165696
Lucky it didn ’ t.	4693.059082315195
Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her.	10286.679710556136
Professor Goodwin linking her in front.	12427.049005932242
Shaky on his pins, poor old sot.	16675.85493080085

Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust.	17451.799815743565
Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin.	16616.650653700723
She did get flushed in the wind.	5863.746954064175
Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked.	15160.524021212745
And the mulled rum.	4178.701882029512
Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays: white.	12725.794911036068
Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed.	11089.39447865032
Always warm from her.	6133.957435403604
Always liked to let her self out.	8594.291873520684
Sitting there after till near two taking out her hairpins.	15710.595771107148

That was the night...	1297.996041532268
— O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?	2073.0635560225096
— O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?	3765.8093001320303
— No use complaining.	3747.8000875447574
How is Molly those times?	7604.531217141059
Haven ’ t seen her for ages.	9936.816392624782
— In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily.	3575.161721905596
Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.	8621.721512649852
— Go away! Isn ’ t that grand for her?	6170.808684943385
— Yes.	427.3278064178512
In a photographer ’ s there.	4483.933433748875
Getting on like a house on fire.	13499.409864021014
How are all your charges?	7604.925527142808
— All on the baker ’ s list, Mrs Breen said.	5154.290405276091
— You ’ re in black, I see.	2454.424788467517
You have no...	1372.4082570664298
— No, Mr Bloom said.	477.376932156713
I have just come from a funeral.	4825.829396266201
Going to crop up all day, I foresee.	13171.194076328024
Who ’ s dead, when and what did he die of?	7823.01769176698
Turn up like a bad penny.	11421.426868613973
— O, dear me, Mrs Breen said.	2394.9182786005545
I hope it wasn ’ t any near relation.	6414.2935905477925
May as well get her sympathy.	14560.863064343854
— Dignam, Mr Bloom said.	1011.7753037454644
An old friend of mine.	5646.2903561417825
He died quite suddenly, poor fellow.	5716.352605941561
Heart trouble, I believe.	11125.94261457087
Funeral was this morning.	7682.696672284318
Your funeral ’ s tomorrow While you ’ re coming through the rye.	11110.762115071066
Diddlediddle dumdum Diddlediddle...	4020.3976694651114
— Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen ’ s womaneyes said melancholily.	10243.065215401593
Now that ’ s quite enough about that.	4321.656743370666
Just: quietly: husband.	10001.063508903571
— And your lord and master?	4542.792232055961
Hasn ’ t lost them anyhow.	11252.932182623901
— O, don ’ t be talking! she said.	1279.7190619165403
He ’ s a caution to rattlesnakes.	2478.727674935058
He ’ s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel.	6094.762047129373
He has me heartscalded.	4482.822668396977
Wait till I show you.	3328.671607656776
Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison ’ s.	10111.673266024765
The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom ’ s gullet.	6191.935865652913
Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they ’ d taste it with the hot tea.	11750.344967078776
Or is it from her?	6782.06999208055
A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes.	11618.684802559053
Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way.	10555.191470195732
Pleasure or pain is it?	7134.846138757132
Penny dinner.	11935.405025481865
Knife and fork chained to the table.	7946.736030453361

Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle.	16760.897092969924
Pastille that was fell.	14242.011812467861
What is she?...	1185.049189462786
— There must be a new moon out, she said.	2706.0440552925975
He ’ s always bad then.	1892.4833323639411
Do you know what he did last night?	4393.05564438752
Her hand ceased to rummage.	9970.383921321934
Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.	9599.667855894078
— What?	425.82801927876443
Mr Bloom asked.	890.7170653928929
Let her speak.	6512.553005664479
Look straight in her eyes.	5273.987176766017
I believe you.	2000.07846606038
Trust me.	5862.537036087323
— Woke me up in the night, she said.	2647.904061958682
Dream he had, a nightmare.	15352.757308881395
Indiges.	19456.598729469286
— Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.	7923.004381696277
— The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.	1934.6577348204135
She took a folded postcard from her handbag.	9244.814447928928
— Read that, she said.	1893.0613256773324
He got it this morning.	3781.2068462603047
— What is it?	570.4162250476427

— U.	2021.4796633108156
p: up, she said.	2206.386219692586
Someone taking a rise out of him.	5431.2719663230055
It ’ s a great shame for them whoever he is.	3325.733891183199
— Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.	1550.3845358406072
She took back the card, sighing.	7195.67678459914
— And now he ’ s going round to Mr Menton ’ s office.	4395.847520291596
He ’ s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.	4856.0220802436625
She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.	11467.727497938753
Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching.	13842.114987948562
Seen its best days.	11733.482860179562
Wispish hair over her ears.	12430.094764784752
And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to take the harm out of it.	5772.559768210706
Shabby genteel.	18679.07077551165
She used to be a tasty dresser.	5412.539966417802
Lines round her mouth.	8856.962055738471
Only a year or so older than Molly.	9567.746026277911
See the eye that woman gave her, passing.	10292.223980625908
Cruel.	11785.351918411056
The unfair sex.	4737.714177956855

Mr Bloom asked.	890.7170653928929
— Mina Purefoy?	4721.004904578085
she said.	1795.0840059686607
Philip Beaufoy I was thinking.	11020.56608032653
Playgoers ’ Club.	16807.970545269076
Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke.	13038.0860231244
Did I pull the chain?	8353.048754977086
Yes.	804.865728120872

— Yes, Mrs Breen said.	1156.360268621325
And a houseful of kids at home.	5932.730322084725
It ’ s a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.	3726.474720618764
— O, Mr Bloom said.	448.7239490657188
His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news.	8846.511619824823
His tongue clacked in compassion.	8788.299832888517
Dth! Dth! — I ’ m sorry to hear that, he said.	3775.4442697155164
Poor thing! Three days! That ’ s terrible for her.	6008.447739549842
Mrs Breen nodded.	7817.232492042408
— She was taken bad on the Tuesday...	3378.540073191701
Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her: — Mind! Let this man pass.	9404.326441235202
A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass.	12190.915065346238
Tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head.	10504.596182387837
— Watch him, Mr Bloom said.	1139.4751368471973
He always walks outside the lampposts.	8283.02931036889
Watch! — Who is he if it ’ s a fair question?	7554.941788066759
Mrs Breen asked.	4744.544870467691
Is he dotty?	7381.043657466879
— His name is Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr Bloom said smiling.	4307.59261656399
Watch! — He has enough of them, she said.	4769.422257051674
Denis will be like that one of these days.	10134.943584746406
She broke off suddenly.	6713.362022905039
— There he is, she said.	1053.2968907609409
I must go after him.	2603.829565510287
Goodbye.	13490.99621301991
Remember me to Molly, won ’ t you?	4636.773637908267
— I will, Mr Bloom said.	672.0165164338415
He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts.	8548.566849161336
Denis Breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison ’ s hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs.	14767.294502025257
Blown in from the bay.	10999.925751051032
Like old times.	5572.912339280029
He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.	12936.684925146543
Meshuggah.	19456.598729469286
Off his chump.	13814.400447318581
Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat.	10300.24958435002
Going the two days.	9966.223994500871

Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh.	6514.158465478149

No sound.	3556.4221246844227
The sky.	2830.5888173393228
Green by Drumleck.	13492.86464334258
Yellowgreen towards Sutton.	18227.54902377354
Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities.	16649.25636354064
Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you ’ ll toss me all.	11847.98263652726
O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away.	12143.584564462424
Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth.	13081.144918521517
Yum.	19456.598729469286
Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed.	13822.433045309883
Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle.	16651.327928917977

A goat.	4762.787687825449
No - one.	1574.3027984372911
Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded.	17570.648302713715
Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman ’ s breasts full in her blouse of nun ’ s veiling, fat nipples upright.	13795.102777588138
Hot I tongued her.	7749.61028214694
She kissed me.	2218.545216264934
All yielding she tossed my hair.	7837.275418547795
Kissed, she kissed me.	8282.780490713421
Me. And me now.	7241.874991361532

Never speaking.	7627.774195457999

Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian.	14369.375127847761
Immortal lovely.	14193.45389360042
And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine.	13994.320489064226

I ’ ll look today.	1610.6214554799144
Bend down let something fall see if she.	13721.948378029632
Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do.	12896.682886225008
A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.	12847.759218887555
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book: — What is this he is?	9686.764395014608
Isn ’ t he in the insurance line?	7811.853666891457
— He ’ s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said.	2261.139679206533
He does canvassing for the <URL> — I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said.	5524.520997298758
Is he in trouble?	6773.613346302343
— Trouble?	3451.237535283804
Nosey Flynn said.	1478.8165584314772
Not that I heard of.	6081.580247011265
Why?	1336.6418951783915
— Was he?	1780.3546756703045
Nosey Flynn said.	1478.8165584314772
So he was, faith.	3880.8403642267795
I asked him how was all at home.	5307.67772958804
You ’ re right, by God.	3401.683203999985
So he was.	2503.1092288834825
— I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way.	6940.541982131823
It only brings it up fresh in their minds.	11281.881816574378
— It ’ s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.	2033.9263585742951
I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan ’ s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half.	10594.63620444084
She ’ s well nourished, I tell you.	2989.0110181173736
Plovers on toast.	16807.8688531982
— And is he doing for the _Freeman? _ Davy Byrne said.	4667.007552349256
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.	6083.150154129304
You can make bacon of that.	4056.4698222342363
— How so?	1741.3448435930857
Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.	9225.53606119
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers.	9773.221150726733
He winked.	3750.728011825402
— He ’ s in the craft, he said.	1047.6535828267265
— Do you tell me so?	3016.665634620085
Davy Byrne said.	1862.9997629238592
— Very much so, Nosey Flynn said.	2099.38715094101
Ancient free and accepted order.	16054.184121642857
He ’ s an excellent brother.	2177.762611553084
Light, life and love, by God.	9525.957685407775
They give him a leg up.	4379.597509176063
I was told that by a — well, I won ’ t say who.	6503.325446054466
— Is that a fact?	1878.4490592524717
— O, it ’ s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said.	1621.6120378292874
They stick to you when you ’ re down.	5537.523256229413
But they ’ re as close as damn it.	5046.870701534763
By God they did right to keep the women out of it.	5637.766586660113
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one: — Iiiiiichaaaaaaach! — There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing.	11508.154250936526
But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason.	12034.028256419448
That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.	6708.351790275607
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes: — And is that a fact?	10440.026162469343
Decent quiet man he is.	6613.012518073029
I often saw him in here and I never once saw him — you know, over the line.	8935.818993549825
— God Almighty couldn ’ t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.	5578.104115029397
Slips off when the fun gets too hot.	16197.479512728014
Didn ’ t you see him look at his watch?	6685.889306642553
Ah, you weren ’ t there.	5455.985123771741
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe.	11486.472529493156
Declare to God he does.	8442.96870714944
— There are some like that, Davy Byrne said.	2730.0304104828774
— He ’ s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.	2663.0168078189895
He ’ s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow.	6305.569006364572
Give the devil his due.	10723.467537035945
O, Bloom has his good points.	6289.493633534467
But there ’ s one thing he ’ ll never do.	5387.934752102848
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.	9848.551355615913
— I know, Davy Byrne said.	1086.3909256397926
— Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.	3404.328721733713
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in.	8835.014703823712
Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.	11162.02692896207
— Day, Mr Byrne.	5362.340983476548
— Day, gentlemen.	4077.3543495585304
They paused at the counter.	5562.619383970533
— Who ’ s standing?	2838.732845730136
Paddy Leonard asked.	4594.391238321171
— I ’ m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.	2501.37313539641
— Well, what ’ ll it be?	3793.6070054390484
Paddy Leonard asked.	4594.391238321171
— I ’ ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.	2453.0706442805576
— How much?	1911.4180869960692
Paddy Leonard cried.	6747.697452123466
Since when, for God ’ sake?	13517.378816163502
What ’ s yours, Tom?	4333.6365874366775
— How is the main drainage?	4854.110249217646
Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.	10563.728336760907
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.	10199.321643922096
— Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne?	8947.529460446465
he said.	497.15978922676095
— Certainly, sir.	1101.414202748754
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.	12429.23551177568
— Lord love a duck, he said.	2238.8770703724754
Look at what I ’ m standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.	11335.490250887131
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup.	7320.342863989333
A dead snip.	5632.710288770742
— Zinfandel is it?	2012.1408853647629
Nosey Flynn asked.	4302.706748213976
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.	10130.355147533548
— That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.	4483.588515293179
— Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.	3680.805656997615
Tom Rochford nodded and drank.	10624.365528362883
— Is it Zinfandel?	3166.3802153131883
— Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked.	7292.876712972857
I ’ m going to plunge five bob on my own.	3930.3478352208663
— Tell us if you ’ re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said.	5842.121725640447
Who gave it to you?	4755.375828587528
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.	7777.369440823245
— So long! Nosey Flynn said.	2583.399116707832
The others turned.	4124.5694565345575
— Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn.	7385.0420296917655
Mr Byrne, sir, we ’ ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a...	5934.287989972617
— Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.	7520.831208103639
— Ay, Paddy Leonard said.	1644.2392673715437
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth.	8371.606543138529
Something green it would have to be: spinach, say.	8747.944330406575
Then with those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.	9849.216778278362
At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest.	14364.868770999146
Surfeit.	19456.598729469286
Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents.	16667.347011617076
First sweet then savoury.	12026.020676764052
Mr Bloom coasted warily.	4063.0718415484
Ruminants.	19456.598729469286
Their upper jaw they move.	11070.14375436591
Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his?	11571.465017444636
Wasting time explaining it to Flynn ’ s mouth.	12611.04748571848
Lean people long mouths.	14932.412306617945
Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free.	11147.497660831217
Course then you ’ d have all the cranks pestering.	10617.158925690374
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars: Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M ’ invitasti.	11951.745056141594
Feel better.	6517.906706004148
Burgundy.	15443.024084639697
Good pick me up.	5637.9303887560645

Some chap in the blues.	10425.030865372646
Dutch courage.	15707.401234162855
That _Kilkenny People_ in the national library now I must.	8931.541498198525
Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts.	13366.712125406777
They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes.	12948.655111296317
But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show.	8005.003585703252
— _A cenar <URL> What does that _teco_ mean?	7945.821334150388
Tonight perhaps.	9167.132593790095
Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited To come to supper tonight, The rum the rumdum.	13664.893957673577
Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to.	12085.200346341855

Three Hynes owes me.	5779.2590612358235
Two eleven.	6029.269333460617

If I get Billy Prescott ’ s ad: two fifteen.	9130.628850252077
Five guineas about.	7187.444086071878
On the pig ’ s back.	3808.6995225878827
Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.	11345.221700516362
Today.	9940.351240891207
Not think.	4129.279991024192
Tour the south then.	11131.83886899014
What about English wateringplaces?	6292.70549800194
Brighton, Margate.	18227.769584130605
Piers by moonlight.	18227.659305286463
Her voice floating out.	5534.179128827422
Those lovely seaside girls.	5868.516340982267
Against John Long ’ s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle.	12269.876752503067
Handy man wants job.	13303.736415385622
Small wages.	15707.401234162882
Will eat anything.	8107.200004642671
Mr Bloom turned at Gray ’ s confectioner ’ s window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan ’ s bookstore.	10469.481505291751
_Why I left the church of Rome?	12849.246014806817
Birds ’ <URL> Women run him.	8904.509222739971
They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.	10404.611672469646
Same bait.	11107.817728783746
No tram in sight.	8000.161501776659
Wants to cross.	9915.770244408144
— Do you want to cross?	2620.4687773081805
Mr Bloom asked.	890.7170653928929
The blind stripling did not answer.	5293.915025421794
His wallface frowned weakly.	7539.846473125008
He moved his head uncertainly.	6055.190293676863
— You ’ re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said.	1496.033313683724
Molesworth street is opposite.	14932.487582743639
Do you want to cross?	4144.63452420726
There ’ s nothing in the way.	2986.3481992211628
The cane moved out trembling to the left.	6375.784026681493
Mr Bloom ’ s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks ’ van drawn up before Drago ’ s.	6007.193145980123
Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was.	6470.256048274888
Horse drooping.	16878.573427268955
Driver in John Long ’ s.	6067.464503407467
Slaking his drouth.	15868.291085891758
— There ’ s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it ’ s not moving.	2525.995732045059
I ’ ll see you across.	2204.3874546184916
— Yes, the stripling answered.	2359.372295906601
South Frederick street.	7342.013586751305
— Come, Mr Bloom said.	682.5372795094288
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.	11114.470791929132
Say something to him.	4385.599817207161
Better not do the condescending.	10333.641428684332
They mistrust what you tell them.	6109.968384114069
Pass a common remark.	13303.468192195103
— The rain kept off.	2759.2053559954056
No answer.	3422.1802004183505
Stains on his coat.	12359.046110922662
Slobbers his food, I suppose.	9007.519472011627
Tastes all different for him.	6254.279248648208
Have to be spoonfed first.	7316.906792644088
Like a child ’ s hand, his hand.	4647.60855541771
Like Milly ’ s was.	5530.456569855954
Sensitive.	16997.075953601572
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.	11838.973329491071
Wonder if he has a name.	5712.334332536804
Van.	16997.075953601572
Keep his cane clear of the horse ’ s legs: tired drudge get his doze.	13530.176441340083
That ’ s right.	934.1282262040546
Behind a bull: in front of a horse.	9576.461745896866
— Thanks, sir.	1252.268172065128
Knows I ’ m a man.	4029.044947686482
Voice.	19456.598729469286
— Right now?	2318.8398457694398
First turn to the left.	7136.393607982583
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.	8827.794396686531
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed.	9360.224431277778
Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?	12135.868542541175
Must have felt it.	3663.092160812238
See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume.	12674.566628201512
Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.	11109.340520134612
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed.	12477.721400152723
Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.	11523.566715556026
Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn ’ t that cane?	10712.099354963173
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.	11797.19703669995
Penrose! That was that chap ’ s name.	8862.300324194744
Look at all the things they can learn to do.	7617.103545439703
Read with their fingers.	10356.113668705828
Tune pianos.	18679.07077551165
Or we are surprised they have any brains.	11491.852705109157
Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.	11603.497461259527
Of course the other senses are more.	7088.669494967056
Embroider.	19456.598729469286
Plait baskets.	18679.07077551165
People ought to help.	13048.476570766588
Workbasket I could buy for Molly ’ s birthday.	13379.123188062988
Hates sewing.	18679.07077551165
Might take an objection.	11078.579166353487
Dark men they call them.	7475.190468455738
Sense of smell must be stronger too.	11243.711173069587
Smells on all sides, bunched together.	11680.90857968151
Then the spring, the summer: smells.	8951.628791096513
Tastes?	15443.024084639697
They say you can ’ t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head.	7673.726170375443
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.	10293.100437066536
And with a woman, for instance.	4416.282051846938
More shameless not seeing.	12553.871415848624
That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air.	6722.501180029888
Look at me.	2585.7947831285405
I have them all on.	3014.9699570267494
Must be strange not to see her.	4906.432616274747
Kind of a form in his mind ’ s eye.	7394.773097704348
The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves.	10773.359393131586
His hands on her hair, for instance.	6079.498931217798
Say it was black, for instance.	8033.682046861741
Good.	3567.3665975662016
We call it black.	6912.523871714772
Then passing over her white skin.	8929.530151123023
Different feel perhaps.	9737.461452755491
Feeling of white.	12963.082399223162
Postoffice.	15443.024084639697
Fag today.	9658.476403004162
Send her a postal order two shillings, half a crown.	11769.26202369263
Accept my little present.	12192.632418828025
Stationer ’ s just here too.	9642.901376473825
Wait.	1316.9653973396455
Think over it.	3985.3520362968047
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears.	10820.116319255287
Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek.	10864.43783833812
Downy hair there too.	8666.385193110746
Not smooth enough.	6392.48186053848
The belly is the smoothest.	7478.702671629721
No - one about.	2807.6868744027497
There he goes into Frederick street.	4671.2433257572975
Perhaps to Levenston ’ s dancing academy piano.	12525.474758684953
Might be settling my braces.	9462.384492465852
Walking by Doran ’ s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly.	15077.708845642486
But I know it ’ s whitey yellow.	5761.996872002459
Want to try in the dark to see.	5198.171240606574
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.	6261.798990713591
Poor fellow! Quite a boy.	8301.00032171464
Terrible.	14336.178182593083
What dreams would he have, not seeing?	9578.421820430342
Life a dream for him.	5412.9525637176985
Where is the justice being born that way?	8109.724728936787
All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York.	9641.766646612421
Holocaust.	19456.598729469286
Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.	13218.25577281526
Dear, dear, dear.	8650.322890019985
Pity, of course: but somehow you can ’ t cotton on to them someway.	10789.45727062161
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons ’ hall.	11685.074463490322
Solemn as Troy.	14632.276751995785
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace.	12029.584199321114
Old legal cronies cracking a magnum.	12244.316053539786
Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school.	15158.796300437596
I sentenced him to ten years.	6245.579785418612
I suppose he ’ d turn up his nose at that stuff I drank.	7783.83360268363
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle.	13670.623571575376
Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder ’ s court.	12715.348233873596
Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime.	15420.607873133418
Sends them to the rightabout.	14711.861069743
The devil on moneylenders.	5834.625074029063
Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling.	16704.70321440496
Now he ’ s really what they call a dirty jew.	7991.719233018876
Power those judges have.	10797.46712749784
Crusty old topers in wigs.	17724.87334026543
Bear with a sore paw.	13740.236168199557
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.	5898.313537080454
Hello, placard.	11090.86917534185
His Excellency the lord lieutenant.	6028.794160209827
Sixteenth.	19456.598729469286
Today it is.	4420.206263181291
In aid of funds for Mercer ’ s hospital.	7740.796369938879
_The Messiah_ was first given for that.	7508.642782187029
Yes.	804.865728120872
Handel.	19456.598729469286
What about going out there: Ballsbridge.	8300.466502054162
No use sticking to him like a leech.	8458.706477328024
Wear out my welcome.	14553.80505675568
Sure to know someone on the gate.	11458.09329444107
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street.	3564.8812249836724
First I must.	7214.30836088074
Library.	19456.598729469286
Straw hat in sunlight.	16761.404123163316
Tan shoes.	15707.401234162855
Turnedup trousers.	12492.203193407448
It is.	949.4594240553477
It is.	949.4594240553477
His heart quopped softly.	7047.3703717350245
To the right.	2688.006469713594
Museum.	16997.075953601605
Goddesses.	19456.598729469286
He swerved to the right.	2934.7163097913026
Is it?	2436.5708832017426
Almost certain.	14855.255256694101
Wine in my face.	8632.85929334165
Why did I?	3090.430761761787
Too heady.	9838.938135192795
Yes, it is.	1089.3347049765061
The walk.	2692.1286454866677
Not see.	3207.445379620497
Get on.	4301.39681826466
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.	11785.197628845306
Handsome building.	15707.401234162882
Sir Thomas Deane designed.	11791.711066379763
Not following me?	5170.984553620542
Didn ’ t see me perhaps.	4266.062662125873
Light in his eyes.	4597.325894238146
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs.	9408.838581616592
Quick.	7721.979191697367
Cold statues: quiet there.	8784.631566143404
Safe in a minute.	7646.734548973896
No. Didn ’ t see me.	2494.436328910778
After two.	5605.222170282913
Just at the gate.	6630.673214879579
My heart! His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone.	11396.791651040512
Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.	13201.659011406082
Look for something I.	6500.295031634022
Where did I?	3753.889537482719
Busy looking.	13208.796798932159
He thrust back quick Agendath.	7082.073948416487
Afternoon she said.	3214.513502811144
I am looking for that.	2295.651366923636
Yes, that.	1341.7859522811325
Try all pockets.	10012.94165993527
Handker.	19456.598729469286
Trousers.	13490.860194508374
Potato.	16997.075953601572
Purse.	19456.598729469286
Where?	1599.242359848175
Hurry.	10940.661888558341
Walk quietly.	9069.426720598196
Moment more.	8651.450885179143
My heart.	3608.4506910240243
His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap lotion have to call tepid paper stuck.	11494.060518020086
Ah soap there I yes.	7940.37559111184
Gate.	19456.598729469286
Safe! Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred: — And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.	13053.070385648443
A great poet on a great brother poet.	9171.744489182493
A hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.	11359.249353493404
He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.	10837.995373251379
A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck.	11514.314470780824
— Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering.	7737.920706509601
The beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts.	10450.135285192348
One always feels that Goethe ’ s judgments are so true.	11615.940379903324

— Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare ’ s Hamlet though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.	12569.456018653298
— All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his shadow.	7859.532194174525
I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.	8409.180231107091

The supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring.	11386.178857772546
The painting of Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas.	9496.574129356612

Wall, tarnation strike me! — The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.	12815.158336955388
Aristotle was once Plato ’ s schoolboy.	15083.798792124457
— And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said.	5556.593423188198
One can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.	9952.241957104212
He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.	6759.217012807622

Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light.	8618.699930442663
He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.	10394.341559076394
— That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet ’ s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato ’ s.	8270.786096532227
John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth: — Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.	13797.532072101298
— Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?	9811.55502893923

Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.	9890.01788081919
— Haines is gone, he said.	1566.331407422169
— Is he?	1354.2996143480568
— I was showing him Jubainville ’ s book.	4429.0782228412445
He ’ s quite enthusiastic, don ’ t you know, about Hyde ’ s _Lovesongs of <URL> I couldn ’ t bring him in to hear the discussion.	5181.495736554836

France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer ’ s Phæacians.	15735.107912724143
From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.	9655.459038425992
— Mallarmé, don ’ t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris.	5575.72123687503
The one about <URL> He says: _il se promène, lisant au livre de lui - même_, don ’ t you know, _reading the book of himself_.	8391.873682287356
He describes _Hamlet_ given in a French town, don ’ t you know, a provincial town.	5634.5881578046465
They advertised it.	2828.520899999341
His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.	8475.056748509478
_Hamlet ou Le Distrait Pièce de Shakespeare_ He repeated to John Eglinton ’ s newgathered frown: — _Pièce de Shakespeare_, don ’ t you know.	8562.559602386944
It ’ s so French.	2603.402922475086
The French point of view.	6389.895583647195
_Hamlet ou_...	2968.9128113983525
— The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.	5363.3069390844375
John Eglinton laughed.	5756.231387493247
— Yes, I suppose it would be, he said.	1291.7996556412654
Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.	15376.621206677664
Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.	16112.477388603033
— A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said.	3780.036449302478
Not for nothing was he a butcher ’ s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms.	11152.427607858306
Nine lives are taken off for his father ’ s one.	8347.578463636231

Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp.	14058.877875234553
The devil and the deep sea.	5372.221049967185
— He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best ’ s behoof.	8715.081477278214
Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.	12467.16756392865
List! List! O List! My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.	16611.216006615294
If thou didst ever...	2885.7554867045974
— What is a ghost?	2544.9379069727856
Stephen said with tingling energy.	7457.3585120855405
One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners.	13642.454887401213
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin.	14855.711028526208
Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_, returning to the world that has forgotten him?	9057.732194803048
Who is King Hamlet?	7024.629791772105
John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.	11801.503574837045
Lifted.	19456.598729469286
— It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a swift glance their hearing.	7680.212565799487

Work in all you know.	8229.34827829068
Make them accomplices.	12536.44797527997
— Shakespeare has left the huguenot ’ s house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank.	10624.561837349596
But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes.	11183.29470730199
The swan of Avon has other thoughts.	7643.755707769925
Composition of place.	11185.338321324165
A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice.	11147.737471134013
It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre.	11408.83052241829
He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name: Hamlet, I am thy father ’ s spirit, bidding him list.	11262.245461722427
To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.	11397.615156699574
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son ’ s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet ’ s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?	12755.715694880968
— But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.	10049.617225572874
Art thou there, truepenny?	16057.581315418494
— Interesting only to the parish clerk.	7306.474640445539
I mean, we have the plays.	4889.072566683717
I mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the poet lived?	10828.694213185518
As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l ’ Isle has said.	9144.991034299077
Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet ’ s drinking, the poet ’ s debts.	11825.554657221033
We have _King Lear_: and it is immortal.	10071.327446722093
Mr Best ’ s face, appealed to, agreed.	6117.267401455873
Flow over them with your waves and with your waters, Mananaan, Mananaan MacLir...	9819.387734552476

John Eglinton ’ s carping voice asked.	5862.250160947969
Her ghost at least has been laid for ever.	9720.36438940901
She died, for literature at least, before she was born.	9332.03304874668
— She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born.	7241.455228862664
She saw him into and out of the world.	3518.672086922877
She took his first embraces.	7206.439707359716
She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.	12646.20590430014

_Liliata <URL> I wept alone.	12803.498930320991
John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.	11247.504092860649
— The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.	6223.664572635902
— Bosh! Stephen said rudely.	7555.528541398129
A man of genius makes no mistakes.	7448.699791934763
His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.	11828.05541086198
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.	15426.438762764543
— A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine.	9278.313356161416
What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?	10495.011547250431
— Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world.	7384.773388261936
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit nomen! _), Socratididion ’ s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know.	11334.685242095948
But neither the midwife ’ s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.	13237.83513347471
Mr Best ’ s quiet voice said forgetfully.	7794.5814280258055
Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.	7940.684257121659
His look went from brooder ’ s beard to carper ’ s skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned.	14352.317137744532
— He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.	4465.534190017977
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling _The girl I left behind <URL> If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows.	14025.36786730987
That memory, _Venus and Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light - of - love in London.	12056.529176636639
Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured?	11327.524156434167
Hortensio calls her young and beautiful.	16702.87220582263
Do you think the writer of _Antony and Cleopatra_, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal?	12160.342217369558
Good: he left her and gained the world of men.	9881.787231175542
But his boywomen are the women of a boy.	7632.144336840531
Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males.	13320.861476135393
He chose badly?	5472.076278193412
He was chosen, it seems to me.	2779.7123969457425
If others have their will Ann hath a way.	8922.64478422812
By cock, she was to blame.	8523.638055012087
She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix.	9077.175089616543
The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.	13153.579386849437
And my turn?	5379.077645643834
When?	3339.744108939042
Come! — Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.	11709.778194794226
He murmured then with blond delight for all: Between the acres of the rye These pretty countryfolk would lie.	12417.483563843854
Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.	16062.772771193308
A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its cooperative watch.	10556.100444460651

Piper is coming.	10792.390552205818
— Piper! Mr Best piped.	7553.589862124383
Is Piper back?	8478.079848022802
Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.	15372.770060665502

Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers.	17932.704941932887
_Isis <URL> Their Pali book we tried to pawn.	17280.552880941003
Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot he thrones an Aztec logos, functioning on astral levels, their oversoul, mahamahatma.	16900.92406633211
The faithful hermetists await the light, ripe for chelaship, ringroundabout him.	8218.445443871691

Caulfield Irwin.	18679.07077551165
Lotus ladies tend them i ’ the eyes, their pineal glands aglow.	16180.542620793802
Filled with his god, he thrones, Buddh under plantain.	17184.845020275705
Gulfer of souls, engulfer.	17725.332931751607
Hesouls, shesouls, shoals of souls.	14058.830621361223
Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled, whirling, they bewail.	17163.82040873669
In quintessential triviality For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt.	12227.496710453053
— They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said, friendly and earnest.	8343.664766258686
Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets ’ verses.	11727.43935037854
We are all looking forward anxiously.	7029.473502096531
Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.	16648.62373058795
See this.	5254.071595102357
Remember.	7139.47612196162
Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his ashplanthandle over his knee.	11700.819714961315
Touch lightly with two index fingers.	11487.003128569198
Aristotle ’ s experiment.	12587.87115105019
One or two?	8982.138254415619
Necessity is that in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise.	15576.913677689117
Argal, one hat is one hat.	13185.202188661555
Listen.	5813.562960239262
Young Colum and Starkey.	12269.751945584874
George Roberts is doing the commercial part.	13337.463080892565
Longworth will give it a good puff in the <URL> O, will he?	12405.656566002897
I liked Colum ’ s <URL> Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius.	8772.601892609566
Do you think he has genius really?	6727.685733251247
Yeats admired his line: _As in wild earth a Grecian vase_.	17116.052075911473
Did he?	3035.308241955686
I hope you ’ ll be able to come tonight.	4744.730566121088
Malachi Mulligan is coming too.	10071.05044691426
Moore asked him to bring Haines.	13844.818002516246
Did you hear Miss Mitchell ’ s joke about Moore and Martyn?	11272.103942395752
That Moore is Martyn ’ s wild oats?	10199.89515745681
Awfully clever, isn ’ t it?	5127.244882521248
Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says.	12112.971977990384
Moore is the man for it.	6853.228565992792
A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin.	7436.253189185202
With a saffron kilt?	7014.879203830424
O ’ Neill Russell?	3825.019351154553
O, yes, he must speak the grand old tongue.	6537.704401614695
And his Dulcinea?	4924.173367086401
James Stephens is doing some clever sketches.	14115.897492590648
We are becoming important, it seems.	6515.627822380603
Cordelia.	19456.598729469286
<URL> Lir ’ s loneliest daughter.	10953.019413299391
Nookshotten.	19456.598729469286
Now your best French polish.	11327.622058589763
— Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising.	4326.794014007241
— O, yes.	683.6616997952798
If he considers it important it will go in.	7343.22621310899
We have so much correspondence.	8036.0200699666975
— I understand, Stephen said.	864.753369674183
Thanks.	5948.990215451002
God ild you.	4672.3933901145865
The pigs ’ paper.	4426.14672089038
Bullockbefriending.	16997.075953601572
Synge has promised me an article for _Dana_ too.	11201.592827400682
Are we going to be read?	9418.704820742814
I feel we are.	3176.157863005841
The Gaelic league wants something in Irish.	7892.5632622023795
I hope you will come round tonight.	5317.331373232554
Bring Starkey.	12340.567951090554
Stephen sat down.	4785.457380412849
The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers.	6494.574576209484
Blushing, his mask said: — Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.	12382.196475113506
He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low: — Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?	11024.642964327537
Alarmed face asks me.	8860.92466307415
Why did he come?	4706.948165348959
Courtesy or an inward light?	16727.932234562355
— Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.	5642.683161593288
— Yes.	427.3278064178512
Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.	17342.44758495263
Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully tapsters ’ wives.	13455.272922241262
Fox and geese.	13083.224889498386
And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.	14225.481337698837
— Yes.	427.3278064178512
So you think...	2138.6437617593488
The door closed behind the outgoer.	6709.980184870356
Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.	14089.797171096932
A vestal ’ s lamp.	6617.783420779682
Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.	14294.92328847303
Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.	13679.548272003356
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned.	17235.31338599476
And I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest.	6857.736360458583
_In painted chambers loaded with <URL> They are still.	13322.228038403942
Once quick in the brains of men.	10263.403268228982
Still: but an itch of death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.	13354.88783258774
— Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic.	8233.901378261113
We know nothing but that he lived and suffered.	10167.275870883537
Not even so much.	6128.154066141636
Others abide our question.	13498.071527504078
A shadow hangs over all the rest.	5973.514568354924
— But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn ’ t it?	3662.2496366758787
Mr Best pleaded.	4818.385070128749
I mean, a kind of private paper, don ’ t you know, of his private life.	3757.0484157870333
I mean, I don ’ t care a button, don ’ t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...	3242.8340455396615
His private papers in the original.	7539.782304286557
_Ta an bad ar an tir.	17570.648302713715
Taim in mo shagart_.	17932.61452774436
Put beurla on it, littlejohn.	12990.963930908414
Quoth littlejohn Eglinton: — I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.	12967.89060830237
Bear with me.	5466.98432950989
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows.	12394.168175622824
A basilisk.	4762.787687825449
_E quando vede l ’ uomo l ’ attosca_.	16655.27188660768
Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.	11490.486520869368
— As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image.	9966.408015056637
And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth.	12051.83156224654
In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be.	11006.80236266247
So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.	11650.274096790406
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.	16006.271863322227
— Yes, Mr Best said youngly.	2444.558586161195
I feel Hamlet quite young.	4921.2980439683115
The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.	10320.927107436184
Has the wrong sow by the lug.	12837.303911324441
He is in my father.	3551.2510489082833
— That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.	4036.474088529441
John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.	11117.618311456132
— If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market.	7234.732686385756
The plays of Shakespeare ’ s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.	10358.291313119573
— The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.	5818.563452068131
— There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.	5992.8373458897495
Said that.	6290.3666042657915
— If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, _ look to see when and how the shadow lifts.	11973.374297576962
What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?	12058.351909204266
Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.	15446.53700111827
— A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.	7405.831405160755
— The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected.	9161.195545307559
The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.	9191.973788773135
Good Bacon: gone musty.	11131.094344021754
Shakespeare Bacon ’ s wild oats.	13968.183090411481
Cypherjugglers going the highroads.	17932.88576347237
Seekers on the great quest.	16773.12465855217
What town, good masters?	7824.959645279705
Mummed in names: A.	11309.945964942684
East of the sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n - og_.	13405.22047164029
Booted the twain and staved.	17724.87334026543
How many miles to Dublin?	8319.10070123351
Three score and ten, sir.	4578.980033234155
Will we be there by candlelight?	12949.307010009217
— Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.	5808.931738749316
— Does he?	2849.116674453871
What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?	10376.632118078915
— Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, that which was lost.	8014.449188431443
What was lost is given back to him: his daughter ’ s child.	9421.289780480642
_My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this <URL> Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?	15723.284736205816
— The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.	7476.697222086538
_L ’ art d ’ être grand_...	6722.579853609689
— Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?	8837.025254786187
Do you know what you are talking about?	4470.335255537711
Such an appeal will touch him.	8165.687073492053
The images of other males of his blood will repel him.	7619.8799556079275
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.	8981.6202603317
— I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public.	7411.044039716378
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw.	10862.012150032639
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris.	16682.958428308033
His articles on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant.	12172.23514039171
Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets.	16299.48336275626
The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke.	9639.365721495107
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk ’ s egg, prize of their fray.	16047.26437638393
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords.	9510.700227981071
Dost love, Miriam?	14933.466159123238
Dost love thy man?	12434.21928263728
— That may be too, Stephen said.	1809.029390711858
Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life.	12574.601799644977
Why does he send to one who is a _buonaroba, _ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him?	13723.311964258512
He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written _Romeo and Juliet_.	10700.738192102794
Why?	1336.6418951783915
He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down.	10852.092729534692
Assumed dongiovannism will not save him.	9491.815576339868
No later undoing will undo the first undoing.	11138.920838471937
The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding.	11448.133326592408
If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman ’ s invisible weapon.	11081.51149607157
There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself.	11551.49941025885
A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.	10261.989917644316
And in the porches of their ears I pour.	8345.057724867904
— The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear.	8954.167840543638
But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come.	12853.71761413948
The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet ’ s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator.	12459.210487164517
He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.	12764.53200820114
But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed.	13421.998378875543
His beaver is up.	4578.384251848198
He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore ’ s rocks or what you will, the sea ’ s voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.	10864.474619091756
— Amen! was responded from the doorway.	6595.531926024686
Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?	16010.721938216888
_Entr ’ acte_.	18227.54902377354
A ribald face, sullen as a dean ’ s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles.	10542.170908610293
My telegram.	6894.293795334063
— You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not?	6722.447536192225
he asked of Stephen.	5139.214196270605
Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.	17132.86202875342
They make him welcome.	5902.752773960615
_Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch <URL> Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.	16959.302833421698
He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.	14723.1456175797
He lifts his hands.	2818.7854959303563
Veils fall.	13208.796798932159
O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.	8888.298360157205
— Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said.	2129.9029140033927
A most instructive discussion.	6004.428190423018
Mr Mulligan, I ’ ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare.	7386.001361973645
All sides of life should be represented.	10935.810408102843
He smiled on all sides equally.	6294.217201523435
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled: — Shakespeare?	9202.874600462075
he said.	497.15978922676095
I seem to know the name.	4566.502921906741
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.	10520.936074412664
— To be sure, he said, remembering brightly.	3543.958270013472
The chap that writes like Synge.	8254.521421890437
Mr Best turned to him.	2625.4990177872814
— Haines missed you, he said.	1450.625745483924
Did you meet him?	5399.471082337692
He ’ ll see you after at the D.	4066.2524360274138
B.	1761.314203247806
C.	957.8630399978279
He ’ s gone to Gill ’ s to buy Hyde ’ s _Lovesongs of Connacht_.	5468.091769066314
— I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said.	2214.8075996172784
I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.	8833.272530815371
Vining held that the prince was a woman.	10569.73960112412
Has no - one made him out to be an Irishman?	10425.998435836738
Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues.	14257.561607419528
— The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde ’ s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook.	7402.704274418413
<URL> where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.	13677.572446686665
— For Willie Hughes, is it not?	4808.248555330038
the quaker librarian asked.	4842.6164213723105
Or Hughie Wills?	9175.155872417936
Mr William Himself.	7208.85805307247
W.	4493.51389505916
H.: who am I?	8993.857460433152
— I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.	6549.1103180145465
Of course it ’ s all paradox, don ’ t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it ’ s so typical the way he works it out.	5688.272361578501
It ’ s the very essence of Wilde, don ’ t you know.	2058.2889909474106
The light touch.	4236.128531605051
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.	12322.417428256625
Tame essence of Wilde.	16761.319611953484
You ’ re darned witty.	4115.999210410925
Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy ’ s ducats.	13917.70485676406
How much did I spend?	8319.567938620685
O, a few shillings.	4130.953019970102
For a plump of pressmen.	9481.31881485537
Humour wet and dry.	13957.009614406054
Wit.	19456.598729469286
You would give your five wits for youth ’ s proud livery he pranks in.	9748.543910453905
Lineaments of gratified desire.	15976.304393411037
Take her for me.	4924.370918060369
In pairing time.	3687.9973271655936
Jove, a cool ruttime send them.	10896.283224765542
Yea, turtledove her.	8341.693254490554
Eve.	16997.075953601605
Naked wheatbellied sin.	12441.952512840195
A snake coils her, fang in ’ s kiss.	9369.745013355458
— Do you think it is only a paradox?	4899.896878418132
the quaker librarian was asking.	9102.11671287368
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.	10050.64473351568
They talked seriously of mocker ’ s seriousness.	11033.701639218583
Buck Mulligan ’ s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile.	6877.232540110261
Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket.	8331.197755087234
His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.	10114.977978015326
— Telegram! he said.	1326.563269505474
Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull! He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully: — _The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing <URL> Signed: Dedalus.	12995.756713878687
Where did you launch it from?	8117.276367431431
The kips?	4122.464502427211
No. College Green.	5288.327848096801
Have you drunk the four quid?	8461.256693664402
Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street.	11470.419229910543
O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite! Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue: — It ’ s what I ’ m telling you, mister honey, it ’ s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in.	9243.636031461787
’ Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I ’ m thinking, and he limp with leching.	10693.128539461079
And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery ’ s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.	12918.797470223803
He wailed: — And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.	13023.134680282796
Stephen laughed.	4687.053391457083
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.	10890.103319011829
— The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you.	3264.152572813867
He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule.	8927.387277476833
He ’ s out in pampooties to murder you.	2969.103404585157
— Me! Stephen exclaimed.	5772.468544414182
That was your contribution to literature.	6907.815680919913
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.	10275.897560850868
— Murder you! he laughed.	6104.255307435002
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint - André - des - Arts.	16854.998951540267
In words of words for words, palabras.	11170.739581960946
Oisin with Patrick.	15868.291080083476
Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing a winebottle.	17216.20529408356
_C ’ est vendredi saint! _ Murthering Irish.	15646.298010063654
His image, wandering, he met.	9568.175558376308
I mine.	2698.9206119339547
I met a fool i ’ the forest.	7858.0071168344775
— Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.	7686.328036764053
—...	369.623385050028
in which everyone can find his own.	11793.514390284266
So Mr Justice Madden in his _Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms...	8417.096309705807
Yes?	3234.8076811919955
What is it?	768.6383175649803
— There ’ s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card.	5298.597006413988
From the <URL> He wants to see the files of the _Kilkenny People_ for last year.	9337.955635398432
— Certainly, certainly, certainly.	5262.774835608181
Is the gentleman?...	2155.5028065370348
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked: — Is he?...	7415.813363162263
O, there! Brisk in a galliard he was off, out.	7800.959022036347
In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.	12835.192215745152
— This gentleman?	3930.487777624426
Kilkenny People? _ To be sure.	12751.378939473045
Good day, sir.	2012.5916459177947
_Kilkenny_...	2283.9600119469565
We have certainly...	1822.6230728382131
A patient silhouette waited, listening.	6613.252284909071
— All the leading provincial...	2161.5816706729565
_Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian, _ <NUM>...	8039.960042631039
Will you please?...	2350.3349466179457

This way...	1913.1209393580925
Please, sir...	1765.4103268651343
The door closed.	3400.598726401152
— The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.	3073.345774216046
He jumped up and snatched the card.	7330.889007558017
— What ’ s his name?	1177.9962732555086
Bloom.	1055.12144237401
He rattled on: — Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more.	8419.16712446759
I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite.	10423.794142510138
The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer.	9319.222060406742
Every day we must do homage to her.	8064.612607080927
_Life of life, thy lips <URL> Suddenly he turned to Stephen: — He knows you.	10467.059826113138
He knows your old fellow.	3717.602111517161
O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks.	6619.9439824552865
His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.	11473.07295467416
Venus Kallipyge.	14855.255256694101
O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the maiden hid_.	9463.987789482546
— We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best ’ s approval.	8114.742263472232
We begin to be interested in Mrs S.	7831.071177032403
Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.	13990.253732398005
— Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus ’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope.	10509.607111563924
Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland.	12169.454961974041
His life was rich.	7910.286155493071
His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit.	10341.30393801302
Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies.	15964.6645699162
Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays.	13381.174271353688
The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba.	11414.750269803368
Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.	14275.059849454152
You know Manningham ’ s story of the burgher ’ s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon ’ s blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_.	14000.760161455224
And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.	11278.645208599277
Cours la Reine.	18227.54902377354
_Encore vingt sous.	16807.8688531982
Minette?	19456.598729469286
Tu veux? _ — The height of fine society.	15716.412673753108
And sir William Davenant of Oxford ’ s mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.	11981.815701795224
Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed: — Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock! — And Harry of six wives ’ daughter.	10986.535041008488
And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings.	11137.240416227192
But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?	12337.244962626382
Do and do.	5605.435441549968
Thing done.	10257.54006705099
In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn.	10112.062594191857
An azured harebell like her veins.	11144.289987898372
Lids of Juno ’ s eyes, violets.	15045.608888132487
He walks.	3750.728011825402
One life is all.	4342.842101791915
One body.	4111.656965936613
Do. But do.	5122.468492423687
Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.	14478.177524230246
Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton ’ s desk sharply.	7481.545325625851
— Whom do you suspect?	6374.64300269497
he challenged.	8579.278802260933
— Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets.	7547.580586095776
Once spurned twice spurned.	13498.003490640338
But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.	9039.812010878068
Love that dare not speak its name.	7538.26123084753
— As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.	9708.90229764936
Old wall where sudden lizards flash.	11639.243823463548
— It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion.	8563.876603720093
Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife.	9961.189651462344
But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow.	11073.964782467992
Two deeds are rank in that ghost ’ s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband ’ s brother.	12233.824395444231
Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood.	12533.564689623696
Once a wooer, twice a wooer.	14440.883274915164
Stephen turned boldly in his chair.	7343.255589385608
— The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning.	6434.066258125056
If you deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him.	11554.642468442607
All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan ’ s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy ’ s words, wed her second, having killed her first.	12030.401781417686
O, yes, mention there is.	3195.4739625740744
In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father ’ s shepherd.	10932.084111951342
Explain you then.	8563.18047236439
Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.	15996.739799545727
He faced their silence.	4189.6404642526495
To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.	9823.753375418042
She was entitled to her widow ’ s dower At common law.	8859.2882735573
His legal knowledge was great Our judges tell us.	8892.512059670657
Him Satan fleers, Mocker: And therefore he left out her name From the first draft but he did not leave out The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters, For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford And in London.	15299.451257411089
<URL> Leftherhis Secondbest Leftherhis Bestabed Secabest Leftabed.	13439.963644518888
Woa! — Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.	14388.23601151118
— He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer.	9504.27475457362
Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?	11366.907802861742
— It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.	10295.523327164377
— _Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.	9344.959715458665
— Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.	9590.187326975412
Let me think.	4221.178498570623
— Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don ’ t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.	12442.500799975538
— Do you mean he died so?	3529.4301974052337
Mr Best asked with slight concern.	7649.815853845608
I mean...	679.0566452050947
— He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped.	5587.092852322296
A quart of ale is a dish for a king.	9317.209984185482
O, I must tell you what Dowden said! — What?	5006.918789704768
asked Besteglinton.	13656.980144780464
William Shakespeare and company, limited.	14159.419898456787
The people ’ s William.	6727.910069094037
Dowden, Highfield house...	4560.953935873924
— Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously.	6588.9681321456965
I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard.	9827.744275560775
He lifted his hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those <URL> Lovely! Catamite.	10458.549508266049
— The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton.	9327.275255061879
Steadfast John replied severe: — The doctor can tell us what those words mean.	13868.872562666897
You cannot eat your cake and have it.	6145.050214684863
Sayest thou so?	11881.845346194077
Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?	11908.122030567314
— And the sense of property, Stephen said.	1914.3526669567757
He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket.	4838.471544779667
The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots.	12432.982805438434
His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.	13390.154195698484
He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent.	13081.076657123263
How else could Aubrey ’ s ostler and callboy get rich quick?	12643.058176560557
All events brought grist to his mill.	10456.589939328267
Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen ’ s leech Lopez, his jew ’ s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting.	14994.216267764798
The lost armada is his jeer in _Love ’ s Labour Lost_.	10466.388723498088
His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm.	12882.071300901216
Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter ’ s theory of equivocation.	15309.118266704561
The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin.	12762.763501422474
The sugared sonnets follow Sidney ’ s.	3836.4305536687784
As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.	14531.531233949367
I think you ’ re getting on very nicely.	5379.075775709963
Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological.	11464.201024029853
_Mingo, minxi, mictum, <URL> — Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly.	10288.141879644321
Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.	10480.729956177414
_Sufflaminandus <URL> — He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals.	14266.304952696551
— A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded.	5216.194323127847
Coleridge called him myriadminded.	17933.33777744139
_Amplius.	12971.327416137423
In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter <URL> — Saint Thomas, Stephen began...	8015.883697154573
— _Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.	9307.728043107998
There he keened a wailing rune.	8479.17869935776
— _Pogue mahone! Acushla machree! _ It ’ s destroyed we are from this day! It ’ s destroyed we are surely! All smiled their smiles.	9194.894919033293
— Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions.	12859.949594543887
He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it.	10071.289219220447
Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage.	16963.242275626646
Accusations are made in anger.	16727.859951945873
The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel.	12986.203774884256
Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet.	16319.317301321948
But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife.	10475.814075917991
No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.	13250.444538706079
— Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.	6540.992392470455
— Which will?	4109.848615584937
gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan.	13609.503525590737
We are getting mixed.	5933.502277286959
— The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will ’ s widow, is the will to die.	8345.001205072433
_ — Requiescat! _ Stephen prayed.	7121.270470416389
What of all the will to do?	5937.959257839414

— Why?	1291.71792970544
Stephen answered himself.	5040.422494981689
Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him.	11983.911836090942
The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book.	13010.029573029455
It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.	11803.989696864148
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.	12814.922380009482
But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil.	11388.313717780225

Beauty and peace have not done it away.	11392.183065471616
It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_, twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet, _ in _Measure for Measure_ — and in all the other plays which I have not read.	12322.076092924406

After God Shakespeare has created most.	11561.064837099158
— Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said.	4000.228222641988
He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth.	11960.19534478275

If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa ’ s lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go.	13102.750311915968

The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.	13175.660368974677

he said.	497.15978922676095
The Lord has spoken to Malachi.	7361.3245680694135
He began to scribble on a slip of paper.	5576.244800594653
Take some slips from the counter going out.	8916.854837664536
— Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall live.	10630.097732600067
The rest shall keep as they are.	5423.34093935455
He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.	10240.450619974778
Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his variorum edition of _The Taming of the <URL> — You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen.	13612.601169810814
You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle.	10916.364996451994
Do you believe your own theory?	8201.163464855752
— No, Stephen said promptly.	2110.6728301241997
— Are you going to write it?	2282.9129090825973
Mr Best asked.	2347.6280675842145
You ought to make it a dialogue, don ’ t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.	5537.57683932111
John Eclecticon doubly smiled.	9116.144111110118
— Well, in that case, he said, I don ’ t see why you should expect payment for it since you don ’ t believe it yourself.	4607.663256188336
Dowden believes there is some mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more.	12681.321529834315
Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument.	16079.35184047005
It will come as a surprise to his grace.	10483.251518909603
But he believes his theory.	6694.737117614191
I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief.	7309.932210547744
That is, help me to believe or help me to unbelieve?	9674.228797854192
Who helps to believe?	9827.645257781205
<URL> Who to unbelieve?	10587.627690189229
Other chap.	7405.435881725319
— You are the only contributor to _Dana_ who asks for pieces of silver.	8175.800162580705
Fred Ryan wants space for an article on economics.	16052.969055189662
Fraidrine.	19456.598729469286
Two pieces of silver he lent me.	7455.531036149379
Tide you over.	9780.655031389617
Economics.	19456.598729469286
— For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.	5445.588512061806
Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice: — I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.	13060.372862257444
He broke away.	2772.152977304804
— Come, Kinch.	1936.9980411195645
Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.	8169.194864258845
Come, Kinch.	3981.3927835011677
You have eaten all we left.	4955.132880902554
Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.	13564.762936704084
Stephen rose.	4412.918569174201
Life is many days.	8254.840806341434
This will end.	6543.471862398703
— We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said.	3875.433311157004
_Notre ami_ Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.	11632.853374946928
Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.	8616.554632866733
— Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland.	5306.1382778535535
I ’ ll be there.	864.6689394758037
Come, Kinch, the bards must drink.	6415.976082175167
Can you walk straight?	8991.730256751585
Laughing, he...	2631.8882113162003
Swill till eleven.	13492.86464334258
Lubber...	2283.9600119469565
Stephen followed a lubber...	2826.8819670023813
One day in the national library we had a discussion.	9056.281126978914
Shakes.	19456.598729469286
After.	7294.126548435002
His lub back: I followed.	9176.18775835421
I gall his kibe.	6828.996811279133
Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.	11282.338058652118
What have I learned?	6220.729958265948
Of them?	5610.994610952632
Of me?	4625.277414935718
Walk like Haines now.	7469.853494933447

The quaker ’ s pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.	10111.630346823169
— O please do, sir...	1371.1373916437756
Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding: — A pleased bottom.	15194.532078590404
The turnstile.	4122.464502427211
Is that?...	1377.5103940628028

Looked?...	1912.581216561621
The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.	8254.458994756533
Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling: John Eglinton, my jo, John, Why won ’ t you wed a wife?	12820.623521172743
He spluttered to the air: — O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton.	8827.285782984382
We went over to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers ’ hall.	10372.032145045705
Our players are creating a new art for Europe like the Greeks or M.	11823.371232527175
Maeterlinck.	16997.075953601572
Abbey Theatre! I smell the pubic sweat of monks.	16645.928339902286
He spat blank.	5472.076278193412
Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him.	12063.853264878459
And left the _femme de trente <URL> And why no other children born?	11680.860138374777

he...	954.3006152811689
— Longworth and M ’ Curdy Atkinson were there...	3726.0836011899073
Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling: I hardly hear the purlieu cry Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by Before my thoughts begin to run On F.	14926.521749694219
M ’ Curdy Atkinson, The same that had the wooden leg And that filibustering filibeg That never dared to slake his drouth, Magee that had the chinless mouth.	12374.859935743121
Jest on.	7919.814622340529
Know thyself.	12198.155126919923
Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me.	10145.048568652936
I halt.	4389.602684722832
— Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned.	6172.707243995413
Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature.	13615.151679241484
Only crows, priests and English coal are black.	12109.53051443203
A laugh tripped over his lips.	4947.347630472374
— Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory.	7998.749132491053
O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.	13489.60767901531
Couldn ’ t you do the Yeats touch?	7277.7406048349785
He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms: — The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.	9731.48230180484
One thinks of Homer.	9942.503439036464
He stopped at the stairfoot.	5541.788555544134
The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined.	8916.573099790883
Gone the nine men ’ s morrice with caps of indices.	13034.63928486667
In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: _Everyman His Own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky <URL> He turned a happy patch ’ s smirk to Stephen, saying: — The disguise, I fear, is thin.	13231.573512867986
But listen.	5319.250415924765
He read, _marcato: _ — Characters: TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole) CRAB (a bushranger) MEDICAL DICK) and) (two birds with one stone) MEDICAL DAVY) MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier) FRESH NELLY and ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).	13043.41594543245
He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men: — O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit! — The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.	10684.880538437812
About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.	12399.24174032629
Part.	14336.178182593083
The moment is now.	3002.643098965165
Where then?	4766.53283696028
If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight.	10164.789888862384
Why?	1336.6418951783915
That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.	12585.441049820636
My will: his will that fronts me.	7947.861766746188
Seas between.	15707.401234162855
A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.	8582.111453225132
— Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.	1658.709167178094
The portico.	4122.464502427211
Here I watched the birds for augury.	12065.404078196198
Ængus of the birds.	12285.80943894092
They go, they come.	6564.156552690547
Last night I flew.	9835.982461727675
Easily flew.	12340.567951090532
Men wondered.	14193.453893600445
Street of harlots after.	8714.150054079073
A creamfruit melon he held to me.	4576.80957882206
In. You will see.	4871.030030937061
— The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown ’ s awe.	6605.482859217465
Did you see his eye?	6503.5088233443275
He looked upon you to lust after you.	5088.365946466239
I fear thee, ancient mariner.	8097.098363929445
O, Kinch, thou art in peril.	6052.907284052947
Get thee a breechpad.	11937.313751103518
Manner of Oxenford.	18227.54902377354
Day.	8684.046856906252
Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.	13659.289682454908
A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.	12004.510700626004
They followed.	4177.953049576884
Speak on.	6659.844457379619
Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street.	10876.088207994018
No birds.	4680.40855470827
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.	14764.003092202112
Cease to strive.	18227.54902377354
Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic: from wide earth an altar.	15408.956250017725
Laud we the gods And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils From our bless ’ d altars.	16279.414539553753
The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.	3751.2855688067084
J.	306.21619418874246
reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps.	15583.506693492067
Five to three.	9143.520749280045
Just nice time to walk to Artane.	11314.994658765068
What was that boy ’ s name again?	5112.351012155042
Dignam.	4031.34645021227
Yes.	804.865728120872
_Vere dignum et iustum <URL> Brother Swan was the person to see.	11370.015965617167
Mr Cunningham ’ s letter.	5361.046433272154
Yes.	804.865728120872
Oblige him, if possible.	14687.87843485962
Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.	8760.028650464303
A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes.	12010.874249597158
He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S.	9617.124877112039
J.	306.21619418874246
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.	9066.405202649741
Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square.	7271.159837537454
He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey ’ s words: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old <URL> He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. — Very well, indeed, father.	13010.22693512521
And you, father?	4814.05188761753
Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed.	6953.995062852369
He would go to Buxton probably for the waters.	7315.371422145918
And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere?	10320.595799615743
Was that so?	5197.532427961995
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.	5416.807291279547
And Mr Sheehy himself?	5778.171375077832
Still in London.	6520.743233736392
The house was still sitting, to be sure it was.	5710.113940968059
Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed.	12927.835465909222
Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach.	8569.623590017793
O, yes: a very great success.	5582.817087993988
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Yes, he would certainly call.	9873.540125399431
— Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.	5456.294273464873
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun.	8513.018886897848
He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.	8600.555975374513
Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s droll eyes and cockney voice.	10595.001551041783
— Pilate! Wy don ’ t you old back that owlin mob?	6576.67940986975
A zealous man, however.	5932.781985287476
Really he was.	7199.668783402616
And really did great good in his way.	6391.194649086981
Beyond a doubt.	11501.362588920438
He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.	4237.6245304964295
Of good family too would one think it?	9035.52235698635
Welsh, were they not?	11878.663014798558
O, lest he forget.	4603.416678952376
That letter to father provincial.	8207.00683455508
Yes: they were from Belvedere.	8967.93492966302
The little house.	3107.168016844352
Aha.	9780.192173045993
And were they good boys at school?	9267.482661362632
O.	898.7620042054172
That was very good now.	3718.82286454279
And what was his name?	3624.8195988801467
Jack Sohan.	14855.255256694101
And his name?	2494.7514359729557
Ger.	19456.598729469286
Gallaher.	16997.075953601572
And the other little man?	4174.374575861251
His name was Brunny Lynam.	7960.183884238465
O, that was a very nice name to have.	4319.931089902352
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.	9400.640833334333
— But mind you don ’ t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.	3979.588217646833
The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed: — O, sir.	4354.022553345826
— Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.	4960.881012024143
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee ’ s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.	13402.649316950243
Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.	10059.31800947223
Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam ’ s court.	11721.17508708916
Was that not Mrs M ’ Guinness?	10282.7761830435
Mrs M ’ Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed.	12809.076228200885
And Father Conmee smiled and saluted.	7144.634551416626
A fine carriage she had.	5803.5857120986275
Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.	9138.646326253363
And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a...	5455.272147036234
what should he say?...	3752.1157198217948
such a queenly mien.	17934.964624563094
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left.	10018.153947869898
The reverend T.	2494.132315826896
R.	3825.639029918304
Greene <URL>. will (<URL>.) speak.	12548.57923752308
The incumbent they called him.	3489.9586193964715
He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words.	6886.762262975795
But one should be charitable.	8299.670641463359
Invincible ignorance.	18679.07077551165
They acted according to their lights.	9062.888779759116
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road.	6758.051577284642
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare.	6895.224058552837
Surely, there ought to be.	8210.429072344274
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.	7684.110602137766
All raised untidy caps.	7768.865246509101
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.	8702.999475367522
Christian brother boys.	15868.195079096857
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.	7721.888801951897
Saint Joseph ’ s church, Portland row.	10294.604041581055
For aged and virtuous females.	9878.923767065862
Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.	7578.129153380172
Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.	17360.6580720104
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman.	11471.681716024723
And now it was an office or something.	5896.287289027486
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.	11256.446312312668
Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.	11336.09112132952
He passed Grogan ’ s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York.	8994.946821499427
In America those things were continually happening.	10694.024529845674
Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.	13092.702655228313
Still, an act of perfect contrition.	9218.802413116666
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin ’ s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged.	11108.296943242238
They saluted him and were saluted.	9063.744498226231
Father Conmee passed H.	4605.107040288618
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Neill ’ s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.	9690.51431603643
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable.	9723.736170360546
In Youkstetter ’ s, the porkbutcher ’ s, Father Conmee observed pig ’ s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.	10266.606628000349
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him.	13991.489194108311
It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.	12167.360391067876
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.	5193.358512399387
J.	306.21619418874246
of saint Francis Xavier ’ s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.	12337.091450030095
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C.	12230.237262133443
C.	957.8630399978279
of saint Agatha ’ s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.	12005.768135739396
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.	14141.370687923432
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.	12824.619360561379
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket.	15252.40317712035
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap.	10759.60682968568
Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.	7733.31279187088
It was a peaceful day.	2935.3468357801494
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down.	9125.921753323097
His wife, Father Conmee supposed.	8415.714515560447
A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses.	8299.911239476503
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.	12806.796955417694
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car.	8261.17235660428
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.	11024.925331710589
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight.	11349.979917194749
The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her.	6658.917072611768
She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you, my child, _ that they have been absolved, _pray for <URL> But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.	12646.685992305145
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.	11248.153435945387
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.	8464.549479036526
J.	306.21619418874246
and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night.	11525.327619952015
That book by the Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus, _ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea.	12199.707168697603
Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (<URL>.) been brought.	13437.75237952715
But they were God ’ s souls, created by God.	7106.800993247211
It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.	9817.880299703089
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.	12174.718475823838
The Malahide road was quiet.	7054.376609466871
It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.	7609.028831794672
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide.	7698.713928929603
Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.	13788.725411992025
Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.	10093.645538658348
Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.	13941.784251675801
Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.	12140.488341632525
A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged.	12567.431540323794
Who could know the truth?	9989.780302881529
Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, _ with her husband ’ s brother?	12598.027701440727
She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did.	9015.939791136847
Only God knew and she and he, her husband ’ s brother.	8435.655647333133
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man ’ s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.	9441.696773633803
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore.	12648.202764582149
He was humane and honoured there.	3665.318751745134
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.	10067.65470693118
It was a charming day.	2935.3595208340216
The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves.	12103.746688899926
The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind.	9307.411632796966
_Moutonner, _ the French said.	8165.692723681195
A just and homely word.	5727.389273384233
Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey.	10854.405097162442
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field.	10816.435824305046
He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys ’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening.	11314.988528851896
He was their rector: his reign was mild.	7710.166039914439
Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.	8180.765172896292
An ivory bookmark told him the page.	9983.112770922375
Nones.	19456.598729469286
He should have read that before lunch.	8550.086538517342
But lady Maxwell had come.	6548.891990413647
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.	10287.602254491403
_Deus in <URL> He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ <URL> A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand.	14835.104704651192
The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	10439.854268559167
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary.	11293.772408077273
_Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor <URL> * * * Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner.	14679.25524963474
He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings.	11622.746185373428
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway.	13069.357222300489
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.	10483.46243568889
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.	10910.446099550787
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.	11913.320023777407
Constable <NUM> C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.	9310.243371187324
— That ’ s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.	2307.0541110488475
— Ay, Corny Kelleher said.	1644.3449015471333
— It ’ s very close, the constable said.	2675.675899971296
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.	12998.326422427961
— What ’ s the best news?	1360.0949917121552
he asked.	1146.2406223222367
— I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.	7022.644216503333
Towards Larry O ’ Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably: — _For England_...	8171.966982045573
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled: — _home and <URL> J.	8910.065751975397
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy ’ s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.	8121.398771770079
A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her.	9209.803036084008
The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.	11255.293065384532
He halted and growled angrily: — _For England_...	3662.3331036127915
Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.	14297.886995044451
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply: — _home and <URL> The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.	13109.960100604663
The blind of the window was drawn aside.	6781.437500060514
A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps.	13043.106471258116
A woman ’ s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.	6512.190184164164
It fell on the path.	6116.764557433358
One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel ’ s cap, saying: — There, sir.	7147.950133479258
* * * Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.	8432.829812819862
— Did you put in the books?	5266.5197820286285
Boody asked.	4717.430190867956
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.	15302.47420045619
— They wouldn ’ t give anything on them, she said.	2613.6730105649535
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.	10780.287086567023
— Where did you try?	4996.40841549614
Boody asked.	4717.430190867956
— M ’ Guinness ’ s.	1927.736455052265
Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.	9757.70262665132
— Bad cess to her big face! she cried.	6517.413604160698
Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.	10558.843800560586
— What ’ s in the pot?	1882.264115761877
she asked.	6393.970707824759
— Shirts, Maggy said.	2389.836848569389
Boody cried angrily: — Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?	13686.01272901789
Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked: — And what ’ s in this?	9646.430605410002
A heavy fume gushed in answer.	6613.352268307196
— Peasoup, Maggy said.	2389.836848569389
Katey asked.	6046.998411286293
— Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.	3672.8649669591914
The lacquey rang his bell.	4864.063993200458
— Barang! Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily: — Give us it here.	7332.901995158423
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl.	15783.820749832032
Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs: — A good job we have that much.	13655.549715055675
Where ’ s Dilly?	4704.888945244785
— Gone to meet father, Maggy said.	4269.377784942553
Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added: — Our father who art not in heaven.	13794.247320585098
Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey ’ s bowl, exclaimed: — Boody! For shame! A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George ’ s quay.	14828.798643763717
* * * The blond girl in Thornton ’ s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre.	12115.864843174151
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.	13866.293318669317
— Put these in first, will you?	4136.430070625265
he said.	497.15978922676095
— Yes, sir, the blond girl said.	1622.6680791763401
And the fruit on top.	4727.932249873632
— That ’ ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.	3221.489743375458
She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.	12525.419712130753
Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.	13444.922488877864
H.	3260.787118728146
E.	1948.1085920489277
L.	2728.379725348002
Y. ’ S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.	13424.679811524828
He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain ’ s length.	10890.267674756433
— Can you send them by tram?	7063.709753046742
Now?	5223.485755744552
A darkbacked figure under Merchants ’ arch scanned books on the hawker ’ s cart.	10983.00924735789
— Certainly, sir.	1101.414202748754
Is it in the city?	5287.546495367634
— O, yes, Blazes Boylan said.	1740.2826972949674
Ten minutes.	9701.129177455667
The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.	8618.88408795401
— Will you write the address, sir?	4233.091540161876
Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.	8491.407066407197
— Send it at once, will you?	4307.933194372232
he said.	497.15978922676095
It ’ s for an invalid.	3517.9300667026946
— Yes, sir.	348.821558736703
I will, sir.	1114.2474478126703
Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers ’ pocket.	9313.385939710062
— What ’ s the damage?	1509.4210164497981
he asked.	1146.2406223222367
The blond girl ’ s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.	8247.020487584718
Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse.	10594.316480275407
A young pullet.	5317.803611327117
He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.	7640.751807578338
he asked gallantly.	6002.734863855497
The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.	10560.355407396884
— Yes, sir, she said.	544.3533222745837
Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.	16249.892975181298
Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.	11904.04583802303
— May I say a word to your telephone, missy?	8330.812977903603
he asked roguishly.	6002.734863855497
* * * _ — Ma! _ Almidano Artifoni said.	5804.8554059184125
He gazed over Stephen ’ s shoulder at Goldsmith ’ s knobby poll.	7784.308001687034
Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests.	13908.526823922153
Palefaces.	16997.075953601572
Men ’ s arms frankly round their stunted forms.	12925.804876497654
They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.	11509.105664630913
— _Anch ’ io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand ’ ero giovine come Lei.	11830.613935966507
Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.	17216.031693751804
È peccato.	18679.07077551165
Perchè la sua voce...	4797.477250678303
sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.	17451.623842446083
_ — Speriamo, _ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly.	8745.306817469303
_Ma, dia retta a me.	9843.614424654572
Ci rifletta_.	18679.07077551165
By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.	12658.709880778879
— _Ci rifletterò, _ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.	7332.971681416029
— _Ma, sul serio, eh? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	4833.349983115972
His heavy hand took Stephen ’ s firmly.	6688.884356944588
Human eyes.	7099.462477782906
They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.	11065.057278764847
_ — Eccolo, _ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste.	7900.235161557087
_Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi.	17570.648302713715
Addio, <URL> — _Arrivederla, maestro, _ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed.	12407.631984296208
_E <URL> — _Di che? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	8161.974334499866
_Scusi, eh?	7052.373937773298
In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.	12997.606256053708
* * * Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_ far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.	13431.7257660254
Too much mystery business in it.	4598.503113936053
Is he in love with that one, Marion?	8719.012495808282
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.	15640.040495994783
The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.	9033.597117481997
Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard: — <NUM> June <NUM>.	9386.463587957345
Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny ’ s corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone ’ s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H.	12698.569689486565

Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses.	12142.300224766397
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks.	16054.739094457042
She ’ s not nicelooking, is she?	3757.6479422049
The way she ’ s holding up her bit of a skirt.	7579.899468262511
Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight.	10674.587295976127
If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle ’ s.	7043.924806758229
They kick out grand.	7416.79755497303
Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.	10430.290757332363
Hope to goodness he won ’ t keep me here till seven.	10014.212493868159
— Hello.	1409.206880949738
Yes, sir.	577.8527243814603
No, sir.	767.9699379387081
Yes, sir.	577.8527243814603
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	3037.5484804883677
Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool.	10535.973738718312
All right, sir.	1948.433409571089
Then I can go after six if you ’ re not back.	6074.271904231089
A quarter after.	3894.3555843401564
Yes, sir.	577.8527243814603
Twentyseven and six.	9501.483173554341
I ’ ll tell him.	793.219954592164
Yes: one, seven, six.	7218.2896601891825
She scribbled three figures on an envelope.	8665.853344992143
— Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.	7004.394910695709
Mr Lenehan, yes.	3522.8958261601438
He said he ’ ll be in the Ormond at four.	4303.658790318477
No, sir.	767.9699379387081
Yes, sir.	577.8527243814603
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	3037.5484804883677
* * * Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.	11809.659297489041
— Who ’ s that?	974.6399119308163
Ned Lambert asked.	2802.6945636846804
Is that Crotty?	6509.5210252508805
— Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.	9904.450869390852
— Hello, Jack, is that yourself?	4220.803612107858
Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches.	10510.832555790697
Come on.	2128.6281357408134
Mind your steps there.	8362.2317041561
The vesta in the clergyman ’ s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall.	11472.463506293747
At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.	10160.076787109982
— How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.	7490.301199901981
— Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily.	1957.9091820538783
We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary ’ s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in <NUM>.	10604.184352727732
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.	7596.799808258796
The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews ’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road.	11275.11133495213
You were never here before, Jack, were you?	6915.130224072537
— No, Ned.	1411.5078705085275
— He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me.	7795.489849594682
— That ’ s right, Ned Lambert said.	1141.1501314215927
That ’ s quite right, sir.	1647.5745492234855
— If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...	6256.090771005366
— Certainly, Ned Lambert said.	1500.3397794755545
Bring the camera whenever you like.	10584.314676299029
I ’ ll get those bags cleared away from the windows.	4593.121430400954
You can take it from here or from here.	6850.469714109568
In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.	9914.578676256187
From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.	10853.0719200774
— I ’ m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said.	3262.290128172986
I won ’ t trespass on your valuable time...	3177.5280725183948
— You ’ re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said.	1895.3657020382113
Drop in whenever you like.	9833.937622674219
Next week, say.	7781.758320744152
Can you see?	4204.384048449913
— Yes, yes.	618.3926604647567
Good afternoon, Mr Lambert.	8482.796261885858
Very pleased to have met you.	8282.721425541202
— Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.	4587.621017363164
He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars.	11123.079364653755
With J.	2458.1373870608772
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary ’ s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O ’ Connor, Wexford.	10326.422993610191
He stood to read the card in his hand.	4327.747054509037
— The reverend Hugh C.	1954.602339979166
Present address: Saint Michael ’ s, Sallins.	12290.851564529032
Nice young chap he is.	5425.098888961205
He ’ s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me.	3936.2240168573217
He ’ s well up in history, faith.	3499.6265278312926
The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	7747.4742395008825
— I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.	4109.713202734957
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Molloy said.	777.0663592827124
Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.	5087.047879772911
— God! he cried.	2663.5522082935854
I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.	10621.742366821027
You know that one?	5038.7833353503775
_I ’ m bloody sorry I did it, _ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was <URL> He mightn ’ t like it, though.	10756.398169217684
What?	572.8670519115202
God, I ’ ll tell him anyhow.	3011.309464547998
That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor.	8037.215304209898
Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.	9589.674791690677
The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness.	10058.68776106414
He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried: — Woa, sonny! He turned to J.	8644.575821900497
O ’ Molloy and asked: — Well, Jack.	3842.3057079161586
What is it?	768.6383175649803
What ’ s the trouble?	2004.0273283750205
Wait awhile.	5066.401917412752
Hold hard.	8195.09019880923
With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.	12992.754479609517
— Chow! he said.	1326.5575368085354
Blast you! — The dust from those sacks, J.	8764.864947365077
J.	306.21619418874246
— No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a...	2620.982840351944
cold night before...	3794.4822525102722
blast your soul...	3436.7969066681535
night before last...	3794.4002933659904
and there was a hell of a lot of draught...	4076.525034122014
He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...	3713.6382211872883
— I was...	520.8345389220129
Glasnevin this morning...	3113.178215999096
poor little...	3176.6711472315274
what do you call him...	2979.118769300499
Chow!...	2577.976339968048
Mother of Moses! * * * Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.	12489.210290476733
— See?	1675.6614699441316
he said.	497.15978922676095
Say it ’ s turn six.	6005.008896435873
In here, see.	4327.038943446717
Turn Now On. He slid it into the left slot for them.	8732.852873423164
It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.	9415.750233774837
Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king ’ s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.	13781.3715503498
— See?	1675.6614699441316
See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.	13781.627483827511
The impact.	4122.464502427211
Leverage, see?	9501.483171816411
He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.	6785.188545838149
— Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	4980.133644112676
So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.	12164.488203249566
— See?	1675.6614699441316
Tom Rochford said.	2929.9227589203165
He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four.	11427.981010095371
Turn Now On. — I ’ ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him.	6297.935439079417
One good turn deserves another.	7943.933759280511
— Do, Tom Rochford said.	2409.703639253905
Tell him I ’ m Boylan with impatience.	6801.594952739174
— Goodnight, M ’ Coy said abruptly.	4419.387524783597
When you two begin...	2787.97309076531
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.	8114.800372552686
— But how does it work here, Tommy?	7311.602606639462
he asked.	1146.2406223222367
— Tooraloo, Lenehan said.	1750.7820321659026
See you later.	10014.394506297678
— He ’ s a hero, he said simply.	1873.6443925461986
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	917.6015015056364
The drain, you mean.	5079.607558932884
— Drain?	3451.237535283804
Lenehan said.	1273.2158824405733
It was down a manhole.	5811.851846611658
They passed Dan Lowry ’ s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.	10836.865502292721
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M ’ Coy how the whole thing was.	11610.037952690307
One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas.	10832.868724462358
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky ’ s vest and all, with the rope round him.	9950.932341510901
And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.	8893.959083614967
— The act of a hero, he said.	1649.3123863955138
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.	10757.184310974759
— This way, he said, walking to the right.	3137.778606062065
I want to pop into Lynam ’ s to see Sceptre ’ s starting price.	8085.337780363755
What ’ s the time by your gold watch and chain?	5072.924659153668
M ’ Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses ’ sombre office, then at O ’ Neill ’ s clock.	9281.63740677724
— After three, he said.	1142.1943674204533
Who ’ s riding her?	4537.653511078511
— O.	799.5807132445499
Madden, Lenehan said.	2889.3695097632435
While he waited in Temple bar M ’ Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter.	13798.30700927951
Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.	11429.23487863812
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.	10868.65446524241
— Even money, Lenehan said returning.	6015.196117614936
I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn ’ t an earthly.	11880.651130360044
Through here.	5214.634095541722
They went up the steps and under Merchants ’ arch.	9271.14655565244
— There he is, Lenehan said.	1319.4181673373873
— Wonder what he ’ s buying, M ’ Coy said, glancing behind.	5024.07738676474
— _Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, _ Lenehan said.	6222.967610104442
— He ’ s dead nuts on sales, M ’ Coy said.	2132.559693476974
I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob.	9680.165058908842
There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails.	11650.247663622047
Astronomy it was about.	11433.080313216264
Lenehan laughed.	6149.027528388068
— I ’ ll tell you a damn good one about comets ’ tails, he said.	2623.8074538729356
Come over in the sun.	4406.594443011813
They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.	11951.03372562887
Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.	9001.488781284597
— There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly.	5831.643797892347
The annual dinner, you know.	3762.435767079479
Boiled shirt affair.	15868.195079096857
The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music.	10385.807568095453
Bartell d ’ Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...	5813.512841398583
— I know, M ’ Coy broke in.	1928.2348469756746
My missus sang there once.	7271.000332191978
— Did she?	2092.4788450748856
Lenehan said.	1273.2158824405733
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number <NUM> Eccles street.	8129.236980850894
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.	10154.151483676591
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	1363.3375637487788
Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher.	17077.376134049795
Bloom and the wife were there.	5305.903970296866
Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice.	16595.118098462823
Fast and furious it was.	9488.751745662363
After liquids came solids.	10979.859907691622
Cold joints galore and mince pies...	5420.684916959756
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	917.6015015056364
The year the missus was there...	2774.4690186722974
Lenehan linked his arm warmly.	11310.09274046544
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	1363.3375637487788
We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o ’ clock the morning after the night before.	11514.619661464321
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter ’ s night on the Featherbed Mountain.	12591.661418639489
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other.	7494.935483970451
We started singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_.	13352.3246673097
She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt ’ s port under her bellyband.	10814.244233550326
Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me.	10963.216864146552
Hell ’ s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her.	11670.724097503848
Like that.	1751.4626034088155
He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning: — I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.	8344.904440855504
He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.	10081.530186497106
— The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.	4809.253041870732
She ’ s a gamey mare and no mistake.	4306.671309323063
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot.	12800.231170060648
But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way.	4916.168367997755
He knows them all, faith.	3854.9394371588114
_And what star is that, Poldy? _ says she.	11894.009613936909
By God, she had Bloom cornered.	7415.683362236721
_That one, is it? _ says Chris Callinan, _sure that ’ s only what you might call a <URL> By God, he wasn ’ t far wide of the mark.	10182.516722461585
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.	12657.285122446283
— I ’ m weak, he gasped.	2813.9785292522024
M ’ Coy ’ s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.	8781.51915766554
Lenehan walked on again.	5730.926725408021
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly.	7675.4319198953735
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M ’ Coy.	6330.859043161201
— He ’ s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously.	3547.5879379456246
He ’ s not one of your common or garden...	2369.9978762675255
you know...	2203.5129915353973
There ’ s a touch of the artist about old Bloom.	4224.278195500789
* * * Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk_, then of Aristotle ’ s <URL> Crooked botched print.	12876.670179007911
Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows.	16227.292005137237
Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world.	7546.779590945801
All butting with their skulls to get out of it.	4384.991756190508
Child born every minute somewhere.	12322.16135311186
Mrs Purefoy.	6130.709245127377
He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.	11916.234760634932
— That I had, he said, pushing it by.	3510.120184383068
The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.	6504.478875360033
— Them are two good ones, he said.	2587.9120651130747
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.	11360.420474053257
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.	10719.644336603593
On O ’ Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c.	10804.718261276408
Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles.	5010.8817943323165
_Fair Tyrants_ by James Lovebirch.	15786.38218974797
Know the kind that is.	6030.151922033333
Had it?	4219.084597639738
Yes.	804.865728120872
He opened it.	1813.2759156719105
Thought so.	6056.292279244565
A woman ’ s voice behind the dingy curtain.	5043.189591945824
Listen: the man.	6485.12320786586
Got her it once.	7561.656216035864
He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_.	8192.731253966256
More in her line.	9775.194546791383
Let us see.	3688.572984985833
He read where his finger opened.	7220.4153060508625
For him! For Raoul! _ Yes.	7185.626192781773
This.	4891.821109978673
Here.	1968.8314675885797
Try.	11379.205787978168
— _Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her <URL> Yes.	10412.911236250535
Take this.	6506.137990485558
The end.	2215.2061877395145
— You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.	8737.73753474719
The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint.	11605.14957409278
An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.	12819.568091749074
Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful <URL> Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh.	9546.426595119821
Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up.	13153.746466110239
His nostrils arched themselves for prey.	9174.419522323005
Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul! _).	10595.429810775508
Armpits ’ oniony sweat.	17932.61452774436
Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint! _).	10875.714653993798
Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions! Young! Young! An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king ’ s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor ’ s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.	13207.144238596053
Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains.	14802.497394460284
The shopman ’ s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing.	11470.444686127845
He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor.	7054.540295529644
He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.	11774.149312309555
Mr Bloom beheld it.	1982.2268481321453
Mastering his troubled breath, he said: — I ’ ll take this one.	4518.511220561195
The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.	8849.088156184825
— _Sweets of Sin, _ he said, tapping on it.	4903.433941879853
That ’ s a good one.	1112.6847783370686
Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within.	14635.463349090347
Four and nine.	7988.875644043671
Those lovely curtains.	8587.18370161378
Five shillings.	7193.350682144062
Cosy curtains.	13423.33993185836
Selling new at two guineas.	14084.625279058942
Any advance on five shillings?	12757.274533324444
Going for five shillings.	9102.79076330952
The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it: — Barang! Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.	11654.406328875291
J.	306.21619418874246

T.	2808.5869331601516
Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.	16102.489407844503
Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams ’ s row.	9491.973494161522
He halted near his daughter.	4777.050017256087
— It ’ s time for you, she said.	1571.279642300968
— Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.	3957.8299968537385
Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?	12656.959204952655
Melancholy God! Dilly shrugged her shoulders.	14594.968448914206
Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.	6902.93843681292
— Stand up straight, girl, he said.	2341.9801826310413
You ’ ll get curvature of the spine.	5656.911774827522
Do you know what you look like?	4442.452625308448
He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.	11776.633162034295
— Give it up, father, Dilly said.	3064.8446325305704
All the people are looking at you.	5083.381536407177
Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.	8607.820537480233
— Did you get any money?	4317.87930335661
Dilly asked.	5777.604737326292
— Where would I get money?	5320.609019782821
Mr Dedalus said.	435.62173536635805
There is no - one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.	8285.991544628014
— You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.	4162.56919716619
— How do you know that?	1750.0936394893567
Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.	6021.102728487546
Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James ’ s street.	7624.4292067161305
— I know you did, Dilly answered.	3280.314960498016
Were you in the Scotch house now?	7677.754240544062
Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy?	11484.735969574449
Here.	1968.8314675885797
— See if you can do anything with that, he said.	2841.274945051305
— I suppose you got five, Dilly said.	2909.7243909398303
Give me more than that.	5273.272582300532
— Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly.	4256.234510681225
You ’ re like the rest of them, are you?	3276.4386899240944
An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died.	11777.27808856802
But wait awhile.	4903.987190602928
You ’ ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me.	6885.766413124312
Low blackguardism! I ’ m going to get rid of you.	5376.801246724205
Wouldn ’ t care if I was stretched out stiff.	8953.729935873731
He ’ s dead.	1015.9339944233719
The man upstairs is dead.	3414.0291882778597
He left her and walked on.	4248.869715694424
Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.	12046.572903602026
— Well, what is it?	1200.8096028817029
he said, stopping.	3256.389441893661
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.	7524.32027377761
— Barang! — Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.	6633.185702153248
The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly: — Bang! Mr Dedalus stared at him.	9640.823964689125
— Watch him, he said.	1040.9163002415596
It ’ s instructive.	2522.1736372598652
— You got more than that, father, Dilly said.	3390.018672000269
— I ’ m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said.	1978.0673056035532
I ’ ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews.	5359.478748266861
Look, there ’ s all I have.	4605.966939885131
I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.	9909.397152693433
He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.	8091.598623139238
— Can ’ t you look for some money somewhere?	5604.208212827798
Dilly said.	2664.1091562325996
Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.	4919.632116001802
— I will, he said gravely.	1866.1762676562653
I looked all along the gutter in O ’ Connell street.	5606.571280126414
I ’ ll try this one now.	2465.600391845634
— You ’ re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.	4696.326188882186
— Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies.	4250.946323874862
Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something.	11035.084253490215
I ’ ll be home shortly.	1975.929149504892
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.	6081.368960450578
The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.	10055.473956353824
— I ’ m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.	2248.6464324672315
The lacquey banged loudly.	5097.220057209956
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently: — The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn ’ t do anything! O, sure they wouldn ’ t really! Is it little sister Monica! * * * From the sundial towards James ’ s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James ’ s street, past Shackleton ’ s offices.	10954.252048589888
Got round him all right.	5650.464525212891
How do you do, Mr Crimmins?	4452.944823747588
First rate, sir.	3513.362147497484
I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico.	8820.96352534749
How are things going?	5168.814583831562
Just keeping alive.	6866.648214347299
Lovely weather we ’ re having.	12819.976943333224
Yes, indeed.	2824.186918177881
Good for the country.	7400.773511870356
Those farmers are always grumbling.	12505.466865265842
I ’ ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins.	6122.56197596548
Yes, sir.	577.8527243814603
Terrible affair that _General Slocum_ explosion.	15669.322221546165
Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.	15764.23196548829
And heartrending scenes.	6326.0672817923205
Men trampling down women and children.	11906.785500853053
Most brutal thing.	8303.858069345977
What do they say was the cause?	7209.125907315676
Spontaneous combustion.	15707.401234162855
Most scandalous revelation.	12738.676159755245
Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst.	10885.18007336682
What I can ’ t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that...	5203.3630173176
Now, you ’ re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.	6810.588228988406
You know why?	3798.938966124278
Palm oil.	14855.255256694074
Is that a fact?	3384.706490271538
Without a doubt.	13211.516355352336
Well now, look at that.	5122.876047892925
And America they say is the land of the free.	6538.26965344409
I thought we were bad here.	4908.604279690401
I smiled at him.	2229.0834915945593
_America, _ I said quietly, just like that.	8689.359856138537
_What is it?	4701.481278203293
The sweepings of every country including our own.	7865.492998655268
Isn ’ t that true? _ That ’ s a fact.	4789.134637388007
Graft, my dear sir.	9309.401649022766
Well, of course, where there ’ s money going there ’ s always someone to pick it up.	5713.652474281488
Saw him looking at my frockcoat.	13840.896619409375
Dress does it.	4813.862709277094
Nothing like a dressy appearance.	11907.986819778023
Bowls them over.	10606.844285364768
— Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	1558.832862063518
How are things?	4040.4262496129136
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	3996.38765390134
Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser.	11780.475258785742
Stylish coat, beyond a doubt.	12984.24529334712
Scott of Dawson street.	10094.044161519347
Never built under three guineas.	10291.604526773725
Fits me down to the ground.	8109.493888574054
Some Kildare street club toff had it probably.	10151.824522652267
John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.	12362.262963662837
Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows.	14526.88019193587
Knight of the road.	8860.584192698445
Gentleman.	19456.598729469286
And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir.	6988.120494341628
The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.	7248.708075056173
North wall and sir John Rogerson ’ s quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.	13180.173829847494
Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image.	8327.74622388754
High colour, of course.	5919.18803363875
Grizzled moustache.	14193.45389360042
Returned Indian officer.	15498.762615744456
Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders.	14757.87237152229
Is that Ned Lambert ’ s brother over the way, Sam?	7916.920723893743
What?	572.8670519115202
Yes.	804.865728120872
He ’ s as like it as damn it.	2745.32273511821
No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there.	5967.947097897898
Damn like him.	5157.302042411796
Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.	13435.903615246034
Good drop of gin, that was.	6185.8936784695325
His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.	11830.762807078909
Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered.	14324.60647832854
Greasy black rope.	15498.762615744456
Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant ’ s wife drove by in her noddy.	13092.271588326823
Bad times those were.	11695.511728656846
Well, well.	2753.741138068173
Over and done with.	8925.885875382752
Great topers too.	6114.240648116408
Fourbottle men.	10785.671285083545
Let me see.	2154.974809961259
Is he buried in saint Michan ’ s?	8577.243629569384
Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin.	8616.932465538313
Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall.	11097.452338861895
Dignam is there now.	5602.014208404282
Went out in a puff.	13741.9540123103
Well, well.	2753.741138068173
Better turn down here.	5811.145730919931
Make a detour.	10063.771365826717
Outside the Dublin Distillers Company ’ s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel.	14077.93435055098
Damn dangerous thing.	8303.858069345977
Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens.	13136.209380064793
Runaway horse.	13656.980144780438
Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton ’ s office, led his wife over O ’ Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.	11703.882413704501
Mr Kernan approached Island street.	4436.763333844653
Times of the troubles.	16889.240598459586
When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement.	9486.31944976193
Gaming at Daly ’ s.	5571.630882075764
No cardsharping then.	4234.126921608734
One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger.	9816.660588978608
Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr.	15420.19046202235
Stables behind Moira house.	11240.863100003096
Damn good gin that was.	7342.8946940460455
Fine dashing young nobleman.	13602.859108471028
Good stock, of course.	4608.077730061271
That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away.	9919.295019195251
Course they were on the wrong side.	8518.498501076656
They rose in dark and evil days.	8249.495235045317
Fine poem that is: Ingram.	13401.24353910303
They were gentlemen.	4223.160136730469
Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly.	11463.045995411934
Masterly rendition.	18679.07077551165
_At the siege of Ross did my father <URL> A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles.	14176.995017832729
Frockcoats.	19456.598729469286
Cream sunshades.	15251.62811167228
Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.	8717.686841363586
His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair.	9489.402350366137
Damn it! What a pity! * * * Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary ’ s fingers prove a timedulled chain.	12640.115724606121
Dust webbed the window and the showtrays.	15091.643935757847
Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.	14929.523383558078
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.	15129.050491198883
Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness.	13685.649922058585
Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows.	11530.814184075405
Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.	13213.288493562797
She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic.	11156.96028946406
A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her.	8973.331655930364
A long and seafed silent rut.	7734.22901648735
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.	12942.84052930647
Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses ’ beard.	12468.838287565528
Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.	16688.390595743385
And you who wrest old images from the burial earth?	10116.101388221965
The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes.	8916.573102510616
A lore of drugs.	7210.794285683783
Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting.	14371.767490678647
Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife ’ s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.	13423.052640418122
The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on.	10196.0100809062
Beingless beings.	16878.573427268955
Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within.	13631.238014040067
Your heart you sing of.	8278.140441521435
I between them.	2307.9776147566263
Where?	1599.242359848175
Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.	10620.862434643775

But stun myself too in the blow.	8598.229391239262
Shatter me you who can.	14675.589824496315
Bawd and butcher were the words.	11752.333128028586
I say! Not yet awhile.	6495.748763149349
A look around.	5317.803611327117
Yes, quite true.	3791.3161895189937
You say right, sir.	2817.9875880385634
Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade.	12191.117648736466
In Clohissey ’ s window a faded <NUM> print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye.	9446.308553837402
Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering.	17218.156843690427
The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists.	11413.163283293723
And they are throbbing: heroes ’ hearts.	7490.803538434588
He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.	7020.2795392883745

A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides.	11023.978501903026

Stephen asked.	1428.5347086661152

— What did you buy that for?	4386.1658710024
he asked.	1146.2406223222367

Misery! Misery! * * * — Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	5461.531771174685
How are things?	4040.4262496129136
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	3996.38765390134
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter ’ s.	6445.796477990532
Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.	9203.892049121234
— What ’ s the best news?	1360.0949917121552
Mr Dedalus said.	435.62173536635805
— Why then not much, Father Cowley said.	3160.748378861246
I ’ m barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.	8317.159304021536
— Jolly, Mr Dedalus said.	1250.0881416481507
Who is it?	1795.7220917953205
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.	9509.07005684733
— With a broken back, is it?	3630.425927590476
Mr Dedalus asked.	1246.069041670398
— The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered.	3596.269615458052
Reuben of that ilk.	14940.307152601958
He ’ s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off.	5557.975624981979
All I want is a little time.	6217.567622113565
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.	8324.814278436937
— I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	1872.1355293590123
Poor old bockedy Ben! He ’ s always doing a good turn for someone.	9127.03049577713
Hold hard! He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.	12023.10568427218
— There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.	3150.5600878569535
Ben Dollard ’ s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.	11737.459341596617
He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.	10343.814758752824
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted: — Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.	10120.654700207207
— Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.	2906.9474160530863
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard ’ s figure.	9051.64337236389
Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly: — That ’ s a pretty garment, isn ’ t it, for a summer ’ s day?	7780.714500293579
— Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.	10021.027091416203
He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying: — They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.	10719.800950625371
— Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.	5374.384713376782
Thanks be to God he ’ s not paid yet.	5905.69812701547
— And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin?	6461.798113774975
Father Cowley asked.	4187.315689984206
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.	9258.970169923952
Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter ’ s mouth, gave forth a deep note.	12356.306645267121
— Aw! he said.	1326.5518039629503
— That ’ s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.	2912.2509554526564
— What about that?	1413.8605211026306
Ben Dollard said.	1753.4840050912658
Not too dusty?	7963.023390395647
What?	572.8670519115202
He turned to both.	2801.4976246812334
— That ’ ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.	3471.155290239571
The reverend Hugh C.	2446.171643368472
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.	9243.274349374042
— Come along with me to the subsheriff ’ s office, he said.	2981.0556590221163
I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.	8347.08391933299
He ’ s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun.	3631.2199174934212
He ’ s well worth seeing, mind you.	2968.9646629829467
Come along.	5645.995119005315
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don ’ t...	5501.382065792446
Wait awhile...	1640.0284647422943
We ’ re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.	5773.3126143769805
— For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.	6664.650973688135
Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.	14302.253461505761
— What few days?	3257.7827410123296
he boomed.	8579.278802260933
Hasn ’ t your landlord distrained for rent?	14960.583935076576
— He has, Father Cowley said.	1715.599568885001
— Then our friend ’ s writ is not worth the paper it ’ s printed on, Ben Dollard said.	6152.266248156345
The landlord has the prior claim.	6740.170746872421
I gave him all the particulars.	5120.435703649772
<NUM> Windsor avenue.	9395.548860867675
Love is the name?	7553.793323915648
— That ’ s right, Father Cowley said.	1204.2910719156337
The reverend Mr Love.	5097.1686669498795
He ’ s a minister in the country somewhere.	2816.969468389146
But are you sure of that?	5995.3446766453835
— You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.	8403.948749569094
He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.	10476.126721416766
— Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.	6091.5520022138135
* * * — The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.	6136.253115475899
The policeman touched his forehead.	5939.969278326671
— God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.	4627.813120143835
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.	10354.453672511108
Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy ’ s head by Miss Douce ’ s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.	8661.297484908984
— Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.	2801.543449421848
I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.	6561.337624963888
— You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.	6250.499382802337
— Boyd?	3451.237535283804
Martin Cunningham said shortly.	3982.082476854112
Touch me not.	7322.974904353759
John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.	11573.124831864156
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.	11367.431329177956
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.	7291.062988200846
— Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_ office.	7487.868865837902
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.	6862.5021178537
— Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.	4106.279824615379
And put down the five shillings too.	6246.451551901333
— Without a second word either, Mr Power said.	3604.6833328306766
— Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.	5118.629722497402
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.	5863.637426771224
— I ’ ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.	6239.366012526093
They went down Parliament street.	4922.472131009305
— There ’ s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh ’ s.	3812.2845569702026
— Righto, Martin Cunningham said.	1380.983828593956
Here goes.	5378.16718859649
Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney ’ s brother - in - law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.	11438.12861548225
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson ’ s watches.	13546.278033249428
— The assistant town clerk ’ s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.	8230.522186604268
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh ’ s winerooms.	9325.823881224938
The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.	9603.65269239468
Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.	11499.015395917773
— And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.	6004.3758706036215
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.	9498.876928046224
— Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.	4939.853826821044
Long John Fanning made no way for them.	6340.273776073704
He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.	10552.563629930937
— Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?	7698.143293783577
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.	8528.499859527712
Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language.	14645.367309757712
Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber.	10690.800639673342
And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him.	10851.011135249484
Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.	14605.96743816524
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.	8277.835877644866
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.	10383.695087870055
— What Dignam was that?	2364.023204847279
long John Fanning asked.	7994.258218453461
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.	15340.524074246101
— O, my corns! he said plaintively.	3881.4531498839674
Come upstairs for goodness ’ sake till I sit down somewhere.	11052.620047519778
Uff! Ooo! Mind! Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning ’ s flank and passed in and up the stairs.	14911.382491032484
I don ’ t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.	4810.5842475519485
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.	7391.988925112893
— Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.	8072.492936732983
— Rather lowsized.	4720.919220798137
Dignam of Menton ’ s office that was, Martin Cunningham said.	4254.167511666926
Long John Fanning could not remember him.	6685.935304992875
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.	9396.244408655195
— What ’ s that?	636.9127384647712
Martin Cunningham said.	785.6524662118408
All turned where they stood.	8800.746519321796
John Wyse Nolan came down again.	5492.725398807306
From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.	12175.963692190642
Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.	14937.157699852478
In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.	11893.480492333993
— What was it?	1156.1580220201085
Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.	6598.140452576423
— The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.	6704.5640054356845
* * * As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines: — Parnell ’ s brother.	10646.058379469672
There in the corner.	4324.113150264697
They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.	11842.945544450085
— Is that he?	1929.1484949725989
Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.	10215.598964709015
— Yes, Mulligan said.	772.4327285535604
That ’ s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.	7138.283341195066
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.	13028.180119735704
An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.	12763.851750668962
— I ’ ll take a _mélange, _ Haines said to the waitress.	4089.01786001324
— Two _mélanges, _ Buck Mulligan said.	2667.3258788962603
And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.	9822.65763391615
When she had gone he said, laughing: — We call it <URL>. because they have damn bad cakes.	10915.990369722222
O, but you missed Dedalus on <URL> Haines opened his newbought book.	8603.302615493025
— I ’ m sorry, he said.	664.6263114835203
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.	15041.305161617907
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of <NUM> Nelson street: — _England expects_...	7150.174677628847
Buck Mulligan ’ s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.	7447.052158135323
— You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.	5004.782601824543
Wandering Ængus I call him.	7942.296952916133
— I am sure he has an _idée fixe, _ Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger.	8544.22735006386
Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be.	7502.2084111815575
Such persons always have.	8662.940636821691
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.	6539.715219534995
— They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.	5449.177401601665
He will never capture the Attic note.	7234.213837091783
That is his tragedy.	5797.271035508367
He can never be a poet.	5819.695224871663
The joy of creation...	2142.4412134938284
— Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.	6220.479326752176
I see.	803.3839632815113
I tackled him this morning on belief.	8379.637297402456
There was something on his mind, I saw.	5975.343294761462
It ’ s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.	5837.139043951289
Buck Mulligan ’ s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.	6491.635784133583
He helped her to unload her tray.	8281.524872066931
— He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups.	8282.111364552857
The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution.	10470.631422205664
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.	13322.04498227774
Does he write anything for your movement?	14516.110134890572
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.	10433.933334151261
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith.	11707.592493955417
He bit off a soft piece hungrily.	8944.421550583289
— Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.	3848.7939498673877
He is going to write something in ten years.	4956.208370285144
— Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.	7824.830742216211
Still, I shouldn ’ t wonder if he did after all.	6998.971320377715
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.	9637.43260746747
— This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.	6474.3371843624145
I don ’ t want to be imposed on.	2037.786887001858
Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson ’ s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	14707.111307995725
* * * Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell ’ s yard.	9856.317958177064
Behind him Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith ’ s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square.	10967.604828233498
Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.	12973.571795414264
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner ’ s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.	11741.369045607875
At the corner of Wilde ’ s house he halted, frowned at Elijah ’ s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke ’ s lawn.	10613.14343483224
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.	5334.848733797172
With ratsteeth bared he muttered: — _Coactus <URL> He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.	12796.54880476975
As he strode past Mr Bloom ’ s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body.	11908.231089057304
The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.	8417.792122172628
— God ’ s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You ’ re blinder nor I am, you bitch ’ s bastard! * * * Opposite Ruggy O ’ Donohoe ’ s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.	8996.708365987892
It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney ’ s.	10901.233815175317
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.	10918.925318148635
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him.	9801.602894660215
From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently.	9882.92705885723
Gob, that ’ d be a good pucking match to see.	5681.227166976427
Myler Keogh, that ’ s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.	8867.654597407698
Two bar entrance, soldiers half price.	10378.505753825582
I could easy do a bunk on ma.	7689.11831124682
Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned.	11753.080867225688
That ’ s me in mourning.	3312.9886827725113
When is it?	2748.392261462041
May the twentysecond.	13493.02791219676
Sure, the blooming thing is all over.	10422.185197760762
He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up.	7423.74106108993
Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers.	13401.96136588145
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.	9905.086665981777
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.	10598.754782190288
The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons.	8653.86563594343
One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man.	9766.408614115155
But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.	9022.370445589371
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff ’ s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.	11199.968206941061
No Sandymount tram.	6023.8073271580215
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand.	11797.542532888823
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.	7950.295648299275
The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it.	8850.079550040438
He met schoolboys with satchels.	7082.073948416487
I ’ m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday.	5209.330374333382
He met other schoolboys.	5747.391691739402
Do they notice I ’ m in mourning?	6814.436538304416
Uncle Barney said he ’ d get it into the paper tonight.	10252.56720614339
Then they ’ ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa ’ s name.	7559.719386478349
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye.	9062.706234821813
The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.	10935.001361742678
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend.	14433.120034720236
A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking.	9102.660791831948
The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney ’ s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.	11747.405508989143
Never see him again.	4654.868748617232
Death, that is.	4315.170278242129
Pa is dead.	8028.47441924546
My father is dead.	4985.045536574179
He told me to be a good son to ma.	6557.061093464152
I couldn ’ t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better.	8335.58537984687
Poor pa.	7737.43763541091
That was Mr Dignam, my father.	5701.495472166932
I hope he ’ s in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.	7260.152793507121

The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays.	12266.877326504762
The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis.	9426.588608422013
At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar.	12202.275959912142

White ’ s, the pawnbroker ’ s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus.	12566.752167306882
In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise.	9209.652504581776
Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King ’ s windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty.	15166.545045338704

From Cahill ’ s corner the reverend Hugh C.	7424.948324461018

A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons.	11246.466100481637
Passing by Roger Greene ’ s office and Dollard ’ s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby ’ s cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn ’ t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring ’ s big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant.	12233.006217652055
Beyond Lundy Foot ’ s from the shaded door of Kavanagh ’ s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland.	12168.150263821843
The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G.	7231.145931311287

Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade.	14886.477972344293
Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her.	9762.692657436584
A charming _soubrette, _ great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H.	11367.207080981783

Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently.	12789.671966162452
In Fownes ’ s street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal ’ s first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare.	13299.032366203644
John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it.	11450.614429242672
Where the foreleg of King Billy ’ s horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders.	13353.812224290801
She shouted in his ear the tidings.	9491.57161784002
Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage.	15586.849070951195
The honourable Gerald Ward A.	3543.849888540552
C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply.	8324.928962088326
At Ponsonby ’ s corner a jaded white flagon H.	9360.577190891881

One rapped, one tapped, with a carra, with a cock.	8577.892011639347
Pray for him! Pray, good people! His gouty fingers nakkering.	13105.597969988634

Done.	9354.322974987937
Begin! Bronze by gold, miss Douce ’ s head by miss Kennedy ’ s head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.	9952.476631061696
— Is that her?	2285.7047275177597
asked miss Kennedy.	12064.947960991143
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de <URL> — Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.	10460.98253107915
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly: — Look at the fellow in the tall silk.	10137.437638539472
— Who?	651.1040733368873
Where?	1599.242359848175
gold asked more eagerly.	14932.562861526583
— In the second carriage, miss Douce ’ s wet lips said, laughing in the sun.	5829.694432274578
He ’ s looking.	1583.9883268061212
She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.	11873.47830920385
Her wet lips tittered: — He ’ s killed looking back.	6392.22478321527
She laughed: — O wept! Aren ’ t men frightful idiots?	10573.200350142488
With sadness.	7431.836760265275
Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear.	11776.671774173732
Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.	13093.629782012446
Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.	14272.059446267422
— It ’ s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.	3847.8608605675245
A man.	1375.511640634291
Bloowho went by by Moulang ’ s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine ’ s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll ’ s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.	15400.664260982572
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came.	8420.067329178564
And — There ’ s your teas, he said.	1899.425362040384
Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.	13297.982641311459
— What is it?	570.4162250476427
loud boots unmannerly asked.	9849.558645858377
— Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.	8789.88619008934
— Your _beau, _ is it?	3667.632205051532
A haughty bronze replied: — I ’ ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.	9409.08281108189
Bloom.	1055.12144237401
On her flower frowning miss Douce said: — Most aggravating that young brat is.	8806.407486892538
If he doesn ’ t conduct himself I ’ ll wring his ear for him a yard long.	7615.814884455193
Ladylike in exquisite contrast.	17932.61452774436
— Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.	6659.713398864724
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea.	9920.522162595642
They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw.	12127.515242720521
They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.	12358.111860093399
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.	10123.17745939308
— Am I awfully sunburnt?	6014.696508672799
Miss bronze unbloused her neck.	9531.461946823494
It gets brown after.	5635.994561157508
Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?	11353.097426679442
— And leave it to my hands, she said.	2685.40639247367
— Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.	8297.35051472822
Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce — Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated.	16078.20125306322
I asked that old fogey in Boyd ’ s for something for my skin.	9368.534543077783
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed: — O, don ’ t remind me of him for mercy ’ sake! — But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.	8703.64256875229
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.	14222.525614198765
— No, don ’ t, she cried.	1815.5118564600991
— I won ’ t listen, she cried.	2583.5349097520157
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey ’ s tone: — For your what?	9826.049236609464
says he.	1320.9708158927192
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again: — Don ’ t let me think of him or I ’ ll expire.	9723.707204074934
The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.	10192.882581924938
She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.	11907.25597050179
— Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings.	9185.507904869195
Hufa! Hufa! Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy ’ s throat.	15071.107685006144
Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.	12874.688588396226
— O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried.	4315.538088628592
Will you ever forget his goggle eye?	10636.95140282393
Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting: — And your other eye! Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner ’ s name.	10609.174990441026
Why do I always think Figather?	9037.954954560819
Gathering figs, I think.	7142.213968278372
And Prosper Loré ’ s huguenot name.	7290.5055439253465
By Bassi ’ s blessed virgins Bloom ’ s dark eyes went by.	9272.45379367489
Bluerobed, white under, come to me.	8633.391557827343
God they believe she is: or goddess.	13116.139031206916
Those today.	5245.695972728298
I could not see.	2322.0671074872953
That fellow spoke.	4943.024254406907
A student.	3367.952283471285
After with Dedalus ’ son.	7575.064776442707
He might be Mulligan.	4446.78647376666
All comely virgins.	6540.879895684971
That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.	10198.633642017961
By went his eyes.	4419.252410965041
The sweets of sin.	3182.806739352723
Sweet are the sweets.	11108.591276292938
Of sin.	6029.269333460617
In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye.	9378.513878742055
They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.	12552.705927925577
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.	9068.934434704297
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled.	12826.558558383967
Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying: — O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.	12530.223999558988
With his bit of beard! Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.	13924.935451988695
— Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.	9365.757887575184
Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter.	16263.131059706997
And then laughed more.	3398.8928026814365
Greasy I knows.	13993.783774949317
Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge.	16596.26449025406
All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.	9881.61274499665
Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.	14907.036377531409
— O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose.	7203.338762482496
I wished I hadn ’ t laughed so much.	5987.248073519339
I feel all wet.	4426.248652691537
— O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested.	4453.134230934156
You horrid thing! And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.	12397.087514745492
By Cantwell ’ s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi ’ s virgins, bright of their oils.	14021.857568458163
Nannetti ’ s father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I.	11515.52260511808
Religion pays.	16878.573427268955
Must see him for that par.	9014.996128385386
Eat first.	6518.448547757277
I want.	1805.190801910101
Not yet.	3192.064778040496
At four, she said.	1935.9596638252028
Time ever passing.	9233.57104634207
Clockhands turning.	14193.45389360042
On. Where eat?	7325.883836320525
The Clarence, Dolphin.	6549.079175127757
On. For Raoul.	7106.65680852709
Eat.	11785.827218061331
If I net five guineas with those ads.	8657.16804667391
The violet silk petticoats.	6121.223918802971
Not yet.	3192.064778040496
The sweets of sin.	3182.806739352723
Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.	17357.615104986966
Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus.	13101.405001223982
Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails.	12658.903658041716
He strolled.	3301.1096734088446
— O, welcome back, miss Douce.	3601.778738782191
He held her hand.	2282.595325026982
Enjoyed her holidays?	18227.54902377354
— Tiptop.	2817.966270688388
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.	9511.878456940678
— Gorgeous, she said.	1388.6871454901595
Lying out on the strand all day.	9281.09109551492
Bronze whiteness.	11589.25711997126
— That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently.	7113.386551757925
Tempting poor simple males.	14932.412306617918
Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.	8372.228157454936
— O go away! she said.	2044.135610315765
You ’ re very simple, I don ’ t think.	2790.870606547742
He was.	960.2710079167013
— Well now I am, he mused.	5374.840608533305
I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.	9423.450683958441
— You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer.	4559.703511586721
And what did the doctor order today?	7595.187145538711
— Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself.	5946.4428742549
I think I ’ ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.	7412.9372021292365
Jingle.	7424.980193238086
— With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.	6524.623109118186
With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s she turned herself.	11134.915283494127
With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg.	13000.10457936297
Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe.	14798.986453437734
Alacrity she served.	13993.699109352883
He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.	9513.08409477801
— By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains.	7550.989870832536
Must be a great tonic in the air down there.	5272.521375129708
But a long threatening comes at last, they say.	6027.1402555710865
Yes.	804.865728120872
Yes.	804.865728120872
Yes.	804.865728120872
He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid ’ s, into the bowl.	9178.81141957476
Chips.	15443.024084639697
Shreds.	19456.598729469286
Musing.	19456.598729469286
Mute.	19456.598729469286
None nought said nothing.	10578.266580214256
Yes.	804.865728120872
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling: — _O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas! _ — Was Mr Lidwell in today?	14091.035196478972
In came Lenehan.	4652.335347177004
Round him peered Lenehan.	9648.38117398161
Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge.	3945.284223282356
Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex.	4844.927829492986
To Martha I must write.	9046.361228027814
Buy paper.	8253.633535727255
Daly ’ s.	3606.5100769465694
Girl there civil.	13814.400447318581
Bloom.	1055.12144237401
Old Bloom.	3166.4226503021723
Blue bloom is on the rye.	10386.890291429618
— He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.	3127.179575584064
Lenehan came forward.	7638.252668198545
— Was Mr Boylan looking for me?	4772.767000274891
He asked.	1343.7537494746105
She answered: — Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?	11325.95791561151
She asked.	1927.3743637622124
Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page: — No. He was not.	13493.989566992082
Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.	11876.849678522747
— Peep! Who ’ s in the corner?	4031.3302892304127
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures.	11894.610361831581
To mind her stops.	8907.602817757848
To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.	12682.057156429963
Jingle jaunty jingle.	11746.576207236041
Girlgold she read and did not glance.	15247.85660206346
Take no notice.	10103.175613491383
She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly: — Ah fox met ah stork.	12676.016417082581
Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?	16588.900079902556
He droned in vain.	5031.316520709494
Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.	8992.876451835418
He sighed aside: — Ah me! O my! He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.	11166.894681349913
— Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.	7045.21843402937
— Who may he be?	3095.6681517366073
Mr Dedalus asked.	1246.069041670398
Lenehan opened most genial arms.	10020.353521394725
Who?	2501.556219488948
— Who may he be?	3095.6681517366073
he asked.	1146.2406223222367
Can you ask?	7340.9939551517955
Dry.	19456.598729469286
Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.	8185.098843572613
— I see, he said.	521.1148271946554
I didn ’ t recognise him for the moment.	3129.7593812638024
I hear he is keeping very select company.	7498.71809234312
Have you seen him lately?	7560.997338016562
He had.	1542.4235127586444
— I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.	6850.16418688754
He smiled at bronze ’ s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes: — The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips.	9837.190837171102
The ponderous pundit, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin ’ s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O ’ Madden Burke.	10868.360649987919
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and — That must have been highly diverting, said he.	9863.492869809552
I see.	803.3839632815113
He see.	1813.3533047848914
He drank.	2468.267152336429
With faraway mourning mountain eye.	7218.5701253683355
Set down his glass.	12119.686169343284
— I see you have moved the piano.	3889.8907456700304
— The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.	9746.90301301602
— Is that a fact?	1878.4490592524717
— Didn ’ t he, miss Kennedy?	5414.528007611232
The real classical, you know.	3762.435767079479
Not twenty I ’ m sure he was.	4173.396667737037
— Is that a fact?	1878.4490592524717
Mr Dedalus said.	435.62173536635805
He drank and strayed away.	4181.826754665477
— So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.	6873.617003550022
God ’ s curse on bitch ’ s bastard.	6834.946438792845
Tink to her pity cried a diner ’ s bell.	14776.782409513666
To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond.	10031.551014556384
Lager for diner.	16807.970545269076
Lager without alacrity she served.	13849.438419394137
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.	10977.03420416792
Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires.	15544.828979881324
He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.	13064.914238994379
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s wise Bloom in Daly ’ s Henry Flower bought.	10576.661084212275
Are you not happy in your home?	5933.492142282129
Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo.	16060.194779820216
Means something, language of flow.	14895.504785675628
Was it a daisy?	9163.458356528425
Innocence that is.	5348.442408625856
Respectable girl meet after mass.	14298.038131759304
Thanks awfully muchly.	12352.082759196523
Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.	14725.44315055358
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all.	9732.91217809891
Hair streaming: lovelorn.	15393.126810427384
For some man.	4619.632285929395
For Raoul.	5647.18831421866
He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car.	10843.358568282925
It is.	949.4594240553477
Again.	9354.322974987937
Coincidence.	9031.408469903961
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.	15584.332170890684
Follow.	16997.075953601572
Risk it.	5751.538303898366
Go quick.	7736.677621674715
At four.	3564.1116490301356
Near now.	4366.346166051878
Out.	5690.29118711202
— Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.	4641.069590812906
— Aha...	1030.4575094671836
I was forgetting...	1112.0538934218355
Excuse...	1777.8209685960132
— And four.	1720.2776593233293
At four she.	4331.145220617132
Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled.	14540.780123191715
Bloo smi qui go.	10775.973898824093
Ternoon.	19456.598729469286
Think you ’ re the only pebble on the beach?	9983.584625672167
For men.	4291.292072500103
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.	10010.151119233176
From the saloon a call came, long in dying.	10315.915220825205
That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck.	10240.28300417545
A call again.	3160.970359477476
That he now poised that it now throbbed.	9838.803599306735
You hear?	4523.407621528051
It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs.	12391.017197214129
Longer in dying call.	14553.878435373847
Pat paid for diner ’ s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss Douce.	15242.50374998352
— _The bright stars fade_...	2484.2702810850456
A voiceless song sang from within, singing: —...	4902.962415085085
_the morn is <URL> A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands.	14597.042564488587
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love ’ s leavetaking, life ’ s, love ’ s morn.	13663.690488272563
— _The dewdrops pearl_...	1960.278953031611
Lenehan ’ s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.	12168.301474543703
— But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.	3558.3527037685376
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.	10824.329777695317
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.	10371.060819511013
— Did she fall or was she pushed?	7034.780673111508
he asked her.	2262.0627397372305
She answered, slighting: — Ask no questions and you ’ ll hear no lies.	9920.540861704898
Like lady, ladylike.	10489.91037389947
Blazes Boylan ’ s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.	9406.45540090153
Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar.	7136.132345374044
Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him: — See the conquering hero comes.	13077.160804793053
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero.	12974.803710800941
See me he might.	9511.963086816546
The seat he sat on: warm.	7544.753935690103
Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding ’ s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.	15337.58273558067
— _And I from thee_...	2484.2285319551684
— I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.	5291.684287467109
He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw.	10517.743728547031
She smiled on him.	2778.4885203579183
But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.	12211.97051347083
Smart Boylan bespoke potions.	15976.304393411037
— What ’ s your cry?	1840.370365243343
Glass of bitter?	12903.856799372385
Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me.	8303.265285949103
Not yet.	3192.064778040496
At four she.	4331.145220617132
Who said four?	8167.02560255675
Cowley ’ s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff ’ s office.	8961.59643298547
Avoid.	19456.598729469286
Goulding a chance.	10605.754079406883
What is he doing in the Ormond?	5221.781982951815
Car waiting.	13423.33993185836
Wait.	1316.9653973396455
Hello.	4086.330067868833
Where off to?	6362.738142855748
Something to eat?	7476.120287100352
I too was just.	5223.432953115583
In here.	2340.6749869693385
What, Ormond?	4783.435801647642
Best value in Dublin.	5216.046255562322
Is that so?	3406.424713790107
Diningroom.	19456.598729469286
Sit tight there.	6290.772378625814
See, not be seen.	9482.630939980145
I think I ’ ll join you.	2519.096067038382
Come on.	2128.6281357408134
Richie led on.	6791.992812278894
Bloom followed bag.	7517.836418277717
Dinner fit for a prince.	12959.956544176184
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.	12531.357250750674
— O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch.	6940.781407873668
— Why don ’ t you grow?	2699.6141283615293
asked Blazes Boylan.	8176.279853463731
That is to say she.	4025.217438057706
Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.	17724.949940336057
He pitched a broad coin down.	5792.401786816825
Coin rang.	12452.996386040257
— Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...	3073.997163046913
— Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.	8659.85945256755
— Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.	3126.5339390138743
— I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking.	6921.6589700976065
Not on my own, you know.	5007.912198353555
Fancy of a friend of mine.	9350.013527644118
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce ’ s lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.	13722.480141598759
Idolores.	16997.075953601605
The eastern seas.	5018.299810285339
Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray.	13496.257368345106
Clock clacked.	9339.959189702
Miss Douce took Boylan ’ s coin, struck boldly the cashregister.	10740.00324585629
It clanged.	5777.244854897311
Clock clacked.	9339.959189702
Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change.	15576.138916636339
Look to the west.	8378.791479508613
A clack.	4762.787687825449
For me.	2170.6764461070047
— What time is that?	1657.7627283499844
asked Blazes Boylan.	8176.279853463731
Four?	11785.827218061331
O ’ clock.	2321.275546403669
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan ’ s elbowsleeve.	12192.330077128168
— Let ’ s hear the time, he said.	2368.209951441651
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.	9147.346020745113
Be near.	7750.906551666755
At four.	3564.1116490301356
Has he forgotten?	9654.520039335654
Perhaps a trick.	9483.201053074614
Not come: whet appetite.	10395.469249408516
I couldn ’ t do.	1906.6749416930602
Wait, wait.	5382.083724180061
Pat, waiter, waited.	8383.74607752276
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure ’ s skyblue bow and eyes.	13103.167102792415
— Go on, pressed Lenehan.	4070.956472753023
There ’ s no - one.	1557.349694809719
He never heard.	3526.514539457206
—...	369.623385050028
_to Flora ’ s lips did <URL> High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.	14979.926965995935
Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes Boylan ’ s flower and eyes.	12045.224720550748
— Please, please.	3273.840022414758
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.	8943.670073404995
— _I could not leave thee_...	2883.4704545660943
— Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.	6638.202573007739
— No, now, urged Lenehan.	3437.4172767399855
_Sonnez la cloche! _ O do! There ’ s no - one.	6815.324809113375
She looked.	3166.553506437855
Quick.	7721.979191697367
Miss Kenn out of earshot.	12175.005511083116
Sudden bent.	15707.401234162855
Two kindling faces watched her bend.	11047.449513904503
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.	15084.280353386706
— Go on! Do! _Sonnez! _ Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee.	10796.002401901971
Delayed.	19456.598729469286
Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.	13446.781470111202
_ — Sonnez! _ Smack.	6409.779049478281
She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman ’ s warmhosed thigh.	11022.291186872522
— _La cloche! _ cried gleeful Lenehan.	6474.152751682205
Trained by owner.	12738.290905111193
No sawdust there.	3608.083716365423
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren ’ t men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.	11916.303953436473
— You ’ re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.	4323.303092722435
Boylan, eyed, eyed.	16728.29362172405
Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops.	16901.59767489911
His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.	14294.886200202885
Yes, bronze from anearby.	5333.220221508899
—...	369.623385050028
_Sweetheart, goodbye! _ — I ’ m off, said Boylan with impatience.	7911.104061609882
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.	9082.580987030948
— Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly.	8015.255574843762
I wanted to tell you.	1947.522507336847
Tom Rochford...	1962.3456172668311
— Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.	5942.893966561086
Lenehan gulped to go.	6454.979258495113
— Got the horn or what?	5132.677763425825
he said.	497.15978922676095
Wait.	1316.9653973396455
I ’ m coming.	1166.5157573085062
— How do you do, Mr Dollard?	3407.284907779199
— Eh?	1732.609485688752
How do?	2466.835209522965
How do?	2466.835209522965
Ben Dollard ’ s vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley ’ s woe.	10733.226745271746
He won ’ t give you any trouble, Bob.	5904.02591030672
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow.	13958.029890514415
We ’ ll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot ’ s ear this time.	8010.715885075462
Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.	15891.137332020153
— Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily.	8112.4730788951265
Come on, Simon.	3423.7355839756356
Give us a ditty.	7055.822670384817
We heard the piano.	6660.030597188184
Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders.	10832.861304028316
Power for Richie.	14632.45380817492
And Bloom?	2375.7485725236875
Let me see.	2154.974809961259
Not make him walk twice.	8386.279037073286
His corns.	6055.98139396054
Four now.	4876.105880834328
How warm this black is.	6091.615309048061
Course nerves a bit.	7661.164838254438
Refracts (is it?) heat.	10566.054029188797
Let me see.	2154.974809961259
Cider.	16997.075953601572
Yes, bottle of cider.	5333.1510881970935
— What ’ s that?	636.9127384647712
Mr Dedalus said.	435.62173536635805
— Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called.	4237.85747655307
Begone dull care.	13814.400447318581
Come, Bob.	5546.775849773731
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon.	12230.423668072215
He plumped him Dollard on the stool.	7932.32499900589
Plumped, stopped abrupt.	17932.795353842193
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning.	10703.84018968656
Bothered, he wanted Power and cider.	14135.953187532736
Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.	9914.467253327257
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.	13303.736415385645
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound.	9504.248386277035
He ’ s off.	1114.4821479429677
Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.	14267.49133000143
Jingling.	14336.178182593083
He ’ s gone.	843.9291399420024
Jingle.	7424.980193238086
Hear.	14336.178182593083
— Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.	2356.594863236087
God be with old times.	8067.649515138265
Miss Douce ’ s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight.	11321.965651070654
Gone.	4782.2098951201715
Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord.	16251.510490910789
She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, _eau de <URL> — Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them.	13276.305566940504
There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.	8562.098034858553
There was.	1924.2329889391542
— A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.	2218.106792823736
The devil wouldn ’ t stop him.	3369.88689539147
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.	6939.703633409509
— God, do you remember?	4092.695009468661
Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard.	11918.542753292491
And by Japers I had no wedding garment.	8799.264885433686
They laughed all three.	6932.288681504905
He had no wed.	4395.747228141082
All trio laughed.	5586.855018890886
No wedding garment.	6380.483134347817
— Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said.	3773.045217009717
Where ’ s my pipe, by the way?	3974.7378741190823
He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe.	8308.372206511453
Bald Pat carried two diners ’ drinks, Richie and Poldy.	13250.916917850607
And Father Cowley laughed again.	4907.178594125566
— I saved the situation, Ben, I think.	3455.8399197780673
— You did, averred Ben Dollard.	4862.461686989238
I remember those tight trousers too.	4367.658909078032
That was a brilliant idea, Bob.	6044.497428574107
Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes.	11922.757835063941
He saved the situa.	6149.24120437236
Tight trou.	13656.980144780464
Brilliant ide.	18679.07077551165
— I knew he was on the rocks, he said.	1618.0096119911238
The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business?	12271.101691322905
Do you remember?	3276.647254129471
We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh ’ s gave us the number.	11945.354506584117
Remember?	9355.265966298623
Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.	13859.541636333179
— By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.	5669.31870964092
Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.	5773.995243645495
— Merrion square style.	4844.159711552049
Balldresses, by God, and court dresses.	13016.427953460041
He wouldn ’ t take any money either.	4856.442218032414
What?	572.8670519115202
Any God ’ s quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose.	11343.839241151443
— Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded.	2617.3326608372304

Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar.	9964.842094246567
So. That will do.	4957.769550172698
Pat, waiter, waited, waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.	9295.980917459434

says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Ay, says I.	735.2921323866182
A bit off the top.	5844.254399389235
An old plumber named Geraghty.	9540.871698474723
I ’ m hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can ’ t get a penny out of him.	4799.05709036842
— That the lay you ’ re on now?	4011.4972719587786
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Ay, says I.	735.2921323866182
How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts.	9985.488022820557
But that ’ s the most notorious bloody robber you ’ d meet in a day ’ s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain.	9558.381723062083
_Tell him, _ says he, _I dare him, _ says he, _and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, _ says he, _I ’ ll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a <URL> And he after stuffing himself till he ’ s fit to burst.	10746.301280454842
Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out.	7946.399860824995
_He drink me my teas.	16054.253491145268
He eat me my sugars.	7504.50379477757
Because he no pay me my moneys? _ For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of <NUM> Saint Kevin ’ s parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E.	12165.659221722062
Geraghty, esquire, of <NUM> Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.	13801.180640127599
— Are you a strict <URL>.?	3563.5068881743005
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Not taking anything between drinks, says I.	3699.855700680446
— What about paying our respects to our friend?	5825.713206670781
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Who?	651.1040733368873
says I.	1123.8704378869784
Sure, he ’ s out in John of God ’ s off his head, poor man.	7060.504311256273
— Drinking his own stuff?	6754.934268378157
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Ay, says I.	735.2921323866182
Whisky and water on the brain.	14315.27510097399
— Come around to Barney Kiernan ’ s, says Joe.	2407.0876642738285
I want to see the citizen.	1676.0147752583212
— Barney mavourneen ’ s be it, says I.	4419.7083167935325
Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?	14046.07559148319
— Not a word, says Joe.	1962.42126782608
I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.	5604.6086314691465
— What was that, Joe?	3039.624501760797
says I.	1123.8704378869784
— Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease.	4958.59004787676
I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.	4804.6167767311545
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another.	10290.631811664398
Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it.	10087.55704316731
Jesus, I couldn ’ t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber.	9376.256915276752
For trading without a licence, says he.	4211.919878319174
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan.	10248.955055911949
There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar.	10469.058286017545
There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown.	13770.77033432104
A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated.	15193.110246101876
In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied.	13866.153740477015
Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects.	15241.007342294153
And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan ’ s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.	13524.395387401968
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O ’ Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains.	13494.33345647911
Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.	15780.001097423963
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.	3414.6134559341303
Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber! And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffe ’ s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M ’ Gillicuddy ’ s reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer ’ s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.	15284.11445584451
So we turned into Barney Kiernan ’ s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.	10564.31055746248
— There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.	7550.026302847293
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.	8816.965445066406
Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog.	11675.870004161734
I ’ m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.	10264.09400382257
— Stand and deliver, says he.	2572.926161316525
— That ’ s all right, citizen, says Joe.	1159.7207246822832
Friends here.	7797.22502355897
— Pass, friends, says he.	2906.961873280069
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he: — What ’ s your opinion of the times?	6508.544934014748
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill.	13479.193248172907
But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.	7865.568624359021
— I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.	7008.987395705187
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says: — Foreign wars is the cause of it.	9849.00627852189
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket: — It ’ s the Russians wish to tyrannise.	6380.422496390764
— Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I.	4776.647233296165
I ’ ve a thirst on me I wouldn ’ t sell for half a crown.	5281.709561604197
— Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.	2944.4317266654343
— Wine of the country, says he.	3044.521876509274
— What ’ s yours?	1585.644104346735
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.	2468.40737598762
— Three pints, Terry, says Joe.	2401.662665199554
And how ’ s the old heart, citizen?	5967.900386588071
says he.	1320.9708158927192
— Never better, _a chara_, says he.	3284.585265675461
What Garry?	4798.520067252702
Are we going to win?	8893.5707653957
Eh?	3630.6576605291275
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.	9163.189035212314
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero.	12077.01729626465
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).	12687.142075383137
The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest.	12300.009007033219
The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower.	11833.233275866132
A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.	14446.66863168582
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes.	13157.833654020867
Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut.	15824.434593328173
His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast.	13316.365177309599
From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O ’ Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O ’ Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O ’ Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M ’ Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.	15097.963185723554
Fursa, S.	6014.824907915698
Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn ’ t, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L.	14725.297230770511
Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W.	15489.620738163278
Shakespeare, Brian Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O ’ Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O ’ Sullivan Beare.	15809.366840970893
A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.	13644.674281284912
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid.	11618.343128702596
O, as true as I ’ m telling you.	3562.817163351597
A goodlooking sovereign.	5632.710288770732
— And there ’ s more where that came from, says he.	3515.8604477188546
— Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe?	7091.400674020576
says I.	1123.8704378869784
— Sweat of my brow, says Joe.	3161.888211524278
’ Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.	11898.10943407355
— I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod ’ s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.	8412.737905635133
Who comes through Michan ’ s land, bedight in sable armour?	12099.164016307937
O ’ Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he.	5864.154813773879
Impervious to fear is Rory ’ s son: he of the prudent soul.	12860.123621555189
— For the old woman of Prince ’ s street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ.	5282.744226835223
The pledgebound party on the floor of the house.	5033.608378988367
And look at this blasted rag, says he.	4231.377823562262
_The Irish Independent, _ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman ’ s friend.	11443.75083401263
Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland Independent, _ and I ’ ll thank you and the marriages.	12161.207182369673
And he starts reading them out: — Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne ’ s on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son.	11135.997896003062
How ’ s that, eh?	2449.544570969675
Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, <NUM> Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude ’ s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester.	15053.822096083304
Eh?	3630.6576605291275
Deaths.	19456.598729469286
Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...	11313.591088945363
— I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.	4228.808998670503
— Cockburn.	3451.237535283804
Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June <NUM>, at <NUM> Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen.	15635.460868378048
How ’ s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How ’ s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?	9131.07043982196
— Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose.	4553.16486805469
Thanks be to God they had the start of us.	8696.580372326092
Drink that, citizen.	6858.739854891435
— I will, says he, honourable person.	2427.2506625069723
— Health, Joe, says I.	2087.924836579146
And all down the form.	5532.046352140706
Ah! Ow! Don ’ t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.	8686.183897138975
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.	14245.598730422362
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.	13581.69772952813
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney ’ s snug, squeezed up with the laughing.	10900.146510802098
And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn ’ t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran.	8432.62254732559
I didn ’ t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door.	4342.842404527103
And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle.	12959.334490144933
I thought Alf would split.	6415.706352649555
— Look at him, says he.	1657.8874480382383
Breen.	16997.075953601605
He ’ s traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U.	6914.8443582135305
p: up on it to take a li...	4704.313491742723
And he doubled up.	2572.405164748082
— Take a what?	3129.989842084034
says I.	1123.8704378869784
— Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.	4950.223323914761
— O hell! says I.	2325.544061445704
The bloody mongrel began to growl that ’ d put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.	12195.559595106528
_ — Bi i dho husht, _ says he.	4235.580346066119
— Who?	651.1040733368873
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Breen, says Alf.	2186.2904683681736
He was in John Henry Menton ’ s and then he went round to Collis and Ward ’ s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff ’ s for a lark.	8213.574211968345
O God, I ’ ve a pain laughing.	4552.905756474428
U.	2812.027642812934
p: up.	2052.4661840413173
The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.	11111.309889279963
— When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy?	9769.925802313468
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up.	5075.835020977511
Is that Alf Bergan?	6773.852213112438
— Yes, says Alf.	654.7080275254349
Hanging?	14336.178182593083
Wait till I show you.	3328.671607656776
That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds.	8375.862393841777
You should have seen long John ’ s eye.	7271.4690392272605
U.	2812.027642812934
p....	885.3396497644454
— Who are you laughing at?	3376.801742167277
says Bob Doran.	3601.632065516818
Is that Bergan?	5666.935766593766
— Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.	4085.023633608984
Terence O ’ Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda.	15758.0119061021
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.	15334.858938738564
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.	14176.899026390482
But he, the young chief of the O ’ Bergan ’ s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze.	11109.209548155086
Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.	14643.242407530968
— What ’ s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?	4029.3897847047333
— What ’ s that?	636.9127384647712
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino.	6087.562928783082
Talking about hanging, I ’ ll show you something you never saw.	8151.425588305033
Hangmen ’ s letters.	14129.550073190665
Look at here.	3059.054624713256
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.	8313.56141750515
— Are you codding?	2945.1120221294673
says I.	1123.8704378869784
— Honest injun, says Alf.	2815.2395044990385
Read them.	4901.764267785988
So Joe took up the letters.	7105.481824362496
— Who are you laughing at?	3376.801742167277
says Bob Doran.	3601.632065516818
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust.	5892.037728001162
Bob ’ s a queer chap when the porter ’ s up in him so says I just to make talk: — How ’ s Willy Murray those times, Alf?	11695.627611564916
— I don ’ t know, says Alf.	1060.6579621827862
Only I was running after that...	4405.111009877159
— You what?	1452.8952714847903
says Joe, throwing down the letters.	5190.331128812127
With who?	6715.524161227342
— With Dignam, says Alf.	2510.7153466196337
— Is it Paddy?	2959.518703577358
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Yes, says Alf.	654.7080275254349
Why?	1336.6418951783915
— Don ’ t you know he ’ s dead?	2175.0874685901967
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.	3914.012585474697
— Ay, says Joe.	608.1724453366666
— Sure I ’ m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.	8479.052620990678
— Who ’ s dead?	1746.3436967114005
says Bob Doran.	3601.632065516818
— You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.	6369.608000895645
— What?	425.82801927876443
says Alf.	1396.747688710013
Good Christ, only five...	3833.4764275163157
What?...	569.5839389281794
And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim ’ s...	4955.859163200377
What?	572.8670519115202
Dignam dead?	8577.658475149054
— What about Dignam?	2613.811851968786
says Bob Doran.	3601.632065516818
Who ’ s talking about...?	2820.2102375092513
— Dead! says Alf.	2447.4016433231736
He ’ s no more dead than you are.	2867.9410388959877
— Maybe so, says Joe.	1822.5612116760706
They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.	9537.794126403329
— Paddy?	2817.987581865323
says Alf.	1396.747688710013
— Ay, says Joe.	608.1724453366666
He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.	6505.790413514318
— Good Christ! says Alf.	2244.5918809188806
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.	14772.459022209527
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face.	12781.737318452935
Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.	16060.908195554175
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels.	13608.271346649826
In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.	12787.150166059064
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.	14241.062028444667
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief.	15035.429792224435
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.	15107.940535447067
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body.	11434.339298621067
Mind C.	6984.340948262981
K.	4761.781141164442
doesn ’ t pile it <URL> It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.	13676.263827068622
J.	306.21619418874246
O ’ Neill ’ s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements.	9225.952053082303
Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen ’ s to be soled only as the heels were still good.	13385.591932515978
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.	12121.246883962549
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.	14550.854297493346
He is gone from mortal haunts: O ’ Dignam, sun of our morning.	8777.194516649393
Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow.	15636.453395632523
Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.	15918.176951963036
— There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.	2497.6411559548137
— Who?	651.1040733368873
— Bloom, says he.	1327.1655445998254
He ’ s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.	4822.969067331724
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.	8630.809900831204
Little Alf was knocked bawways.	12287.867660692335
Faith, he was.	5669.428621533984
— Good Christ! says he.	2308.0888429731085
I could have sworn it was him.	3666.1788779762737
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he ’ s under the influence: — Who said Christ is good?	9352.968336723841
— I beg your parsnips, says Alf.	2351.032025105907
— Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?	6773.554135556145
— Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.	4232.295653838568
He ’ s over all his troubles.	3486.590626180096
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.	3572.023085388269
— He ’ s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.	4368.66508224684
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn ’ t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.	12212.567164805796
And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you ’ re there.	8832.529877701727
— The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.	5300.801248759462
Talking through his bloody hat.	10842.203869089513
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff ’ s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	14329.58613583162
— The noblest, the truest, says he.	2917.0514008753685
And he ’ s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.	5231.537515650522
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.	9939.124398204716
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.	9606.563074133344
— Come in, come on, he won ’ t eat you, says the citizen.	3529.8575535095115
So Bloom slopes in with his cod ’ s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.	9382.977663606873
— O, Christ M ’ Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters.	4728.36418329752
Listen to this, will you?	5291.3813688204
And he starts reading out one.	3507.7992086952954
_<NUM> Hunter Street, <URL> _To the High Sheriff of Dublin, <URL> _Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the <NUM> of Febuary <NUM> and i hanged... _ — Show us, Joe, says I.	10625.431528144547
private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when... _ — Jesus, says I.	8724.765599085507
— _...	884.518159562279
Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith... _ The citizen made a grab at the letter.	10826.99790269314
— Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can ’ t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five <URL> _H.	10610.265804681354
Rumbold, Master <URL> — And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.	7731.330262798532
— And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe.	3324.680330677688
Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf.	6731.449995140384
Gob, he ’ s a prudent member and no mistake.	4486.20249985156
— Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.	3848.6767146999914
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.	8703.76985621972
— They ’ re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.	8602.030486686861
And he was telling us there ’ s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.	10928.602241504428
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor.	9975.901919579741
Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.	14833.818037686315
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I ’ m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don ’ t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.	8992.363364767214
— There ’ s one thing it hasn ’ t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.	4189.696067201743
— What ’ s that?	636.9127384647712
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— The poor bugger ’ s tool that ’ s being hanged, says Alf.	4751.136694059254
— That so?	1158.5013331132407
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— God ’ s truth, says Alf.	2376.1895414636097
I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible.	10855.638993173412
He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.	11361.076531252602
— Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.	4963.092022227901
— That can be explained by science, says Bloom.	3884.0799598071194
It ’ s only a natural phenomenon, don ’ t you see, because on account of the...	2404.428504413258
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.	10252.549614016869
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem <URL> So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other.	13954.526524686753
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought.	13130.314623082717
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs.	15796.586761394494
And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get.	12230.528561412993
Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs ’ tin he told Terry to bring.	10288.285859208545
Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more.	9256.34001158208
Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.	13820.686604514533
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she ’ s far from the land.	12258.1771990324
And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.	7105.204526913283
Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.	15712.344406793982
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk.	13015.152167721672
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.	9351.312202274172
And Bloom with his _but don ’ t you see? _ and _but on the other hand_.	6297.244798817617
And sure, more be token, the lout I ’ m told was in Power ’ s after, the blender ’ s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment.	11968.560306983654
Phenomenon! — The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.	8866.51151529786
— Ay, ay, says Joe.	1146.8752469084366
— You don ’ t grasp my point, says Bloom.	2697.7230271183234
What I mean is...	2169.369317211812
— _Sinn Fein! _ says the citizen.	3607.2623058625495
_Sinn Fein amhain! _ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.	14067.756805040155
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.	7438.441307986226
The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.	13953.887982621589
A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons.	12997.243447188277
A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza ’ s plaintive muse.	14860.930362984855
Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L - n - h - n and M - ll - g - n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth - provoking fashion.	16200.234920667292
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies.	14727.361501963189
The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day ’ s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.	14055.247440574683
The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.	13758.6307339604
The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad - Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.	14210.601675734204
Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Señor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli - Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein.	16647.498379847504
All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness.	12157.048243773133
An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F.	11497.06407099799
O.	898.7620042054172
T.	2808.5869331601516
E.	1948.1085920489277
I.	442.8329584233336
as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland ’ s patron saint.	12794.356485724269
In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged.	12854.357964746796
The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties.	13170.216085386075
The readywitted ninefooter ’ s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted.	11416.682422956563
Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.	12042.960190660584
O.	898.7620042054172
T.	2808.5869331601516
E.	1948.1085920489277
I., several of whom were bleeding profusely.	8100.354088821227
Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses.	15282.975727046864
The objects (which included several hundred ladies ’ and gentlemen ’ s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.	13751.82929568102
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus Cruentus_.	14555.766300503808
He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate — short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man.	12100.639983303836
The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.	14786.769378728954
It was exactly seventeen o ’ clock.	4636.366612698607
The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore ’ s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi.	14069.897481705239
The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.	13797.604251697108
Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously.	15728.050401326187
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.	13140.10389695202
On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim.	14458.02945095775
The housesteward of the amalgamated cats ’ and dogs ’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.	13374.156518034832
Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers ’ association as a token of his regard and esteem.	15422.716770391606
The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake.	13476.191817231807
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.	11876.765568544397
Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach.	16794.212806290223
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.	13501.841302815988
She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment.	14079.971726970014
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time.	8361.581107542544
A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself.	13242.620936625823
Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage.	13361.976693827639
Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion ’ s history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.	13105.299842902135
Nay, even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin - Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.	15328.726035062396
With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage, _ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone: — God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.	13996.561483844594
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can ’ t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.	13039.723325646937
Antitreating is about the size of it.	6479.36767257017
Gob, he ’ d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you ’ d ever see the froth of his pint.	11091.234855301971
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don ’ t be talking.	11258.98465372398
Ireland sober is Ireland free.	11955.44046585049
And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.	10677.987503496137
And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.	11034.652187120313
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me.	10242.04901558897
I ’ d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog.	6321.118654162674
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn ’ t blind him.	8873.286282963627
— Afraid he ’ ll bite you?	4405.713917298385
says the citizen, jeering.	3940.978725828947
— No, says I.	789.5162785308073
But he might take my leg for a lamppost.	9304.604328138144
So he calls the old dog over.	6404.999368760951
— What ’ s on you, Garry?	2421.1798197892826
says he.	1320.9708158927192
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.	10611.01035189634
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.	10695.155532523957
Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that.	12113.984715016835
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.	13546.813233501627
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry.	14932.211619399903
The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.	12620.478662572834
Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards.	15625.15143147998
We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D.	13211.839243758386
O.	898.7620042054172
C.	957.8630399978279
points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.	14209.058061054915
We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication.	14148.928689614242
The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught.	14045.461768030083
Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen ’ s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.	14729.445985126924
The curse of my curses Seven days every day And seven dry Thursdays On you, Barney Kiernan, Has no sup of water To cool my courage, And my guts red roaring After Lowry ’ s lights.	13941.009293125413
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off.	11119.88689398192
And Joe asked him would he have another.	7278.200949146301
— I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there ’ s no ill feeling.	4470.0813535894085
Gob, he ’ s not as green as he ’ s cabbagelooking.	5193.525891600115
Entertainment for man and beast.	14821.525757584073
And says Joe: — Could you make a hole in another pint?	10175.613814121472
— Could a swim duck?	6753.213711358395
says I.	1123.8704378869784
— Same again, Terry, says Joe.	2527.7701719909587
Are you sure you won ’ t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment?	7765.291043906106
says he.	1320.9708158927192
— Thank you, no, says Bloom.	1999.3170134003715
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don ’ t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam ’ s.	5449.8209668507025
Martin asked me to go to the house.	5508.20016742599
You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn ’ t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can ’ t recover on the policy.	9771.314123355569
— Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that ’ s a good one if old Shylock is landed.	5241.268704228108
So the wife comes out top dog, what?	8198.822438341693
— Whose admirers?	4353.223300165244
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— The wife ’ s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.	3039.6854953042425
He was bloody safe he wasn ’ t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court.	9176.498088864799
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery.	12315.804823622282
O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.	9795.231055582619
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that ’ s dead to tell her.	11449.918367822649
Choking with bloody foolery.	17932.704941932887
And shaking Bloom ’ s hand doing the tragic to tell her that.	5673.690324995064
Shake hands, brother.	10932.153323709108
You ’ re a rogue and I ’ m another.	3259.73236287998
— Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour.	12336.510287427103
But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.	12339.631211892825
— No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.	12489.261353093552
— Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.	5756.431130248449
The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.	13909.947992538995
And off with him and out trying to walk straight.	8757.156119882178
Boosed at five o ’ clock.	9975.028358400907
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, <NUM> A.	12566.454591501186
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups.	15089.221395011844
And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve ’ s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging.	11746.12447090703
And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.	10253.306965470862
_How is your testament?	17933.156992363685
Have you got an old testament? _ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what.	10136.081222929946
Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady.	13357.91618111718
Jack Mooney ’ s sister.	10267.200164748505
And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples.	9177.303869318552
Gob, Jack made him toe the line.	8627.516046783074
Told him if he didn ’ t patch up the pot, Jesus, he ’ d kick the shite out of him.	7055.691978358482
So Terry brought the three pints.	9613.48706733983
— Here, says Joe, doing the honours.	4150.450171062981
Here, citizen.	3479.968801693748
— _Slan leat_, says he.	2339.2958257910723
— Fortune, Joe, says I.	1908.0352290248995
Good health, citizen.	5119.7296586745215
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already.	7598.8450914516425
Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.	11983.19326194693
— Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf?	6820.049581164785
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Friend of yours, says Alf.	3427.1939911408563
— Nannan?	3118.5687368668796
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
The mimber?	4122.464502427211
— I won ’ t mention any names, says Alf.	2601.512720396795
— I thought so, says Joe.	1286.2653385744097
I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M.	6157.335514729138
P., the cattle traders.	6222.1075963195935
— Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.	7410.810392022894
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.	12777.697338496924
Because he was up one time in a knacker ’ s yard.	10315.493652265139
Walking about with his book and pencil here ’ s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier.	13575.74084468851
Mister Knowall.	18679.07077551165
Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks.	17453.148558096593
Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O ’ Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her.	11329.746777536418
Couldn ’ t loosen her farting strings but old cod ’ s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it.	9418.10288989974
What ’ s your programme today?	2955.5089758584413
Ay. Humane methods.	10403.016355569374
Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn ’ t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently.	11937.203095077128
Gob, he ’ d have a soft hand under a hen.	6690.270206085844
Klook Klook Klook.	9210.046066817547
Black Liz is our hen.	13493.782128667197
She lays eggs for us.	5116.896586836957
When she lays her egg she is so glad.	12252.392141453349
Gara.	15443.024084639697
Klook Klook Klook.	9210.046066817547
Then comes good uncle Leo.	8857.516807152319
He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg.	10135.339497782023
Ga ga ga ga Gara.	16054.114744045648
— Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going?	5159.073018601641
I wanted to see him, as it happens.	5300.58447991181
— Well, he ’ s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.	3887.8423641971217
— That ’ s too bad, says Bloom.	1656.2869750638872
I wanted particularly.	4764.643175065584
Perhaps only Mr Field is going.	11907.100576231398
I couldn ’ t phone.	3427.7484569406406
No. You ’ re sure?	4955.6927547470295
— Nannan ’ s going too, says Joe.	2844.6773637748365
The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park.	9770.52317898641
What do you think of that, citizen?	4186.718207812848
_The Sluagh na h - Eireann_.	12151.18975111684
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham.	8137.910758423958
Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?	14070.443922966708
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.	8277.958716403939
Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house.	13291.969002930522
I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that.	5127.969777028848
The answer to the honourable member ’ s question is in the affirmative.	10308.427260080653
Mr Orelli O ’ Reilly (Montenotte.	9420.608243426193
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?	14655.695276518034
Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman ’ s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench?	12349.444865230442
(O! O!) Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.	11051.181430706069
Mr Staylewit (Buncombe.	8277.916980094644
Ind.): Don ’ t hesitate to shoot.	9197.013369739974
(Ironical opposition cheers.) The speaker: Order! Order! (The house rises.	14695.937696935087
Cheers.) — There ’ s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival.	7514.818657431794
There he is sitting there.	3427.134795417968
The man that got away James Stephens.	4725.147564862826
The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot.	9235.061477868912
What was your best throw, citizen?	6508.253104621764
— _Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest.	5048.332657558149
There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.	7060.152919794405
— Put it there, citizen, says Joe.	2820.7184714532023
You were and a bloody sight better.	7105.411839322823
— Is that really a fact?	3307.2813646569703
says Alf.	1396.747688710013
— Yes, says Bloom.	660.0523804433988
Did you not know that?	4989.101066587607
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that.	12614.7650038548
And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower ’ s heart violent exercise was bad.	11770.796096557975
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.	10664.521964861206
Do you see that straw?	5564.815674384962
That ’ s a straw_.	1846.9725796396206
Declare to my aunt he ’ d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.	13864.149071136624
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian O ’ Ciarnain ’ s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of _Sluagh na h - Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.	12161.969043693529
The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions.	10477.421400315692
After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers.	14839.636037909086
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M ’ Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages.	13870.875347018253
L.	2728.379725348002
Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis ’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.	14658.570612871372
The Irish Caruso - Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it.	11983.64071810053
His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions.	13424.97007957332
The proceedings then terminated.	6549.046155587141
Amongst the clergy present were the very rev.	10180.560886961059

— Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh - Bennett match?	8646.418476332112
— No, says Joe.	653.0221453460563
— I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.	5383.719149150651
— Who?	651.1040733368873
Blazes?	10426.63014497102
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
And says Bloom: — What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.	8503.256195693875
— Ay, Blazes, says Alf.	1973.6632845218514
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.	8080.080257701773
— We know him, says the citizen.	1710.3449752405
The traitor ’ s son.	3429.171152498395
We know what put English gold in his pocket.	6677.6449561290965
— True for you, says Joe.	1478.0115841475904
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf: — Now, don ’ t you think, Bergan?	8359.2569049193
Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it.	10126.426881488744
Handed him the father and mother of a beating.	13161.707427056728
See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping.	11431.471856176517
God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.	11191.287566710484
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.	11345.552115791395
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin ’ s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.	14358.69310044946
The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions.	10785.311854429401
The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet ’ s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.	14439.657418016408
The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett ’ s jaw.	12865.62333008033
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.	10417.224938648802
The men came to handigrips.	7054.986185259707
Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him.	13747.48720994033
The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime.	13646.186471987883
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.	5500.067930315141
The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.	8663.474571005574
The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.	11993.43535709973
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent ’ s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett ’ s stomach, flooring him flat.	14187.588267481831
Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett ’ s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.	15143.59084757694
— He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.	3942.770385332361
— He is, says Joe.	1053.248761705516
Isn ’ t he?	3372.9987045164853
— Who?	651.1040733368873
says Bloom.	1487.750629220957
Ah, yes.	1746.0403878931775
That ’ s quite true.	2092.194740274424
Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see.	3904.2423537847258

says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— My wife?	2805.4116669479386
says Bloom.	1487.750629220957
She ’ s singing, yes.	2586.9987249045143
I think it will be a success too.	4546.407735514913

And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.	10322.64293577703
— Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing.	4164.339920372141
God, I ’ d give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.	7227.5723724851805
— Was it you did it, Alf?	6332.926735869889
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.	10940.181809311163
— Me?	2280.104392310563
says Alf.	1396.747688710013
Don ’ t cast your nasturtiums on my character.	6410.260120490496
— Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.	6507.153031785002
— Of course an action would lie, says J.	3926.0115642146766
J.	306.21619418874246
It implies that he is not _compos mentis_.	9202.148955362403

p: up.	2052.4661840413173
_ — Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing.	5607.181106782588
Do you know that he ’ s balmy?	4645.521736406302
Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.	8321.81485226832
— Yes, says J.	585.0506928472806
J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.	8271.417898968177
— Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.	3035.8911547124835
— Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.	5136.513533073518
— Pity about her, says the citizen.	2574.9203802387333
Or any other woman marries a half and half.	11217.46941504015
— How half and half?	4496.5636974880035
says Bloom.	1487.750629220957
Do you mean he...	1669.2921489435328
— Half and half I mean, says the citizen.	2629.7340916383896
A fellow that ’ s neither fish nor flesh.	6352.885069117088
— Nor good red herring, says Joe.	3161.3721083875266
A pishogue, if you know what that is.	3971.4329506958284
Begob I saw there was trouble coming.	12065.095077110296
And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool.	11237.892678003738
Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain.	14032.951280390074
And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow ’ s was pewopener to the pope.	11275.030886285955
Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney ’ s moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.	13740.465804841771
And who was he, tell us?	7411.727902119757
A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.	9725.741161840864
— And moreover, says J.	1698.2550911023632
J., a postcard is publication.	6144.35405219883
It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v.	10231.638008971073
Hole.	19456.598729469286
In my opinion an action might lie.	9048.257001769542
Six and eightpence, please.	8243.966960668557
Who wants your opinion?	9185.321477845457
Let us drink our pints in peace.	8782.72434139427
Gob, we won ’ t be let even do that much itself.	8053.660568725633
— Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.	3654.446470788152
— Good health, Ned, says J.	2560.8560050070605
J.	306.21619418874246
— - There he is again, says Joe.	2572.6989317350126
— Where?	1385.740520633735
says Alf.	1396.747688710013
And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.	12035.930945587788
— How did that Canada swindle case go off?	6170.064407571355
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Remanded, says J.	1953.6474119797879
J.	306.21619418874246
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he ’ d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob.	11206.131845395139
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?	8625.426155615756
Course it was a bloody barney.	10370.549229048427
What?	572.8670519115202
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too.	11776.951721597701
J.	306.21619418874246
J.	306.21619418874246
was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.	13592.996731890902
— Who tried the case?	4566.26029930634
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Recorder, says Ned.	3042.334899535929
— Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.	6758.456044709654
— Heart as big as a lion, says Ned.	5517.696259569492
— Ay, says Alf.	854.5064829983643
Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn ’ t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that ’ s minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.	10538.6655379061
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry: — A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?	10992.77941324603
Ten, did you say?	9866.156282331001
— Yes, your worship.	2143.124871019714
And my wife has the typhoid.	8621.165063188944
— And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir.	6080.16555421002
No, sir, I ’ ll make no order for payment.	4106.61930234354
How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.	10972.696522320424
And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law.	13002.90587073743
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.	14253.122657736249
And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.	11442.926540395232
And he sat him there about the hour of five o ’ clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin.	10257.441905036801
And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true.	7164.375946748985
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book.	12761.086575268637
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness.	11490.512372537172
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received.	12330.339464683546
And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.	11235.628865855511
— Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.	7935.518619494122
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn ’ t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford.	13190.244173217814
And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he ’ d do the devil and all.	9247.929970490204
— Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition.	7499.877039098583
That ’ s the whole secret.	2157.539767436891
— Rely on me, says Joe.	2631.503250031061
— Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland.	4253.386926538395
We want no more strangers in our house.	8855.176862070834
— O, I ’ m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom.	2704.3083452218707
It ’ s just that Keyes, you see.	2717.0502503499033
— Consider that done, says Joe.	2630.663989339544
— Very kind of you, says Bloom.	2631.7060765781353
— The strangers, says the citizen.	1490.746464958474
Our own fault.	9173.603954465914
We let them come in.	5767.892413774174
We brought them in.	5077.611170471347
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.	7776.268046571782
— Decree _nisi, _ says J.	3247.6174044468585
J.	306.21619418874246
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider ’ s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.	11017.003079382108
— A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that ’ s what ’ s the cause of all our misfortunes.	3803.390920735049
— And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_ with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.	8047.298653062086

So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.	10988.281069268121
— Well, says the citizen, what ’ s the latest from the scene of action?	3613.3579521271663
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?	10162.911394039987
O ’ Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.	14031.612292046004
— It ’ s on the march, says the citizen.	1783.01349336752
To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their <URL> So J.	8011.393877415496
J.	306.21619418874246
puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.	15549.161783115173
— Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen.	3127.8019738497833
To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores ’ gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name.	12037.251923855874
Any civilisation they have they stole from us.	10189.012112789265

You wouldn ’ t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d ’ <URL> And says John Wyse: — Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.	11428.84727297429
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo: — _Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion! _ He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.	14131.621526462868
— What ’ s up with you, says I to Lenehan.	2743.535582194556
You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.	11210.181839707035
— Gold cup, says he.	2339.3754352796886
— Who won, Mr Lenehan?	5102.128366636805

The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley.	13632.545972322223
Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey - Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence.	16329.919750763462
The bride who was given away by her father, the M ’ Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze.	14775.846858838288
The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.	13715.303439896661
Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of _Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service.	14982.69731279931
On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.	14756.042835379329
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.	11963.048429945717
— And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.	3175.494648435868
We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.	14065.010335328274
— And will again, says Joe.	1435.369030169716
— And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh.	6499.045281830714
Our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O ’ Reillys and the O ’ Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.	14474.770598567713
And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor ’ s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.	12103.037056440799

What will you have?	6222.078194807589
— An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.	8530.617173994237
— Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.	4813.127436105732
Terry! Are you asleep?	14677.998336870327
— Yes, sir, says Terry.	1460.6832725046254
Small whisky and bottle of Allsop.	13840.216322476495

Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.	10341.303711889715
— But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?	8355.620848882258
— I ’ ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.	1572.7746014022864
Hell upon earth it is.	6140.779781022487
Read the revelations that ’ s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth.	10031.56937034427
A fellow writes that calls himself _Disgusted One_.	9375.108430733733
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.	13672.338367515955
— A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God ’ s Englishman calls it caning on the breech.	9176.873246457231
And says John Wyse: — ’ Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.	10034.527894883586
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.	12325.94020594326
— That ’ s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.	3141.2678035226595
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God ’ s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.	10234.789825177082
That ’ s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.	6235.674293222566
— On which the sun never rises, says Joe.	3893.5457784280416
— And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.	3534.7182868446594
The unfortunate yahoos believe it.	3453.783267587799
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.	13283.45538243841
— But, says Bloom, isn ’ t discipline the same everywhere.	5261.381472377132
I mean wouldn ’ t it be the same here if you put force against force?	7312.545563977084
Didn ’ t I tell you?	3875.058089793724
As true as I ’ m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he ’ d try to downface you that dying was living.	9447.046591468054
— We ’ ll put force against force, says the citizen.	2772.234046091523
We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea.	5860.740748008076
They were driven out of house and home in the black <NUM>.	7576.542620507104
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America.	14701.47859328448
Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres.	12864.676681341345
But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.	12883.460371757028
Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes.	12175.51390172242
Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships.	15377.779542073453
But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage.	7772.679104673024
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.	10941.263408768491
— Perfectly true, says Bloom.	2835.3802535758737
But my point was...	2402.14925485576
— We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned.	5509.864307839511
— Ay, says John Wyse.	1482.7963198431175
We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us.	11432.147624189678
Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone.	13373.450986958851
We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese.	11562.545806231456
Fontenoy, eh?	7052.373937773298
And Sarsfield and O ’ Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa.	12303.775477718484
But what did we ever get for it?	6899.513594387988
— The French! says the citizen.	1980.4109824692482
Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is?	9005.3316687221
They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.	8044.749711710023
— _Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.	8361.618458213461
— And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven ’ t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that ’ s dead?	9136.466097180873
Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.	13576.581921161956
— Well, says J.	798.4393015189422

We have Edward the peacemaker now.	5421.999997139387
— Tell that to a fool, says the citizen.	3023.898217548021
Edward Guelph - Wettin! — And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty ’ s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode.	11868.1708734912
The earl of Dublin, no less.	6237.78391247555
— They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.	7158.984397811691
And says J.	1261.4016166421754
J.: — Considerations of space influenced their lordships ’ decision.	9653.91973313297
— Will you try another, citizen?	5176.743218720431
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Yes, sir, says he.	695.5591485994926
I will.	1457.0657355478136
— You?	1440.5233831414735
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
— Beholden to you, Joe, says I.	2753.279889460952
May your shadow never grow less.	12984.097980309383
— Repeat that dose, says Joe.	2630.6197797388927
— Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.	4155.582426489683
Perpetuating national hatred among nations.	17724.87334026543
— But do you know what a nation means?	5754.327036885815
says John Wyse.	2863.4510329911545
— Yes, says Bloom.	660.0523804433988
— What is it?	570.4162250476427
says John Wyse.	2863.4510329911545
— A nation?	2785.4677211084277
says Bloom.	1487.750629220957
A nation is the same people living in the same place.	6608.958333225725
— By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that ’ s so I ’ m a nation for I ’ m living in the same place for the past five years.	6182.081242554024
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it: — Or also living in different places.	10338.990763495087
— What is your nation if I may ask?	4895.10422713417
says the citizen.	1091.93139367687
— Ireland, says Bloom.	2204.2513366325825
Ireland.	6021.849578591646
The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.	9778.476341210862
— After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.	6200.25094647044
— Here you are, citizen, says Joe.	2168.869070135684
Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.	11856.466684126974
The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration.	13933.91634151858
No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill.	14358.81805454409
The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides.	13955.270455551667
Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland ’ s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh ’ s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde ’ s tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun ’ s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch ’ s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury ’ s Hotel, S.	14569.76454105727
Patrick ’ s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley ’ s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal ’ s Cave — all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.	14499.14695588951
— Show us over the drink, says I.	3617.3867396352935
Which is which?	12352.157492577991
— That ’ s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.	4160.7596139595025
Also now.	3994.039651586504
This very moment.	4804.594662463128
This very instant.	7188.095674745643
Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.	9812.6153046159
— Robbed, says he.	1769.2130056888216
Plundered.	19456.598729469286
Insulted.	19456.598729469286
Persecuted.	19456.598729469286
Taking what belongs to us by right.	10853.191953643453
At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.	10590.938456216603
— Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?	5182.374074245223
says the citizen.	1091.93139367687
— I ’ m talking about injustice, says Bloom.	1836.6587068278873
— Right, says John Wyse.	2445.254220647145
Stand up to it then with force like men.	11899.74377248839
That ’ s an almanac picture for you.	2506.5895461789164
Mark for a softnosed bullet.	15161.793838952624
Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun.	9406.35600931735
Gob, he ’ d adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse ’ s apron on him.	7346.1651108772785
And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.	10606.119004935543
— But it ’ s no use, says he.	2293.5133528301603
Force, hatred, history, all that.	9959.121769452073
That ’ s not life for men and women, insult and hatred.	6093.502986908138
And everybody knows that it ’ s the very opposite of that that is really life.	6742.438663710536
— What?	425.82801927876443
says Alf.	1396.747688710013
— Love, says Bloom.	2080.10175253339
I mean the opposite of hatred.	5936.04808293335
I must go now, says he to John Wyse.	5055.860417890555
Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there.	8357.799488045026
If he comes just say I ’ ll be back in a second.	5961.656653100102
Just a moment.	2836.1258958401077
Who ’ s hindering you?	3477.980618669925
And off he pops like greased lightning.	9267.046615300755
— A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen.	3232.0655590416477
Universal love.	10940.817986651593
— Well, says John Wyse.	1541.841115087451
Isn ’ t that what we ’ re told.	8455.129528968331
Love your neighbour.	10226.668776036337
— That chap?	2452.0519296984453
says the citizen.	1091.93139367687
Beggar my neighbour is his motto.	14159.848084587537
Love, moya! He ’ s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.	8300.798447230121
Love loves to love love.	9156.240473598953
Nurse loves the new chemist.	16729.08845792394
Constable <NUM> A loves Mary Kelly.	14895.054222533474
Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.	12686.433898345316
M.	1419.2444105626132
B.	1761.314203247806
loves a fair gentleman.	14933.616781574548
Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye.	11754.232784662896
The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead.	5720.537511358019
His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen.	10174.414491216607
Mrs Norman W.	5830.727520170264
Tupper loves officer Taylor.	12217.779241717799
You love a certain person.	7711.264313047294
And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.	11880.847259066426
— Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song.	4664.022963831123
More power, citizen.	5494.426234157896
— Hurrah, there, says Joe.	2329.0578327108014
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.	8216.78143348355
— We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.	5578.308287120877
What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_ pasted round the mouth of his cannon?	12911.239269829224
The bible! Did you read that skit in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that ’ s visiting England?	10963.93941083032
— What ’ s that?	636.9127384647712
says Joe.	682.7462112277932
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out: — A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions.	13761.533493954841
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England ’ s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor.	12791.55783353276
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors ’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.	13589.131914937176
— Widow woman, says Ned.	3759.4109137231667
I wouldn ’ t doubt her.	2557.015950541723
Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.	12420.937126336481
— Same only more so, says Lenehan.	4404.661840077242
And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.	11425.178741241862
— Is that by Griffith?	3758.9772658113666
says John Wyse.	2863.4510329911545
— No, says the citizen.	795.89553885454
It ’ s not signed Shanganagh.	2842.835342040523
It ’ s only initialled: P.	2995.257797832627
— And a very good initial too, says Joe.	2735.1940660237165
— That ’ s how it ’ s worked, says the citizen.	1949.8502829973393
Trade follows the flag.	16761.066103886442
— Well, says J.	798.4393015189422
J., if they ’ re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad.	9616.94906144561
Did you read that report by a man what ’ s this his name is?	7725.090722779895
— Casement, says the citizen.	1701.3921124118594
He ’ s an Irishman.	2257.002377218978
— Yes, that ’ s the man, says J.	1153.1052188078422
J.	306.21619418874246
Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.	11832.847265670147
— I know where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.	4052.3567516811595
— Who?	651.1040733368873
says I.	1123.8704378869784
— Bloom, says he.	1327.1655445998254
The courthouse is a blind.	5900.723210427637
He had a few bob on _Throwaway_ and he ’ s gone to gather in the shekels.	7388.073377983835
— Is it that whiteeyed kaffir?	4786.232524607132
says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?	7789.259301916024
— That ’ s where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan.	2206.320474605719
I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.	10287.04110793851
He ’ s the only man in Dublin has it.	2280.2975751907566
A dark horse.	4043.1242040680363
— He ’ s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.	1872.142603718218
— Mind, Joe, says I.	1995.9611530142633
Show us the entrance out.	8404.744909081131
— There you are, says Terry.	3838.3396371179165
Goodbye Ireland I ’ m going to Gort.	7921.024551771089
So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my _ (Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery ’ s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she ’ s better_ or _she ’ s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there ’ s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.	13931.017857573863
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries.	13432.781225946082
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.	16728.365842815565
Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.	11322.91498648929
Give us a bloody chance.	6811.296062998663
God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout.	12451.077967512154
Mr Bloom with his argol bargol.	4721.664141724103
And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds.	13319.469968364778
Loans by post on easy terms.	17570.84762702354
Any amount of money advanced on note of hand.	11228.28331250424
Distance no object.	15498.856387374859
No security.	6159.577739645505
Gob, he ’ s like Lanty MacHale ’ s goat that ’ d go a piece of the road with every one.	7794.777289200203
— Well, it ’ s a fact, says John Wyse.	1963.5068462628997
And there ’ s the man now that ’ ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.	5028.023940589756
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general ’ s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king ’ s expense.	13109.483639150407
Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.	13901.353007370746
— Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.	10853.400946335281
Saucy knave! To us! So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.	16602.790744223406
Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.	14649.891306460777
— Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.	8882.55106634476
— Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked.	9381.057121566402
Look to our steeds.	10735.205185569115
— Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder.	10549.139292113468
I know not what to offer your lordships.	7090.303959512521
— How now, fellow?	3945.427617052259
cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king ’ s messengers, master Taptun?	12285.55449014214
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord ’ s visage.	12961.194174975875
— Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly.	6567.3641233846565
An you be the king ’ s messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught.	12190.815641662472
The king ’ s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.	9366.02305423088
— Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect.	10907.1867725916
Hast aught to give us?	13851.652233685374
Mine host bowed again as he made answer: — What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog ’ s bacon, a boar ’ s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?	14756.94622135221
— Gadzooks! cried the last speaker.	7877.933002267931
That likes me well.	5525.477769004484
Pistachios! — Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance.	15343.239940548165
A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! ’ Tis a merry rogue.	11485.363760131053
So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.	8036.0461312293055
— Where is he?	1631.1790872682786
says Lenehan.	3348.351066971968
Defrauding widows and orphans.	17932.61452774436
— Isn ’ t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?	7688.705096190139
— That ’ s so, says Martin.	1665.5389864915367
Or so they allege.	8841.640111023073
— I, says Joe.	848.7142608004581
I ’ m the alligator.	1968.41576369235
— And after all, says John Wyse, why can ’ t a jew love his country like the next fellow?	6941.360022294239
— Why not?	1639.7895099349691
says J.	1290.1884899553636
— Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he?	8792.689330917106
says Ned.	2702.3876296292265
Or who is he?	4439.917491684561
No offence, Crofton.	8559.39203449033
— Who is Junius?	3163.061916960102
says J.	1290.1884899553636
— We don ’ t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.	5594.001531525665
— He ’ s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system.	6741.360126442797
We know that in the castle.	7021.589729179037
— Isn ’ t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist?	6640.063962693416
says Jack Power.	6045.824964084509
— Not at all, says Martin.	3009.9476347818527
Only namesakes.	9935.810101976167
His name was Virag, the father ’ s name that poisoned himself.	6572.011064088561
He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.	7358.378875036471
— That ’ s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen.	2364.584936513185
Island of saints and sages! — Well, they ’ re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin.	10612.768117554037
For that matter so are we.	9184.022586750574
— Yes, says J.	585.0506928472806
J., and every male that ’ s born they think it may be their Messiah.	7962.78139915677
And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he ’ s a father or a mother.	8970.199927853055
— Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.	7077.266797081495
— O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born.	6681.034279696757
I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave ’ s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.	11445.144269419634
— _En ventre sa mère_, says J.	3707.3058946963774
J.	306.21619418874246
— Do you call that a man?	4146.207223943018
says the citizen.	1091.93139367687
— I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.	3251.2149421475633
— Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.	6100.42527282619
— And who does he suspect?	4779.005894215351
says the citizen.	1091.93139367687
Gob, there ’ s many a true word spoken in jest.	6995.552102846639
One of those mixed middlings he is.	4483.813374885903
Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses.	12761.435536808061
Do you know what I ’ m telling you?	2485.487784519613
It ’ d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea.	8522.839668039036
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man.	9550.09022056945
Give us your blessing.	8889.062604836981
— Charity to the neighbour, says Martin.	5566.354029504088
But where is he?	4169.95630326928
We can ’ t wait.	3999.9424547888734
— A wolf in sheep ’ s clothing, says the citizen.	3515.7602394344117
That ’ s what he is.	1608.4689668019075
Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him.	9028.97220732978
Cursed by God.	10013.789557349555
— Have you time for a brief libation, Martin?	6879.379916170421

God bless all here is my prayer.	11545.581195253937

And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S.	13750.29153160096

Ursula with eleven thousand virgins.	15550.35106674391
And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags ’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns.	15657.653049663795
And as they wended their way by Nelson ’ s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying.	14583.242495978107
And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O ’ Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick.	11746.437896718011
And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein.	12580.576435242887
And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.	10962.364524385512
— _Adiutorium nostrum in nomine <URL> — _Qui fecit cœlum et <URL> — _Dominus <URL> — _Et cum spiritu <URL> And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed: — _Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum <URL> — And so say all of us, says Jack.	14495.635249161161
— Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.	9387.164614502532
— Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson.	6353.885104622895
And butter for fish.	6939.079598784372
I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.	9291.941933996715
— I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you.	3240.6392296965796
I hope I ’ m not...	1440.7600017243808
— No, says Martin, we ’ re ready.	3586.0237739508666
Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.	15373.700112085919
Mean bloody scut.	16807.8688531982
Stand us a drink itself.	12669.705200497905
Devil a sweet fear! There ’ s a jew for you! All for number one.	7596.036506788466
Cute as a shithouse rat.	15793.739147241147
Hundred to five.	10502.702539917464
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen.	1722.9308055307454
— Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue.	6704.115017020441
Come along now.	3878.0640521175806
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him.	2873.5757929802335
It ’ s a secret.	1690.9428699825282
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.	8312.413522358662
— Bye bye all, says Martin.	4558.701868934628
And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.	9979.159002982182
— Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.	5651.012047424438
The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard.	13790.724018379378
A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair.	14848.035190617336
Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.	14817.031450902585
And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.	9392.852535516258
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.	11559.119059157214
— Let me alone, says he.	2251.004624230516
And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him: — Three cheers for Israel! Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ ’ sake and don ’ t be making a public exhibition of yourself.	9858.846934460713
Jesus, there ’ s always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing.	10216.251430322794
Gob, it ’ d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.	9785.115996242726
And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her: — Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister! And says he: — Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza.	12432.555788373218
And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew.	5855.527225375633
Your God.	5144.650306396521
— He had no father, says Martin.	3583.553739854531
That ’ ll do now.	1993.6961023141134
Drive ahead.	14855.255256694074
— Whose God?	3789.746852952972
says the citizen.	1091.93139367687
— Well, his uncle was a jew, says he.	2590.5074126002232
Your God was a jew.	6633.708709682855
Christ was a jew like me.	7220.816724876073
Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.	10151.05954339388
— By Jesus, says he, I ’ ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.	5227.828372680044
By Jesus, I ’ ll crucify him so I will.	4897.573394118708
Give us that biscuitbox here.	5563.782295783939
— Stop! Stop! says Joe.	3790.5089771656926
The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was characterised by the most affecting cordiality.	11928.1999830635
An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.	15165.43817461299
The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_, followed immediately by _Rakóczsy ’ s March_.	14463.601296623126
Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M ’ Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.	15000.856489967815
Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.	15838.850147767553
_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra! _ Gone but not forgotten.	16038.911684554278
And Ned and J.	3550.7618885201077
J.	306.21619418874246
paralysed with the laughing.	10947.69016293407
— Bloody wars, says I, I ’ ll be in for the last gospel.	4667.653949673275
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag ’ s head round the other way and off with him.	7872.527502149487
— Hold on, citizen, says Joe.	2070.8982157405294
Stop! Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly.	12595.655547887747
Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he ’ d have left him for dead.	9835.347826873964
Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford.	8317.770903321063
The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.	9900.130796662595
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect.	9027.853366995083
The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli ’ s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of <NUM>, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas.	12968.05017461125
The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn ’ s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch.	13135.724546775316
All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.	11847.963232110955
From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character.	12108.719974421063
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant ’ s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale.	14669.048312238681
Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west.	15011.262651666435
Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.	15405.929478471948
The work of salvage, removal of _débris, _ human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, <NUM> Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T.	11928.918758586173

Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he ’ d remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting.	11758.268580242653
The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses.	10366.888427882417
What?	572.8670519115202
O, Jesus, he did.	3411.9232215494635
And he let a volley of oaths after him.	5110.285188938648
— Did I kill him, says he, or what?	3708.2774691498157
And he shouting to the bloody dog: — After him, Garry! After him, boy! And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.	13199.460835748501
Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.	8339.014518664875
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven.	13306.293796068481
And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him.	11974.096406406912
And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah! Elijah! _ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai! _ And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe ’ s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.	13225.469462140436
The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.	11415.78453947856
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.	12923.144482357313
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.	11906.666168778045
Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _H.	14239.647207474456
M.	1419.2444105626132
S.	1192.4711296144715
Belleisle_ printed on both.	14933.08986690214
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.	12520.995049776631
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long.	12842.102979964078
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight.	10176.496710238187
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.	10611.29119898439
Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.	12750.826017781335
— Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.	3606.869802240218
Say out big, big.	12322.480842193205
I want a drink of water.	4733.274572055803
And baby prattled after her: — A jink a jink a jawbo.	9875.672117083319
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on.	14059.629748649546
What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib.	11666.072030040945
None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.	13414.623913157833
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.	12226.210034418522
And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.	9223.411367567081
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky.	10267.194645913538
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule.	15947.940058852657
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had.	12276.033439980562
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman ’ s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too.	13336.822773191812
— Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.	7568.686518039171
At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.	13063.25712821131
Wait till I catch you for that.	4572.189197585152
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister ’ s word was law with the twins.	12638.598831014504
And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure.	9096.373229321378
His little man - o ’ - war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life ’ s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.	13022.205177476382
Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn ’ t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.	12833.995035519132
— Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.	4998.20070136982
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly: — What ’ s your name?	6777.821299730526
Butter and cream?	18227.769584130605
Is Cissy your sweetheart?	10636.169657666971
— Nao, tearful Tommy said.	2950.8928477762697
Cissy queried.	9838.120154025048
— Nao, Tommy said.	2054.7258853362173
— I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes.	6548.538238008959
I know who is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	5901.570117191033
Gerty is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	10239.104276316439
— Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.	6809.718173224355
Cissy ’ s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn ’ t see and to mind he didn ’ t wet his new tan shoes.	11501.877348598167
But who was Gerty?	8306.216450465592
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see.	13393.003999718001
She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.	12346.126392488766
Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch ’ s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling.	14221.551985715756
The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid ’ s bow, Greekly perfect.	12895.769862581565
Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.	13679.151920871402
Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she ’ d never speak to her again.	13166.196491015497
No. Honour where honour is due.	7391.285651665957
There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.	12588.925522883324
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.	13763.969645552814
Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist.	15536.27791659717
Why have women such eyes of witchery?	11422.305694402943
Gerty ’ s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows.	13614.706575265116
Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive.	13997.57259250769
It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.	11782.745475114543
Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?	13664.647684977534
That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one.	7915.939990150233
But Gerty ’ s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.	9461.222624693994
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it.	5162.807695970312
She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.	11451.559309607432
And just now at Edy ’ s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God ’ s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.	13413.350559832028
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.	10125.451735561113
She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.	9411.961883991826
Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.	14333.11812570253
She knew right well, no - one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers ’ quarrel.	11773.426885186433
As per usual somebody ’ s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window.	10753.296785101262
Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W.	12273.292431633447
E.	1948.1085920489277
Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.	16078.422033301198
Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core.	15174.577716305339
Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time.	11022.233841243544
They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph.	12437.11337683601
But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn ’ t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.	11680.824922416368
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out.	11636.984959353566
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the _Lady ’ s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection.	14440.01304925628
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.	13098.215941765919
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery ’ s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.	13803.21639458125
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.	13181.384085536227
Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep.	14171.542084854542
Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops.	14599.814190730718
As for undies they were Gerty ’ s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her?	12965.466375200527
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn ’ t trust those washerwomen as far as she ’ d see them scorching the things.	12373.054445280462
She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers ’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn ’ t of a Friday.	13032.627660642062
And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time.	8428.19338698127
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror.	12081.741565255486
You are lovely, Gerty, it said.	4935.766952990694
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.	9181.743414403525
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.	10629.598999598922
C.	957.8630399978279
D.	2024.9303961274736
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be.	12877.994137363947
He was too young to understand.	5166.131158046705
He would not believe in love, a woman ’ s birthright.	6857.911371943938
The night of the party long ago in Stoer ’ s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.	11302.926212210621
He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments.	12101.763798152946
Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie ’ s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.	14751.520079724613
But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over.	10015.123688446589
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss.	14117.572522237257
It would be like heaven.	5403.046938315856
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve.	11835.80069198972
With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.	13709.31676034796
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be.	11408.353600250144
Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November.	12540.440545404743
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess.	13048.383482163861
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann ’ s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn ’ t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn ’ t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap ’ s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery ’ s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.	14004.410597455435
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.	14571.943322148487
But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there ’ d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please.	11017.333634919232
The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.	8480.310442201982
Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.	10216.312210966471
— You ’ re not my sister, naughty Tommy said.	3161.0254575220124
It ’ s my ball.	2114.827139852135
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.	12868.324529955828
— Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.	8784.84049731626
And she tickled tiny tot ’ s two cheeks to make him forget and played here ’ s the lord mayor, here ’ s his two horses, here ’ s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin.	10080.202232586687
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.	10765.622703960464
— I ’ d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won ’ t say.	4055.2359816453168
— On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.	8483.364908033664
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she ’ d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.	10943.747475949478
But not a pin cared Ciss.	9046.769637323045
— Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose.	8748.722159636327
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I ’ d look at him.	6844.309251282095
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls.	17574.764375895244
You had to laugh at her sometimes.	6879.344959290686
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men ’ s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White.	13404.017571164444
That was just like Cissycums.	5853.902563876175
O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father ’ s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.	11439.526601320467
There was none to come up to her for fun.	8188.527041811864
But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.	12351.80684745397
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ.	10363.335474715344
It was the men ’ s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.	6426.153725448632
J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament.	8666.320980597313
They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins.	13591.361257823113
How sad to poor Gerty ’ s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson ’ s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none.	14549.33974075241
Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.	13758.772614302763
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days.	12203.366669430945
Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.	13026.646718597836
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful.	12387.818040803688
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.	13048.080071854705
You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.	11875.712817678943
Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby ’ s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.	14509.760189681512
Her mother ’ s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.	13905.700803727364
No - one would have thought the end was so near.	7937.106946455679
Now he was laid to rest.	8078.219009462943
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn ’ t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby ’ s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.	10997.34340753025
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold.	11186.950005474835
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn ’ t like her mother ’ s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.	10922.455591828857
Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways.	13693.720806917738
You could see there was a story behind it.	5214.565742253105
She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.	11824.628513502055
She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker ’ s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.	14344.776073785128
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks.	12633.637998445605
Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball.	15517.595731904976
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please.	12649.159470081737
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn ’ t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.	12114.670328877935
— If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.	4578.953067581895
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.	13241.851363378375
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.	10037.696952589666
Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.	14314.576793195969
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.	10722.24226932824
And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin ’ s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.	13479.254071417676
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.	11466.970399591295
Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.	11916.379329385461
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn ’ t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.	13661.009133354839
— Say papa, baby.	5366.248418129563
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.	6989.930858621861
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.	10388.882667627855
— Haja ja ja haja.	6753.184526697845
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him.	12889.019854124563
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.	10498.27545998485
It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.	12910.464857024846
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins.	12283.508839046292
She gazed out towards the distant sea.	6982.590507547578
And while she gazed her heart went pitapat.	9819.223055185412
Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look.	6232.695625326877
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul.	10665.824164511934
Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them?	13000.6033618975
People were so queer.	13957.431763093164
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn ’ t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting.	12563.663316551496
He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.	7108.360558222011
She would have given worlds to know what it was.	5839.9619960409
He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down.	10617.95585072267
She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away.	9790.412610640806
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.	11915.55849272553
It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no - one else.	9163.768018101544
If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not.	11245.202243222904
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her.	10212.310044781645
There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm.	10661.16649863205
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn ’ t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past.	11354.038615327536
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.	11546.522977006473
Refuge of sinners.	18227.54902377354
Comfortress of the afflicted.	18069.93024529336
_Ora pro nobis_.	16807.970545269076
Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart.	14166.960891306991
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin ’ s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O ’ Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down.	12708.73677960854
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic.	13627.23702886046
He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature ’ s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word.	10010.301039246377
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours ’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.	12779.086815189827
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.	10004.310136080134
Little monkeys common as ditchwater.	13566.729940062689
Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them.	11340.49611649996
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.	11641.319776731816
— Jacky! Tommy! Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she ’ d ever bring them out.	9857.987161964324
She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn ’ t get it to grow long because it wasn ’ t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it.	11796.759280176984
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn ’ t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible.	10661.863341501134
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble.	13113.10195333104
_Tableau! _ That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness.	12273.194426437938
Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O ’ Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn ’ t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O ’ Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.	12566.202998168365
Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow ’ s of George ’ s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn ’ t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.	11976.536903820237
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature.	14006.315507390487
Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl ’ s shoulders — a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.	14633.362433250453
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.	8587.086570976546
She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve.	11922.41979928684
She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.	10314.138371498851
He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey.	7499.423790841493
Her woman ’ s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.	12170.427023076256
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.	13637.084576346655
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no - one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers.	13031.260787983325
And she said to Gerty: — A penny for your thoughts.	8268.74603639324
— What?	425.82801927876443
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.	13868.12500847909
I was only wondering was it late.	5506.980654755975
Because she wished to goodness they ’ d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late.	12505.834787511272
And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again.	10985.56801932847
But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.	9746.554856144512
— Wait, said Cissy, I ’ ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what ’ s the time by his conundrum.	7297.541345917467
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church.	11699.179437042774
Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself.	11155.80607137379
One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.	12147.386100317637
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set.	12842.618564950671
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.	12567.242054596552
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.	13546.231104322143
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O ’ Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.	11291.126490065571
It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets.	9090.061928821888
She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon.	10339.1018562199
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.	12886.703511547657
If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man ’ s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man ’ s face.	7674.7372841059105
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.	5670.490224546168
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins ’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O ’ Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.	12847.806062308746
Gerty winced sharply.	11089.997094238553
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable.	12110.948094243266
It hurt — O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.	11987.626899713408
Gerty ’ s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.	13933.645241746095
She had loved him better than he knew.	6508.076454263194
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.	12987.331521210346
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.	11979.697691812986
— O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up.	6075.378730288043
I can throw my cap at who I like because it ’ s leap year.	7691.918187587876
Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.	14201.23625916908
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.	9451.805098890212
As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces.	12937.435373072207
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.	11582.372451084262
Miss puny little Edy ’ s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.	13425.49031110479
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior.	13099.825115512354
And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.	13726.70851166727
— O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss.	6339.921886127746
He has his bib destroyed.	5401.443870038947
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.	12078.386339546354
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O ’ Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.	12800.50872791339
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry.	12164.505644643494
And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.	13936.083199207736
For Gerty had her dreams that no - one knew of.	8762.612362643285
She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean.	12983.759133417501
It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely ’ s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs.	13931.057799779115
_Art thou real, my ideal? _ it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou ever? _ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.	14006.1422224703
But it must end, she felt.	8646.922939526341
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her.	8674.003118532744
Love laughs at locksmiths.	11852.99849689722
She would make the great sacrifice.	8113.166697793214
Her every effort would be to share his thoughts.	10292.590307290166
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness.	15037.45401982239
There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.	12522.24671031748
But even if — what then?	6948.443941978049
Would it make a very great difference?	11500.546979710143
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled.	11569.68235330109
No, no: not that.	3014.554636369521
They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.	12709.047459414784
Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.	11430.734734416419
She thought she understood.	7182.750816192972
She would try to understand him because men were so different.	10113.324120660562
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.	10260.30913921985
Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide.	13419.956299424965
Nothing else mattered.	12536.44797527997
Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.	11833.897251241218
Canon O ’ Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn ’ t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out: — O, look, Cissy! And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.	12802.696711401963
— It ’ s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.	2322.2828616114793
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn ’ t fall running.	11035.806151984552
— Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.	4219.910723466846
It ’ s the bazaar fireworks.	2290.7887321989288
But Gerty was adamant.	7762.040691165156
She had no intention of being at their beck and call.	8667.18878045498
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was.	10184.284133992876
The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling.	9739.380944208346
She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.	8854.060424034835
Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.	14046.534250185154
At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips.	13964.695500344838
His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her.	8374.166734095
She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no - one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she ’ d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed.	12793.274584728524
But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips.	11693.438128379928
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn ’ t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors ’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.	12383.777116269923
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.	10247.14577791261
And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no - one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn ’ t ashamed and he wasn ’ t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn ’ t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.	12615.119782738933
She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl ’ s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages.	12907.382979647446
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft! Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.	13578.177261362443
Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.	13230.052857404624
He was leaning back against the rock behind.	5881.821060725377
Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.	12267.407960578776
What a brute he had been! At it again?	8124.234769432321
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?	10079.132965926072
An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered.	13673.758237055956
Should a girl tell?	15667.240073688406
No, a thousand times no.	5372.772990447853
That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don ’ t tell.	10579.839958518956
Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried: — Gerty! Gerty! We ’ re going.	13089.739788017509
Come on.	2128.6281357408134
We can see from farther up.	6447.783996962571
Gerty had an idea, one of love ’ s little ruses.	11158.208433894264
She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back.	11547.721379861521
Wonder if he ’ s too far to.	4927.7057353655455
She rose.	3128.2585430852255
Was it goodbye?	8830.708987777394
No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve.	11385.514690855009
She drew herself up to her full height.	9417.558644044278
Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face.	13288.638610997152
She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.	12761.424463901103
Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman.	15112.543865213958
It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed.	10431.311367795586
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because — because Gerty MacDowell was...	8563.58454151603
Tight boots?	13656.980144780464
No. She ’ s lame! O! Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away.	6830.946181383872
Poor girl! That ’ s why she ’ s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint.	8599.253235362761
Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib.	13697.315571673984
Jilted beauty.	13656.980144780438
A defect is ten times worse in a woman.	7323.020302525403
But makes them polite.	7762.079824117645
Glad I didn ’ t know it when she was on show.	5816.412391771352
Hot little devil all the same.	6979.880463532171
I wouldn ’ t mind.	2336.935680524109
Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses.	14356.347835665421
That squinty one is delicate.	9215.145824329291
Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish.	13586.864443966004
I have such a bad headache today.	3938.607334836583
Where did I put the letter?	6826.846618671275
Yes, all right.	2129.101838098619
All kinds of crazy longings.	8653.79054201613
Licking pennies.	15707.401234162855
Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil.	13613.205773725776
Virgins go mad in the end I suppose.	10860.990130129094
How many women in Dublin have it today?	8795.224042277832
Martha, she.	7190.83205709568
Something in the air.	3360.519064906794
That ’ s the moon.	1160.7714874772637
But then why don ’ t all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean?	6939.476974169189
Depends on the time they were born I suppose.	11800.607040054078
Or all start scratch then get out of step.	10367.264804857783
Sometimes Molly and Milly together.	12584.80631570916
Anyhow I got the best of that.	7464.087938593523
Damned glad I didn ’ t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter.	8745.557446053133
Made up for that tramdriver this morning.	9482.76124210864
That gouger M ’ Coy stopping me to say nothing.	6463.6964578493025
And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe.	10571.409182875352
Thankful for small mercies.	17932.61452774436
Yours for the asking.	15690.522030156602
Because they want it themselves.	8579.842296260977
Their natural craving.	10832.462322740925
Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.	16672.29715621295
Reserve better.	11288.406558228835
Don ’ t want it they throw it at you.	4494.55266681723
Catch em alive, O.	8484.653644998098
Pity they can ’ t see themselves.	5353.717506292488
A dream of wellfilled hose.	7661.239732455628
Where was that?	2770.7988166395194
Ah, yes.	1746.0403878931775

Put them all on to take them all off.	10856.479471514634
Molly.	4150.359356161469
Why I bought her the violet garters.	10110.2231497906
Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers.	15033.73010285113
He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met.	8224.060266468314
His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what?	8703.533850619247

Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out.	11498.065673027173
Pinned together.	11022.610779962071
O, Mairy lost the pin of her.	3212.799860885132
Dressed up to the nines for somebody.	13618.01814043156
Fashion part of their charm.	16732.55596111374
Just changes when you ’ re on the track of the secret.	8632.423492686237
Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then.	11891.051041935754
No reasonable offer refused.	8000.080831810944
She wasn ’ t in a hurry either.	6451.653453041515
Always off to a fellow when they are.	8758.84564804666
They never forget an appointment.	8316.42921302418
Out on spec probably.	8472.359856697163
They believe in chance because like themselves.	7912.1577390665125
And the others inclined to give her an odd dig.	8597.515636824422
Girl friends at school, arms round each other ’ s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden.	13908.753022138919
Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can ’ t get.	11453.608737049917

Sister souls.	10377.374781666476
Showing their teeth at one another.	10244.184045522401
How many have you left?	7409.565438895033
Wouldn ’ t lend each other a pinch of salt.	9698.492781085515
Ah! Devils they are when that ’ s coming on them.	6854.630983269675
Dark devilish appearance.	12182.443747252084
Scratch the sole of my foot.	13354.136019806143
O that way! O, that ’ s exquisite! Feel it myself too.	6033.973899510996
Good to rest once in a way.	5626.069115084976
Wonder if it ’ s bad to go with them then.	6496.804026348897
Safe in one way.	7799.3835868709975
Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap.	17571.179812434544
Something about withering plants I read in a garden.	10266.398540102648
Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she ’ s a flirt.	10182.616713559122
Daresay she felt I.	8712.101306046894
When you feel like that you often meet what you feel.	9754.791786460088
Liked me or what?	10714.452552973904
Dress they look at.	15979.203181066903

Trousers?	15443.024084639697
Suppose I when I was?	7251.392756205604
No. Gently does it.	2654.5488931579234
Dislike rough and tumble.	13447.338270564964
Kiss in the dark and never tell.	10064.388426294734
Saw something in me.	7379.310040972537
Wonder what.	5992.829505125563
Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic.	16215.02757347491
To aid gentleman in literary.	7532.909423088585
Ought to attend to my appearance my age.	11470.775413554176
Didn ’ t let her see me in profile.	8865.07136681465
Still, you never know.	5002.915825840097
Pretty girls and ugly men marrying.	16112.538316513788
Beauty and the beast.	8681.13775479879
Besides I can ’ t be so if Molly.	6812.637467381525
Wide brim.	18679.07077551165

Hair strong in rut.	13713.993513450303
Ten bob I got for Molly ’ s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street.	8766.818372564627
Why not?	2388.4504639375664
Suppose he gave her money.	8199.515137283877
Why not?	2388.4504639375664
All a prejudice.	6839.36135022798
She ’ s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound.	7275.719569256226
What?	572.8670519115202
I think so.	2497.7146812741207
All that for nothing.	4164.2726199109675
Bold hand: Mrs Marion.	9847.444849796339
Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn?	13564.246427521184
And the day I went to Drimmie ’ s without a necktie.	7488.16650529417
Wrangle with Molly it was put me off.	12602.748045713639
No, I remember.	2410.8270266133536

O Lord, that little limping devil.	8988.608576710907
Begins to feel cold and clammy.	16702.682729766926
Aftereffect not pleasant.	18227.54902377354
Still you have to get rid of it someway.	8983.478586402236
They don ’ t care.	2845.681372336339
Complimented perhaps.	10145.02317187903
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies.	14543.992567981042
Well, aren ’ t they?	5266.117753377175
See her as she is spoil all.	6896.156836755568

Still, I feel.	4068.515306263993
The strength it gives a man.	4667.756159186858
That ’ s the secret of it.	1216.3006639838106
Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam ’ s.	6929.912223803009
Cider that was.	7003.48901501915

Makes you want to sing after.	10312.49267597684
_Lacaus esant taratara_.	18227.54902377354
Suppose I spoke to her.	4895.567918653193
What about?	2838.8691069725846
Bad plan however if you don ’ t know how to end the conversation.	7499.80976730117
Ask them a question they ask you another.	12633.129983114826
Good idea if you ’ re stuck.	6389.793218307667
Gain time.	7629.79017046616
But then you ’ re in a cart.	4576.01476327151
O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was.	10978.876978037968
Whew! Girl in Meath street that night.	11097.414424536255
All the dirty things I made her say.	6861.357602327406
All wrong of course.	4772.680861521114
My arks she called it.	4633.610129510576
It ’ s so hard to find one who.	4867.414798569975
Aho! If you don ’ t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden.	12124.080847548721
And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.	8635.037403673154
Parrots.	19456.598729469286
O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That ’ s what they enjoy.	7844.765859008275
Taking a man from another woman.	11641.969915921109
Or even hear of it.	3459.7523280568785
Different with me.	5928.754308395362
Glad to get away from other chap ’ s wife.	10062.256360801608

French letter still in my pocketbook.	15880.772870301966
But might happen sometime, I don ’ t think.	3969.798874242654
Come in, all is prepared.	9445.334125897378
I dreamt.	3966.4837786130074
What?	572.8670519115202
Worst is beginning.	15868.195079096857
How they change the venue when it ’ s not what they like.	7125.344651533045
Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who.	14536.295320475258
Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.	10352.798983215614
Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.	8555.386054464156
Because I did.	5099.014100346681
She too.	2093.414498418833
Offend her.	7257.887496615099
Then make it up.	3142.367975249407
Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake.	14937.801960591367
Flatters them.	7138.9207488041475
She must have been thinking of someone else all the time.	5371.538213394445
What harm?	4465.559862111875
Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he.	8448.260053284206
First kiss does the trick.	8712.530892676861
The propitious moment.	3284.3591225593095
Something inside them goes pop.	11801.582919903105
First thoughts are best.	9545.347669010507
Remember that till their dying day.	8728.960388719837
Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens.	11768.553897452677
But her breasts were developed.	8646.975272954956
Fell asleep then.	9484.060966332021
After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home.	10390.45409726715
Featherbed mountain.	15707.401234162855
Gnashing her teeth in sleep.	12950.575143517113
Val Dillon.	15251.85879325401
Apoplectic.	19456.598729469286
There she is with them down there for the fireworks.	9508.481208400128
My fireworks.	6415.911826680588
Up like a rocket, down like a stick.	12258.413672753739
And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen.	8825.326278316974
Want to be grownups.	7595.230092696595
Dressing in mother ’ s clothes.	10542.673029458452
Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.	5956.896475404279
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth.	7557.232896180289
I knew she could whistle.	6157.993792716702
Mouth made for that.	6020.013256036972
Like Molly.	5457.160076866413
Would you mind, please, telling me the right time?	10282.030652905554
I ’ ll tell you the right time up a dark lane.	3977.836068385618
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips.	12619.789170483877
Caressing the little boy too.	10071.137352688645
Onlookers see most of the game.	12496.223465534431
Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.	10934.928463701159
In their line.	4751.266343040271
Didn ’ t look back when she was going down the strand.	9034.234453746918
Wouldn ’ t give that satisfaction.	6886.731103093724
Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.	7282.024076930778
Fine eyes she had, clear.	13780.773898743322
It ’ s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil.	6094.204281866667
Did she know what I?	6533.0607302940025
Course.	11023.48125806745
Like a cat sitting beyond a dog ’ s jump.	11058.053197460726
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show.	11293.12444583951
Call that innocence?	12962.219829989945
Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.	9391.761681804312
Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_.	12351.788857715346
Eyes all over them.	7497.357475856231
Look under the bed for what ’ s not there.	6382.697708337998
Longing to get the fright of their lives.	11900.939901185842
Sharp as needles they are.	10325.366927593523
When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm.	11469.743598934405
Had, too.	5068.624475725698
Where do they get that?	5532.145205413124
Typist going up Roger Greene ’ s stairs two at a time to show her understandings.	14759.898311228137
Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.	11690.424739600601
Bred in the bone.	12298.189610499528
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing.	14163.112634839505
Best place for an ad to catch a woman ’ s eye on a mirror.	9712.819134196201
And when I sent her for Molly ’ s Paisley shawl to Prescott ’ s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx.	11773.633489482183
I never told her.	2781.4998159116576
Attract men, small thing like that.	7009.595187145124
Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red.	13308.084260733525
Who did you learn that from?	9981.383130247943
Nobody.	10295.660825818126
Something the nurse taught me.	6833.94154265259
O, don ’ t they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly ’ s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west.	6875.939054531689
Me have a nice pace.	12588.556876657514
Mullingar.	8498.96645492669
Who knows?	4506.003864131902
Ways of the world.	4629.66868078646
Young student.	5850.046673331947
Straight on her pins anyway not like the other.	11178.621296195455
Still she was game.	8150.059503306582
Lord, I am wet.	7728.573195722483
Devil you are.	6707.189456864462
Swell of her calf.	14944.209270808686
Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.	15446.744673259002
Not like that frump today.	6462.679700829433
A.	567.5270913964941
E.	1948.1085920489277
Rumpled stockings.	11589.08186638269
Or the one in Grafton street.	5461.7243228439265
White.	10708.134690345654
Wow! Beef to the heel.	15124.582764459954
Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads.	15948.149262976727
And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks.	10726.951978458217
Will she?	5857.719102312968
Watch! Watch! See! Looked round.	11014.478800875537
She smelt an onion.	7535.266143049414
Darling, I saw, your.	14061.22842169699
I saw all.	2169.023128114726
Lord! Did me good all the same.	7332.097048681406
Off colour after Kiernan ’ s, Dignam ’ s.	4805.216404326722
For this relief much thanks.	6321.07041398774
In _Hamlet, _ that is.	4136.616180131396
Lord! It was all things combined.	11723.749859074012
Excitement.	19456.598729469286
When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue.	11131.415480723359
Your head it simply swirls.	6376.243984457645
He ’ s right.	748.4315984945744
Might have made a worse fool of myself however.	10883.032992382987
Instead of talking about nothing.	12852.430729741103
Then I will tell you all.	3492.826066115545
Still it was a kind of language between us.	5849.543836224357
It couldn ’ t be?	3632.4200735485224
No, Gerty they called her.	4368.82143111576
Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin ’ s barn a blind.	11384.294726190192
Her maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.	13591.320085402023
Place made me think of that I suppose.	10938.065525477183
All tarred with the same brush.	9886.289266541955
Wiping pens in their stockings.	15155.985519275808
But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood.	8218.246601203191
Every bullet has its billet.	13292.316083604339
Course I never could throw anything straight at school.	12251.853512784528
Crooked as a ram ’ s horn.	15579.328486662278
Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa ’ s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller ’ s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah.	15082.720961975307
No soft job.	5244.250922822257
Saves them.	7138.9207488041475
Nature.	13490.99621301991
Washing child, washing corpse.	14675.843478662306
Dignam.	4031.34645021227
Children ’ s hands always round them.	9471.100003103382
Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.	16059.354156560172
Oughtn ’ t to have given that child an empty teat to suck.	15891.705956810069
Fill it up with wind.	11733.8476053664
Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy.	9940.45139099835
Must call to the hospital.	8631.473745986947
Wonder is nurse Callan there still.	7803.814183541037
She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace.	9644.292455770381
That young doctor O ’ Hare I noticed her brushing his coat.	10014.238307804502
And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable.	11734.033094794944
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms.	11278.820517323897
Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.	13465.308178187903
Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.	10369.305404749211
Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night?	8933.256201833141
Chickens come home to roost.	17725.945664795767
They stick by one another like glue.	9562.48114500831
Maybe the women ’ s fault also.	10832.951666638164
That ’ s where Molly can knock spots off them.	4314.000963503357
It ’ s the blood of the south.	2330.4221468315363
Moorish.	16997.24734865402
Also the form, the figure.	9853.6628736004
Hands felt for the opulent.	10132.336544237854
Just compare for instance those others.	9895.441103167872
Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard.	14384.191666152748
Allow me to introduce my.	16057.92817651257
Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn ’ t know what to call her.	5913.164695672359
Always see a fellow ’ s weak point in his wife.	9915.106358496629
Still there ’ s destiny in it, falling in love.	8636.713324243514
Have their own secrets between them.	7017.850711324329
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn ’ t take them in hand.	10403.439568279951
Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies.	12608.069286064076
As God made them he matched them.	7457.497871167463
Twice nought makes one.	9941.202094079066
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride.	12648.463144706744
Marry in May and repent in December.	16682.90235283324
This wet is very unpleasant.	10393.855511890619
Stuck.	15443.024084639697
Well the foreskin is not back.	7331.209000364215
Better detach.	9134.90617610027
Ow! Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket.	14944.751587563334
Long and the short of it.	5337.881559824852
Very strange about my watch.	11362.214950784752
Wristwatches are always going wrong.	16727.71537890388
Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he.	10421.316034547706
Yes, I suppose, at once.	3374.0710283317594
Cat ’ s away, the mice will play.	15463.26810280067
I remember looking in Pill lane.	5788.673193950736
Also that now is magnetism.	11555.164463794907
Back of everything magnetism.	13713.993513450303
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.	16668.103238386047
That causes movement.	6350.2465285410935
And time, well that ’ s the time the movement takes.	6543.21998053336
Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.	11176.680328549623
Because it ’ s all arranged.	4897.136691391892
Magnetic needle tells you what ’ s going on in the sun, the stars.	7802.0855571817265
Little piece of steel iron.	12804.273409682935
When you hold out the fork.	9365.193407933804
Come.	2315.859250724524
Come.	2315.859250724524
Woman and man that is.	6113.135347546067
Fork and steel.	14632.365267766996
Molly, he.	4504.280194025505
Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you ’ re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you.	11250.783762307361
Tip.	12971.327416137423
Have to let fly.	8177.811441252036
Wonder how is she feeling in that region.	11394.49030272319
Shame all put on before third person.	14059.964366645976
More put out about a hole in her stocking.	11654.110890738008
Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show.	12841.920794018053
And when the painters were in Lombard street west.	4797.991292706175
Fine voice that fellow had.	10593.619791604535
How Giuglini began.	6695.498454839172
Smell that I did.	9346.67286510291
Like flowers.	6645.932775878456
It was too.	1598.7680878577285
Violets.	19456.598729469286
Came from the turpentine probably in the paint.	16273.349230616
Make their own use of everything.	12752.994966322472
Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn ’ t hear.	7888.656988822963
But lots of them can ’ t kick the beam, I think.	6713.205185032404
Keep that thing up for hours.	11639.376359805186
Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.	11049.23404788358
Wait.	1316.9653973396455
Hm. Hm. Yes.	7075.904684898304
That ’ s her perfume.	2863.5676746275644
Why she waved her hand.	5219.981266118027
I leave you this to think of me when I ’ m far away on the pillow.	7588.822247713247
What is it?	768.6383175649803
Heliotrope?	19456.598729469286
No. Hyacinth?	4210.490866107633
Hm. Roses, I think.	5799.412250661339
She ’ d like scent of that kind.	6195.884657826901
Sweet and cheap: soon sour.	15024.179911080193
Why Molly likes opoponax.	9495.175603444217
Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed.	11679.397451768551
Her high notes and her low notes.	9874.719131678896
At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours.	9754.351324432588
Heat brought it out.	7878.950482152053
She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before.	9294.447533786517
Good conductor, is it?	3561.2676271962328
Or bad?	7919.7548350386605
Light too.	4768.4044423942105
Suppose there ’ s some connection.	9319.226215218163
Mysterious thing too.	7616.422284436083
Why did I smell it only now?	6546.881111828204
Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure.	15287.538563614715
Suppose it ’ s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across.	10464.452026294783
Yes, it is.	1089.3347049765061
Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off.	10934.330447450124
Tell you what it is.	4206.574867692853
It ’ s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they ’ re always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it.	8504.361766399867
Clings to everything she takes off.	12378.451298395594
Warm shoe.	15707.401234162882
Stays.	19456.598729469286
Drawers: little kick, taking them off.	12237.60530142949
Byby till next time.	8220.810925411153
Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed.	8849.45135746364
Know her smell in a thousand.	12391.686026600812
Bathwater too.	6944.695736638013
Reminds me of strawberries and cream.	12984.39256498927
There or the armpits or under the neck.	9464.873241728894
Because you get it out of all holes and corners.	8691.68677572897
Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.	13103.200069922023
Muskrat.	19456.598729469286
Bag under their tails.	14932.939293016801
One grain pour off odour for years.	9652.114990266558
Dogs at each other behind.	10067.61934371563
Good evening.	6958.651763431728
Evening.	14336.178182593083
How do you sniff?	5151.879220473757
Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you.	8039.284552005569
Yes now, look at it that way.	5944.302348946714
We ’ re the same.	2986.4223302027895
Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period.	14306.933653436803
Come near.	6713.952924851747
Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.	9143.400493337778
Like what?	4589.2879556118505
Potted herrings gone stale or.	14675.272723149948
Boof! Please keep off the grass.	16685.536349520324
Perhaps they get a man smell off us.	10725.478989850477
What though?	5310.3952380902765
Cigary gloves long John had on his desk the other day.	12149.82616137463
Breath?	19456.598729469286
What you eat and drink gives that.	5812.245369083678

All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles.	9603.295788686317
Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands.	8877.874364227606
Weeny bones.	13657.083414684854

Birds too.	5523.03854338852
Never find out.	4747.691666612088
Or what they say.	4105.6426996056025
Like our small talk.	9004.13244624653
Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back.	11291.490047850268

_Faugh a ballagh! _ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow.	14386.698396811315
Married too.	5523.03854338852
Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere.	9806.901290548201
No ends really because it ’ s round.	6313.174414860164
Wife in every port they say.	7510.178960007091
She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again.	9051.02181022452
If ever he does.	5798.866166854353
Smelling the tail end of ports.	17572.375269864162

And the tephilim no what ’ s this they call it poor papa ’ s father had on his door to touch.	8230.714017474198
That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage.	5460.473087878991
Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers.	13662.206510329734
Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that ’ s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him.	10547.66014409386
Do fish ever get seasick?	11071.386203001699

The shepherd ’ s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst.	10417.456657399038
From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o ’ clock postman, the glowworm ’ s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges.	13426.241734213403
And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy ’ s terrace.	11833.31388868973
By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races! _ and from the door of Dignam ’ s house a boy ran out and called.	12258.992059969221
Twittering the bat flew here, flew there.	12036.432052617109
Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey.	12631.115322165546
Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns.	16233.090822932456
He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake.	11662.459352732276
And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.	9483.973583949499

Nausea.	19456.598729469286
And the women, fear of God in their faces.	6387.692613684615
Milly, no sign of funk.	13662.902940529402
Her blue scarf loose, laughing.	7327.295769346095
Don ’ t know what death is at that age.	5081.077525756305
And then their stomachs clean.	5219.226570898873
But being lost they fear.	7093.63411297759
When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin.	11418.710713732276
I didn ’ t want to.	1425.1044270856535
Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood.	13679.938632388317
Frightening them with masks too.	10070.571752852547
Throwing them up in the air to catch them.	7318.04492910937
I ’ ll murder you.	1271.8122220235339
Is it only half fun?	9138.0720508774
Or children playing battle.	10120.794185173527
Whole earnest.	14193.346567858442
How can people aim guns at each other.	7352.267034226405
Sometimes they go off.	10015.126814856516
Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash.	13075.934394760785
After getting better asleep with Molly.	9342.589756869796
Very same teeth she has.	10722.680201407766
What do they love?	4446.760886336222
Another themselves?	11935.765987958684
But the morning she chased her with the umbrella.	8522.413496756408
Perhaps so as not to hurt.	9338.569660402643
I felt her pulse.	6829.168961864708
Ticking.	19456.598729469286
Little hand it was: now big.	12963.86199015975
All that the hand says when you touch.	8407.096278141436
Loved to count my waistcoat buttons.	15669.61847382563
Her first stays I remember.	6624.911023143431
Made me laugh to see.	6682.3897832717275
Little paps to begin with.	10383.970982699202
Left one is more sensitive, I think.	8821.689908205224
Nearer the heart?	14633.250425498389
Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me.	8166.628917012806
Frightened she was when her nature came on her first.	12974.156464260966
Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too.	9329.269561263807
Brings back her girlhood.	15393.2044208097
Gibraltar.	15443.179799528376
Looking from Buena Vista.	12966.423775746363
O ’ Hara ’ s tower.	5290.794140072575
The seabirds screaming.	5442.1386306936365
Old Barbary ape that gobbled all his family.	10315.967667178704
Looking out over the sea she told me.	6476.2687397373
Evening like this, but clear, no clouds.	15328.53605508796
I always thought I ’ d marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a private yacht.	11341.211122906494
_Buenas noches, señorita.	15665.818686485021
El hombre ama la muchacha hermosa_.	16702.366946211594
Why me?	3790.8562094016347
Because you were so foreign from the others.	9557.554240032448
Better not stick here all night like a limpet.	12261.735625854666
This weather makes you dull.	10067.749185685629
Must be getting on for nine by the light.	7069.684949729977
Go home.	5631.9458052524
Too late for _Leah, Lily of <URL> No. Might be still up.	10766.447088845825
Call to the hospital to see.	6952.150535370848
Hope she ’ s over.	4743.659101108111
Long day I ’ ve had.	8559.57487010303
Martha, the bath, funeral, house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus ’ song.	14061.178176036312
Then that bawler in Barney Kiernan ’ s.	3910.826636357511
Got my own back there.	7324.753827966736
Drunken ranters what I said about his God made him wince.	17165.49796091854
Mistake to hit back.	9255.314902049038
Or?	6197.390787671949
No. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves.	8112.700657774732
Always want to be swilling in company.	10478.488904352364
Afraid to be alone like a child of two.	11712.010534618576
Suppose he hit me.	5526.388867874605
Look at it other way round.	8295.612375622253
Not so bad then.	4973.680920034694
Perhaps not to hurt he meant.	12345.500180845338
Three cheers for Israel.	8508.271345140982
Three cheers for the sister - in - law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth.	9173.900729498691
Same style of beauty.	7854.6833912689735
Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea.	11625.412410782405
The sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo has just come to town.	9416.547906323713
Imagine that in the early morning at close range.	14531.230766584422
Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow.	14776.584091558487
But Dignam ’ s put the boots on it.	5728.455150203997
Anyhow she wants the money.	9355.448193736107
Must call to those Scottish Widows as I promised.	11751.163088854324
Strange name.	7681.3939285506285
Takes it for granted we ’ re going to pop off first.	11351.315677897486
That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer ’ s that looked at me.	7532.787571146394
Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium.	17243.843135888128
Her widow ’ s mite.	9670.15452187712
Well?	3294.9718417722875
What do you expect her to do?	5064.205829468027
Must wheedle her way along.	9523.679943227173
Widower I hate to see.	7818.541672931511
Looks so forlorn.	12182.59111938178
Poor man O ’ Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here.	10000.795416545554
The sewage.	3466.618055653469
Some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him.	10201.287106224137
Take him in tow, platter face and a large apron.	13809.369839029447
Ladies ’ grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a pair, astonishing bargain.	15871.60885892596
Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say.	8991.47659330901
Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we die.	11553.596784770187
See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the trick.	9962.817622647244

Fate that is.	4931.900732662485
He, not me.	2655.12261362392
Also a shop often noticed.	12757.384615896777
Curse seems to dog it.	8189.831106198118
Dreamt last night?	12183.254352830483
Wait.	1316.9653973396455
Something confused.	9167.063308793122
She had red slippers on.	3803.2467519085053
Turkish.	12971.327416137423
Wore the breeches.	14632.45380817492
Suppose she does?	9538.397329269706
Would I like her in pyjamas?	13263.938141335067
Damned hard to answer.	11131.053907435005

She has something to put in them.	5311.744937654805
What ’ s that?	894.4338426605067
Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand.	7978.938545101641
He brought it near his eyes and peered.	8059.08689313593
Letter?	14336.178182593083
No. Can ’ t read.	4189.730465310154
Better go.	5350.55233737209
Better.	5721.0475848644
I ’ m tired to move.	2662.2796914765204
Page of an old copybook.	15155.530699884077
All those holes and pebbles.	6944.448090875907
Who could count them?	6814.246039723874
Never know what you find.	8090.99103510024
Bottle with story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck.	15654.745469058122

Bread cast on the waters.	12490.344935213769
What ’ s this?	1889.7350967348702
Bit of stick.	10225.926709344589
O! Exhausted that female has me.	6344.3820849691065
Not so young now.	4499.080087427368
Will she come here tomorrow?	11137.606637490433
Wait for her somewhere for ever.	8027.677583129228
Murderers do.	9746.617166046197
Will I?	4960.698044054687
Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot.	7725.827470569145
Write a message for her.	7015.93349516697
Might remain.	10037.653318628356
I.	442.8329584233336
Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning.	5671.065827568931
Useless.	13490.99621301991
Washed away.	9493.672059841358
Tide comes here.	8355.705381009984
Saw a pool near her foot.	12880.308264657759
Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs.	15744.6177799772
All these rocks with lines and scars and letters.	10280.884515195954
O, those transparent! Besides they don ’ t know.	4110.224653259129
What is the meaning of that other world.	3979.036884658319
I called you naughty boy because I do not like.	4926.11568856883
AM.	19456.598729469286

No room.	4503.535962819886
Let it go.	6434.337976465791
Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot.	7121.730901203564
Hopeless thing sand.	14632.365267766996
Nothing grows in it.	4046.3691361480746
All fades.	6523.269050754646
No fear of big vessels coming up here.	7540.286766990093

Round the Kish in eighty days.	10329.905962060646
Done half by design.	14932.638156629911
He flung his wooden pen away.	5266.004792440909
Now if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn ’ t.	8055.684686133983
Chance.	19456.598729469286
We ’ ll never meet again.	4330.3436178950815
But it was lovely.	4180.724528730091
Goodbye, dear.	7851.19618638636

Must be near nine.	4937.5651821617
Liverpool boat long gone.	11420.159941828968
Not even the smoke.	7637.53814750118
And she can do the other.	4187.923319104892
Did too.	3172.237447151105
And Belfast.	4975.7915955385515

Race there, race back to Ennis.	16162.794439999438
Let him.	2356.470422489628
Just close my eyes a moment.	6532.281595924971
Won ’ t sleep, though.	8228.349007659015
Half dream.	11022.360772724014
It never comes the same.	4446.577079713763
Bat again.	8198.124297545315
No harm in him.	4029.1696702086574

There.	2862.6261154811546
Here.	1968.8314675885797
Far in the grey a bell chimed.	13300.156222082085
Mr Bloom with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed.	9103.087120498003
The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest ’ s house cooed where Canon O ’ Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.	7041.448319252896

were taking tea and sodabread and butter and fried mutton chops with catsup and talking about Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	14660.960906193188
Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the rocks looking was Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	11345.643816219621

Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Universally that person ’ s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind ’ s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature ’ s incorrupted benefaction.	15315.48030573867
For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature ’ s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution ’ s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?	15450.932446375286
It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.	11733.206923747268
Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O ’ Shiels, the O ’ Hickeys, the O ’ Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux.	13591.192450011675
Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.	15973.010417866366
To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile.	15035.429450789657
O thing of prudent nation not merely in being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt! Before born bliss babe had.	14235.23096843245
Within womb won he worship.	15150.622186653598
Whatever in that one case done commodiously done was.	12688.489844130696
A couch by midwives attended with wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.	15016.817314079706
Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night ’ s oncoming.	13895.310970135148
Of Israel ’ s folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared.	13969.169952128714
Stark ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.	13788.83317315018
Of that house A.	6867.521974716364

Seventy beds keeps he there teeming mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale so God ’ s angel to Mary quoth.	15442.809850187134
Watchers tway there walk, white sisters in ward sleepless.	17216.81282107909
Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice an hundred.	17076.859997541582
Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest ward.	16637.948208670197
In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid.	13940.760020620899
Lo, levin leaping lightens in eyeblink Ireland ’ s westward welkin.	15453.93101185148
Full she drad that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.	14932.07354334179
Christ ’ s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch.	15002.170654804637
That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne ’ s house.	6076.514223351055
Loth to irk in Horne ’ s hall hat holding the seeker stood.	13230.323813835617
On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered.	14312.546404621915
Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed.	14725.47102124648
Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked.	13867.525000152906
Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.	15373.733098634986
As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared.	13426.720776599814
Glad after she was that ere adread was.	10759.475710254546
Her he asked if O ’ Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O ’ Hare Doctor in heaven was.	12529.160948781215
Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful.	13060.025011524322
All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God ’ s rightwiseness to withsay.	12172.801732824462
She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men ’ s oil to his limbs.	11163.453340688173
The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness.	13108.662910328714
He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring.	9816.986770763267
So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.	11306.310294219174
Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother ’ s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.	14276.690871173283
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.	11730.996886558774
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be.	11041.656097916833
She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman ’ s birth.	11579.669347078212
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house.	10638.2194125141
The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women ’ s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid.	12632.578567537123
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.	15316.311760780676
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat.	11322.24891900368
And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon.	10222.143514275822
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.	12713.82188422699
And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there.	8785.824665636032
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile.	7700.346559070043
Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.	14879.080115239123
But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle.	11442.4188922355
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.	10815.903312584162
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment.	12398.815564630775
And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously.	13959.468303305726
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles.	13308.12790186036
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer.	12017.701677224799
And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.	12398.790007057241
And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.	13671.564883425901
And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain.	13646.641921605638
And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.	11017.353928232951
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.	11664.790292683516
And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile.	14872.225935075283
And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile.	8372.706512643828
Thanked be Almighty God.	11852.580428062383
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.	13593.349013000274
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now.	12535.71426851506
Meseems it dureth overlong.	17932.61452774436
And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently.	11916.380725641531
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.	11518.289479119383
And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next.	9421.958485114272
Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both ’ s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness.	12539.350358498437
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars ’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup.	11622.408855246833
Woman ’ s woe with wonder pondering.	11763.203196939174
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might.	13852.374623848089
There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable ’ s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold.	13117.968031513721
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.	13632.65518206381
Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.	17015.584701655185
For they were right witty scholars.	10537.726307973675
And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne ’ s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case).	12581.627262656872
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die.	12640.474119883042
And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy.	13910.202624510315
A redress God grant.	7210.75792986819
This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die.	13469.20594884306
In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack.	15026.576143167065
Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved.	14345.202946207024
To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.	13588.83783546685
Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.	13897.18928445273
But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life?	12886.537110630414
For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.	6850.575998255022
We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.	11303.218170540915
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.	12459.706150036925
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.	13189.517436226246
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi ’ s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do.	14049.63009068443
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever.	15634.914838374998
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides.	14134.118903252638
He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God ’ s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman ’ s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded.	13504.268607449201
All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life.	12524.176471960578
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions.	13910.512156232873
That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word.	9923.494134620967
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.	12624.461574893025
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny.	14871.17901681824
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb ’ s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend ’ s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.	14462.227650710282
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.	15838.671329684961
Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul ’ s bodiment.	14880.470370066181
Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone.	14548.22936459077
Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay.	13799.370680565946
See ye here.	4978.401382335347
And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ.	8896.578248265925
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore.	11590.663512944915
His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time ’ s ruins build eternity ’ s mansions.	10369.570433589563
What means this?	4830.282763209511
Desire ’ s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time.	12562.032809510985
Mark me now.	5876.624655945709
In woman ’ s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.	11201.574614592262
This is the postcreation.	6430.983121575185
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	11816.888630436475
No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.	14645.338041365378
But here is the matter now.	5784.234657237447
Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, _parceque M.	13619.760903135913
Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l ’ avait mise dans cette fichue position c ’ était le sacré pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_ transubstantiality _oder_ consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality.	14941.424950067725
And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word.	7494.561358618094
A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.	9113.248929777033
Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship.	10989.388708800992
With will will we withstand, withsay.	11076.07710348036
Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo, _ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard.	15601.359396997637
It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time ’ s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred.	14898.812456726277
In Horne ’ s house rest should reign.	7433.250328613481
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar ’ s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.	13655.1314287645
Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.	13350.054684270057
But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin.	10213.562997700397
Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided.	15494.965390386084
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their _Maid ’ s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals.	14627.358131945186
An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.	15066.502283890693
Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come.	14012.480920337312
Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it.	12713.93453061686
Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.	9807.533850515796
Go thou and do likewise.	13057.263505350455
Thus, or words to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden.	14745.556133905848

Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum.	15652.839458190703
Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants.	13946.752073809495
Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian.	16622.644464790388
Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money.	12746.503802866293
But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever.	11897.403589502706
And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth.	10751.19849371811
This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell ’ s gates visited a darkness that was foraneous.	14738.360056572985

And as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being.	14305.00654443947
The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend.	13596.775977852345
First, saved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage.	15475.684064645699
And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.	14532.842779275628
Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.	15511.895486809282
Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack See the malt stored in many a refluent sack, In the proud cirque of Jackjohn ’ s bivouac.	16383.563769904658
A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back.	8143.6505435971
Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler.	16635.744070895165
Came now the storm that hist his heart.	11739.1075909561
And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry.	13423.31040437934
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm.	13807.325858264838
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour.	13925.482866727907
But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.	12100.047144588769
But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne ’ s hall.	9833.533397800391
He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart ’ s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.	13867.513903132622
But was young Boasthard ’ s fear vanquished by Calmer ’ s words?	11011.489314662556
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other?	10792.398767784487
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either.	6908.3671741949875
But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal?	13689.148152990092
Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle.	16274.10877788552
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon?	13745.51918773659
Heard?	14336.178182593083
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done).	9559.749532420437
For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.	8982.05787906664
And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away?	9899.763221569821
By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law.	14587.767781197492
Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe - on - Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it?	12232.44144602399
Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird - in - the - Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two - in - the - Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.	12031.751506865947
For regarding Believe - on - Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two - in - the - Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild.	14730.101383009202
So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer.	15000.885662873472
Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.	14217.16022576236
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.	9989.305463893952
Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won ’ t sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.	14050.124073135123
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without.	13994.826853101746
The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire.	12182.149568928427
All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.	13541.889175309225
But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came.	14744.464020555022
In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke ’ s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first.	13859.943185155287
Over against the Rt. Hon.	13842.099346855972
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon ’ s door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the college lands) Mal.	11903.492897157346
Mulligan a gentleman ’ s gentleman that had but come from Mr Moore ’ s the writer ’ s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite) chanced against Alec.	12909.2580423364
Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M ’ s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne ’ s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne ’ s.	13592.2522674575
There Leop.	6275.28844071612

Leop.	16997.075953601605
Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can ’ t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue.	14252.684347111137
’ Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick ’ s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king ’ s bible.	13840.769304810905
Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear.	13627.20114970222
In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi ’ s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer ’ s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.	14460.460441005893
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night ’ s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen ’ s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk.	12443.89843133355
He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat.	11109.481344058237
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook ’ s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother ’ s son of them would burst their sides.	12346.387558324832
The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale.	10866.4530294745
Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’ tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague.	13652.74512678485
But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.	9092.00937183892
There ’ s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.	11412.825717595866
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too.	14382.607898792945
One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire ’ s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids ’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge.	14628.737876842433
He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him.	11425.858254533525
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?	10096.403438231318
I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he.	7059.760288177097
I can scarce believe ’ tis so bad, says he.	4459.885988978089
And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low ’ s yard in Prussia street.	12684.426837967634
I question with you there, says he.	3657.5217982590675
More like ’ tis the hoose or the timber tongue.	12547.141681766738
Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor ’ s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns.	12000.228612036715
Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.	7441.0182559053255
Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop.	13230.568148128106
I conceive you, says Mr Dixon.	4845.331822812056
It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose.	10620.105032226404
True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock.	7995.03179376172
He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.	11603.550128081817
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself.	11262.906859316843
So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer ’ s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly.	11561.156690414238
But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.	12454.517164884315
Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart ’ s content.	13264.780442220042
By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.	13294.721535817524
To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls ’ language and they all after him.	12344.219010622312
Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground.	11548.250232926413
And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he ’ d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry ’ s orders.	12388.382976151757
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I ’ ll meddle in his matters, says he.	8545.772931867945
I ’ ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me.	5075.228247512592
But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show.	13008.260086488386
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow ’ s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name.	10696.202146256845
Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls ’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.	13908.216651298215
In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.	12611.253413973322
They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America.	13763.550674096843
Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: _ — Pope Peter ’ s but a pissabed.	11986.458819224341
A man ’ s a man for a ’ <URL> Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars.	12428.971661494857
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell ’ s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.	14385.018476200226
Fertiliser and Incubator.	18227.54902377354
Lambay Island_.	18679.07077551165
His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed.	14089.980437064158
Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon.	8408.429217308629
I make no doubt it smacks of wenching.	9725.489381804338
Come, be seated, both.	8659.544446103935
’ Tis as cheap sitting as standing.	11720.481518120985
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired.	14180.436304153018
It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep.	13673.524824654427
To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party.	14523.132543551124
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural.	14415.016814017266
Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains.	9435.968532013825
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.	11882.04587151836
For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies.	15209.521517557261
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it.	11772.000702725996
They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan ’ s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.	13094.898088582675
His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary ’ s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.	14186.457421339343
Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.	14479.045342219164
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced.	16410.775257955556
The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour.	10830.234348082766
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give?	12660.3748672407
Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne ’ s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman ’ s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.	12054.541051878834
Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.	14310.367330456762
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’ tis pity she ’ s a trollop): There ’ s a belly that never bore a bastard.	11411.61491949514
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.	13718.034560216192
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.	10600.983970740364
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.	13851.572164490237
That you may and very opportunely.	9913.19593985862
There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity.	12379.571354475913
But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things.	13395.390055432013
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.	14230.900770722228
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’ pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.	13958.32305499286
I declare, I was never so touched in all my life.	7060.697966380361
God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours.	12317.445462061527
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.	11383.305270477502
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years.	16061.312896573674
But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.	7815.765423652278
How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.	11673.88980853081
Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish.	16704.00857255081
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it.	9788.881793450924
Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.	11034.283683580876
But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.	13288.912460355856
Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak.	15210.645804326226
A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.	12400.834966164673
Pooh! A _livre! _ cries Monsieur Lynch.	15909.103449962013
The clumsy things are dear at a sou.	9485.336086094941
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.	13206.377927229665
No woman of any wit would wear one.	8140.689476531815
The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath...	10182.795687223372
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.	13737.849486154779
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company.	14226.37034977872
The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry.	13268.923111099337
Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.	16639.245950699602
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I ’ ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you.	6202.525306849501
What, you dog?	5884.590259439328
Have you a way with them?	6578.786549547358
Gad ’ s bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch.	14993.52142422933
Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I ’ m all of a wibbly wobbly.	13012.701174650354
Why, you ’ re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.	10595.318520543284
I knows a lady what ’ s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.	8006.531260360217
The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.	11022.252695293135
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.	14723.103661733725
I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.	11223.012736888597
I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast.	12342.681046956226
I cannot away with them.	3983.2067494896755
What?	572.8670519115202
Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours?	15291.440321840231
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay?	11808.953445670397
Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.	15043.567877667581
Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door.	11879.526343644455
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath.	13282.15729593544
Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.	14114.53985847539
To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.	13923.104583609067
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.	13943.730305695388
But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon ’ s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation ’ s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.	13626.29138589825
It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable.	13565.721633014788
To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat.	15132.331038246917
Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.	15107.864127238232
To conclude, while from the sister ’ s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.	12837.058385475046
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.	14678.686734988527
The dressy young blade said it was her husband ’ s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron.	10345.101306893666
I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her.	11832.330681576967
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.	11281.690015979899
’ Slife, I ’ ll be round with you.	4366.837299841677
I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her.	8537.091958531053
All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household.	13949.971005351026
Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest.	16031.814918672026
But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.	12096.989398288837
But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity?	14071.280075208899
Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled?	10703.231381589598
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents?	16025.763258322031
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?	13214.442198495937
Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?	13348.879336599119
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.	13838.28461870884
Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate.	16390.989363569082
He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy ’ s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe ’ s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic.	14961.782799642266
It ill becomes him to preach that gospel.	10130.273468152893
Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare?	13961.264414918789
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life.	9414.674816100644
If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him.	12910.01164310768
His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.	12861.915027374047
The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.	15040.866145146445
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born.	13639.333525859574
When he had betaken himself to the women ’ s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues.	14626.20379856161
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain.	11911.28296640782
The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent.	12684.91221634071
Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king ’ s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt, _ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents — in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations.	15321.41734246296
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.	14602.737698440353
The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human.	13713.606052633571
An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.	14880.16263640602
The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived.	10404.994665221
It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.	11937.97542220981
Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.	15273.576273105973
Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.	15552.205406736792
But Malachias ’ tale began to freeze them with horror.	10951.37646883521
He conjured up the scene before them.	5577.092587550543
The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared...	5701.030698767265
Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked <URL> Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.	13629.821471544128
I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame.	10082.212074703328
Yes, it is true.	2634.4638322870596
I am the murderer of Samuel Childs.	5159.624376073372
And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me.	8035.297861809333
This is the appearance is on me.	5098.134720488105
Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?	14439.844176134484
My hell, and Ireland ’ s, is in this life.	6505.981005117803
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.	7957.070794926697
Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out.	14420.482841634437
In vain! His spectre stalks me.	6188.579632002184
Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.	10910.951195310363
He was gone.	1796.7668998816143
Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host.	15147.618607461716
The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_.	12081.4068120894
The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.	8297.21018591453
Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.	15068.319135998794
The mystery was unveiled.	6549.046155587141
Haines was the third brother.	9518.712540305858
His real name was Childs.	7827.331375878693
The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.	6124.05654687621
He drank drugs to obliterate.	6156.316199832031
For this relief much thanks.	6321.07041398774
The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.	9491.678923889942
No soul will live there.	5573.415435482238
The spider pitches her web in the solitude.	9143.16352192317
The nocturnal rat peers from his hole.	8525.87020554198
A curse is on it.	3540.296396170505
It is haunted.	4121.613419850012
Murderer ’ s ground.	9439.50851698939
What is the age of the soul of man?	5612.6866459914445
As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood.	14356.462992326655
No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds.	13434.404885574451
A score of years are blown away.	6516.442257291272
He is young Leopold.	3440.0159292652934
There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.	10702.24959445436
That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother ’ s thought.	12996.581654795487
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart?	14244.008429840775
But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist.	13625.409914717036
Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons.	11971.66086149108
Who can say?	6298.520261781881
The wise father knows his own child.	7054.520228323194
He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first.	9754.584883656746
Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.	15303.165679996091
Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight.	16055.838097721742
They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat! _) light shall flood the world.	9711.48073638284
Did heart leap to heart?	10259.695360985012
Nay, fair reader.	11980.639219479259
In a breath ’ twas done but — hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk.	12971.550346780949
She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.	7571.180215758239
She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day.	8202.257083587248
No, Leopold.	2772.2936503533665
Name and memory solace thee not.	11722.037385731715
That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee — and in vain.	11286.543460368837
No son of thy loins is by thee.	9978.714205281718
There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.	11740.78753279817
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived.	13098.357789671265
A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.	12712.605952669237
She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal.	12413.913102423254
Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.	15587.872636873877
They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.	8889.750730609168
Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.	15719.04402025769
Netaim, the golden, is no more.	10695.753149277669
And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts.	12777.60532311304
Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions.	15914.775870899746
Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_.	16366.498689337239
Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.	14839.365122136207
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.	15375.01946718903
And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven ’ s own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo.	11461.0894357486
And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin.	10843.479310015728
It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.	10501.955489467411
How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer.	12182.965170833073
It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.	15039.5746097122
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee ’ s time.	12041.668748655145
He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus.	8677.530799275153
Where were they now?	6104.229429961067
Neither knew.	11484.279349821476
You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said.	3785.9276478794955
Why think of them?	6157.104921324392
If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call?	12234.672197630762
Who supposes it?	4389.870327647786
I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life.	9387.256719827634
He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.	11414.38399762066
That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father.	12793.307896320706
All who wish you well hope this for you.	6675.5951774933355
All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos.	12544.51504318296
I heartily wish you may not fail them.	6619.437219454281
O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him.	8359.16772177187
Have no fear.	7887.1354290033305
He could not leave his mother an orphan.	8521.630499733972
The young man ’ s face grew dark.	3599.1064620525954
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss.	10932.688158622395
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart.	10597.400867857625
Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider ’ s name: Lenehan as much more.	13128.294605231045
He told them of the race.	4426.291873974948
Madden up.	4611.188242053327
She was leading the field.	4619.180771552154
All hearts were beating.	8312.053337342382
Even Phyllis could not contain herself.	11812.009088019327
She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her.	12492.214824055094
All was lost now.	3886.389004759855
Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones.	15639.697427533898
Juno, she cried, I am undone.	12730.701301359903
A tear fell: one only.	7734.1705357102155
A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W.	8048.143008471847
Lane.	14848.463238075023
Four winners yesterday and three today.	10469.660643903111
What rider is like him?	6312.204267883824
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.	14071.49739525485
But let us bear it as was the ancient wont.	11719.764478845407
Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh.	11689.068380655888
She is not the filly that she was.	4912.469776153366
Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another.	11005.56275104953
By gad, sir, a queen of them.	5161.947023550709
Do you remember her, Vincent?	7150.321405179798
I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said.	7242.30534613569
How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it.	10896.68160309437
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.	11671.941360470722
In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge.	11977.540266713875
A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.	13449.185103835041
Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together.	11202.84309135107
And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field.	10076.79920566141
Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.	14159.9557176114
The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her.	11880.198609050762
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries.	13372.394475861225
But he had been kind.	4016.731032849901
In going by he had blessed us.	7492.180046410666
The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.	4225.170500154061
If I had poor luck with Bass ’ s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely.	11645.22523961876
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.	10817.996262808569
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.	14683.061279571823
His soul is far away.	5729.64700263215
It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born.	9437.987083256123
Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.	13620.938443142126
Do you not think it, Stephen?	6244.530037821161
Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.	13358.393537268268
The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.	13318.290992452701
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all.	12201.646126756135
The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop.	14044.192593694554
During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton - on - Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone ’ s remark on account of its scarlet appearance.	13178.440257767264
He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before ’ s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.	13045.17066185928
Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.	13095.280832213075
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life.	8436.597385577987
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.	16194.835653056976
The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital.	11736.913774318027
The high hall of Horne ’ s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic.	12128.443799431108
A gallant scene in truth it made.	9088.650352230654
Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.	12788.945958684035
There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom.	12973.728614925225
Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden.	15480.955197637397
The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer ’ s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.	14085.63096707024
Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.	14900.387679523978
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S.	10059.63029351607
Dedalus ’ (Div.	11955.799645283152
Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods.	15685.108863564386
The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can.	10164.3919171161
There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer — at present — such as the first problem submitted by Mr L.	11153.684877210228
Bloom (Pubb.	5894.772046022199
Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.	14570.206494356837
Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both?	14774.800986432096
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature ’ s favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_, of the passive element.	13077.825100355825
The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.	10662.318892222864
It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways.	9569.132916159797
Mr M.	2431.3680831135007
Mulligan (Hyg.	14188.216383417554
et Eug.	18679.07077551165
Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.	15562.432152716538
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust.	15208.151067088516
These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas — these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.	12824.368513317826
Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.	15139.407449999268
Mr J.	1629.410490443127
Crotthers (Disc.	16807.8688531982
Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide.	15559.027113869914
Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative.	16461.872857156257
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions.	13452.802318391145
An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V.	11450.80751822472
Lynch (Bacc.	12536.523824119988
Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature ’ s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.	14863.685699602984
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet ’ s words, give us pause.	12447.27529475909
Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.	15395.995897351382
Mr S.	1928.192768335085
Dedalus ’ (Div.	11955.799645283152
Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.	15033.747506912863
For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother.	14690.82587614711
In a recent public controversy with Mr L.	6840.294735709833
Bloom (Pubb.	5894.772046022199
Canv.) which took place in the commons ’ hall of the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A.	9986.224558154343

At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.	12343.61224812322
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy <URL> It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor.	15907.648792332922
All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped.	11679.854685163287
She had.	2027.7759971027288
She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy.	9218.400576610942
Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene.	14933.016003447088
Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband.	13818.888429153683
And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God ’ s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces.	13031.79727623522
He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch.	12821.662861003017
O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days.	13064.608039275405
God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose.	14690.404787272699
Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer ’ s office, Dublin Castle.	13959.047571435807
And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here.	8943.373964482274
No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina.	9840.228191532691
And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.	14079.253632619308
He knows and will call in His own good time.	6825.965727394603
You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man ’ s part.	9228.025404798895
Sir, to you my hand.	8806.223050109873
Well done, thou good and faithful servant! There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait.	14019.623340618902
He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.	13067.132562629711
Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.	14450.48841757308
Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.	13639.733991672001
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair, _ for the cruder things of life.	12981.22284702852
A scene disengages itself in the observer ’ s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.	13524.206339233677
A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock.	13877.153552335629
And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.	14566.906613390627
A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.	13677.275279765998
He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad look.	14476.030437159685
Mark this farther and remember.	12039.165299025404
The end comes suddenly.	5097.09157670133
Enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces.	14089.557593807906
Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent.	11539.235766695836
Quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago.	15544.143965884936
But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word.	14364.626102479077

In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot.	10935.329534176766
A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.) _ Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.	11239.297717974126
His (Stephen ’ s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman ’ s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral.	12509.512145090075
But how to get there was the rub.	8007.7312305581745
For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned.	13516.306698218126
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier ’ s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin ’ s.	12222.898536332938
But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.	12293.720662746187
This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did.	12947.866624118013
So, bevelling around by Mullett ’ s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance.	12271.884478832922
So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey.	13404.530672489182
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company ’ s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back.	12337.84544591668
They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.	14162.84339239389
Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird ’ s the stonecutter ’ s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke ’ s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable.	13325.089406005423
Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke ’ s the baker ’ s it is said.	10857.63244619666
_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn ’ t look out.	13741.862164126558
Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about.	13136.25008642668
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot.	12666.731898249707
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes.	13448.296996027768
Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything.	15095.224175493886
You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £.	12492.394748733652
s.	2490.9390909127424
d.	6161.321361397324
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically.	15148.101847860156
Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.	14697.510929436688
— And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.	7131.21239963785
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps.	13880.904269150364
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox.	12708.296816315204
He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father ’ s, Gumley.	11030.26425809628
To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.	10683.472055378208
— Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.	1540.345447634812
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling: — Night! Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment.	13788.75800787642
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least.	12352.98769187698
Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment ’ s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.	15052.091817953145
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley ’ s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice.	11555.82326572096
Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise.	13782.382066955583
His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.	14120.593422269858
Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen.	14223.123848928217
This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.	14368.164071071147
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.	11952.296463451568
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night ’ s lodgings.	10442.84679922444
His friends had all deserted him.	5685.393813435312
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions.	14062.750989681334
He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God ’ s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do.	8061.444170309505
No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn ’ t a complete fabrication from start to finish.	10555.11042927016
Anyhow he was all in.	7577.982454949439
— I wouldn ’ t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I ’ m on the rocks.	6849.355587849757
— There ’ ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys ’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher.	8596.377406144762
Try it.	2764.223207718086
You may mention my name.	5237.7687465610115
— Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn ’ t teach in a school, man.	6617.601620381063
I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.	8159.471486279855
I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers.	9449.856009400335
— I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.	4918.508939665011
Corley at the first go - off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street.	12156.7892714667
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney ’ s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M ’ Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob.	12772.708408907007
He was starving too though he hadn ’ t said a word about it.	5371.2170519250585
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen ’ s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley ’ s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence.	13368.438260707357
However _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished.	12273.702764338263
But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley ’ s head that he was living in affluence and hadn ’ t a thing to do but hand out the needful.	9769.670363040226
Whereas.	15443.024084639697
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing.	12842.955160489752
A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.	9417.650364853309
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact.	11066.755510706978
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.	9857.81480750825
About biscuits he dimly remembered.	12189.643076048582
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy.	12929.696641586488
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.	11344.293081590393
— Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.	5416.536181528744
And so in point of fact they turned out to be.	5368.508105292071
Stephen anyhow lent him one of them.	5460.6462666050575
— Thanks, Corley answered, you ’ re a gentleman.	4472.695576721284
I ’ ll pay you back one time.	2947.2896510261926
Who ’ s that with you?	2902.1579237624082
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.	9481.36782570031
You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there.	8130.396232353166
I ’ d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they ’ re full up for the next three weeks, man.	8350.09082391667
God, you ’ ve to book ahead, man, you ’ d think it was for the Carl Rosa.	8503.866755467327
I don ’ t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.	6856.90979139353
Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.	13262.322283404059
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman ’ s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept.	11379.720212239137
He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen ’ s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.	10233.810181299517
Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity.	15910.73949060093
Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether.	12153.44485242553
In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.	9253.509909019875
Pretty thick that was certainly.	14548.183997435553
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite.	11066.114607350968
Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is: — He is down on his luck.	9296.015740109748
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.	10068.274430185198
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively: — Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say.	12074.904935279175
Now you mention it his face was familiar to me.	7408.779883284543
But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?	10125.753241684073
— Half a crown, Stephen responded.	6975.025833490683
I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.	7541.315303677779
— Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does.	11078.997716305881
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds.	14652.124076476597
But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself?	9205.001289072308
Walking to Sandycove is out of the question.	7550.56904440847
And even supposing you did you won ’ t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station.	8947.469089140046
Simply fag out there for nothing.	11243.38906143511
I don ’ t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father ’ s house?	6917.851493480565
— To seek misfortune, was Stephen ’ s answer.	5461.638468194819
— I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday.	9321.11805099995
Where does he live at present?	9434.793824637705
I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.	7125.74696082935
— I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.	6600.252445211351
Why?	1336.6418951783915
— A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one.	7448.499174462762
He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you.	6563.580896621485
You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.	12745.796121818636
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen ’ s mind ’ s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that.	12597.265374950079
— No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn ’ t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes.	9780.03302993359
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.	9265.94032365222
Of course you didn ’ t notice as much as I did.	5721.058146482057
But it wouldn ’ t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.	11380.005095843993
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.	14208.445029229808
— Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.	10066.5876762028
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen ’ s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less.	12947.921000605415
Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.	15768.723988296058
Adjacent to the men ’ s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.	15177.931025480826
— _Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione?	10564.900199307682
Culo rotto! _ _ — Intendiamoci.	12454.15742457094
Mezzo sovrano più... _ _ — Dice lui, però! _ _ — <URL> _ — Farabutto! Mortacci sui! _ _ — Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più... _ Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman ’ s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin - the - Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in.	10981.9985963289
A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.	14289.159181237399
— Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.	10580.280345168962
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly.	14532.545538875835
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.	13654.476292134184
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious: — A beautiful language.	11798.907564642293
I mean for singing purposes.	5757.801812913778
Why do you not write your poetry in that language?	9753.151531827867
_Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious and full.	14306.23629685945
_Belladonna.	19456.598729469286
<URL> Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied: — To fill the ear of a cow elephant.	13524.470339177471
They were haggling over money.	4928.333790828112
— Is that so?	1711.9614228006287
Mr Bloom asked.	890.7170653928929
Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.	11035.585395730399
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête - à - tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.	11831.164149216393
After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to.	9670.308454551741
For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.	11782.105160867339
— Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names.	8721.029329128301
Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody.	17369.964018706578
Jesus, Mr Doyle.	10104.591845291574
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies.	17570.914065612873
What ’ s in a name?	1867.5299624874654
— Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred.	3154.7499515413942
Of course.	3262.922765946297
Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.	11830.828411436682
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking: — And what might your name be?	12055.213049026826
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion ’ s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered: — Dedalus.	13671.424422194345
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.	11207.713098245606
— You know Simon Dedalus?	3563.6123050640545
he asked at length.	6331.312235848388
— I ’ ve heard of him, Stephen said.	1475.5679833650154
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.	6330.816403131211
— He ’ s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding.	7574.488668081152
All Irish.	4956.762550994751
— All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.	6856.598941209518
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark: — I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder.	11569.907965346714
The lefthand dead shot.	5621.617405779097
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.	14493.818691042141
— Bottles out there, say.	4153.145820428878
Fifty yards measured.	18227.54902377354
Eggs on the bottles.	17988.060839863898
Cocks his gun over his shoulder.	10061.768318159728
Aims.	19456.598729469286
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely.	8063.32233504427
Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.	11741.637040798818
— Pom! he then shouted once.	5605.725615062756
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.	10855.050054689898
— Pom! he shouted twice.	5376.144036758419
Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily: _ — Buffalo Bill shoots to kill, Never missed nor he never <URL> A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness ’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.	15714.690798852773
— Long ago?	4720.919220798137
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.	6784.879377445834
— Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years.	9552.713469109623
He toured the wide world with Hengler ’ s Royal Circus.	9466.616427383138
I seen him do that in Stockholm.	7278.534341412958
— Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.	6484.45258896895
— Murphy ’ s my name, the sailor continued.	6201.697439911597
D.	2024.9303961274736
B.	1761.314203247806
Murphy of Carrigaloe.	15868.195079096857
Know where that is?	10241.700861807158
— Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.	7183.458760177005
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle.	14897.828325635543
That ’ s where I hails from.	3188.7784313158136
I belongs there.	2751.5412203804412
That ’ s where I hails from.	3188.7784313158136
My little woman ’ s down there.	4616.869338221136
She ’ s waiting for me, I know.	3401.3833409415765
_For England, home and beauty_.	16113.147565903133
She ’ s my own true wife I haven ’ t seen for seven years now, sailing about.	7291.693602527651
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner ’ s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon.	11758.943727283926
Across the world for a wife.	8015.542640507469
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O ’ Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.	12862.596787128625
Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee.	13641.22771762066
The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections.	13093.37720163087
You little expected me but I ’ ve come to stay and make a fresh start.	10621.304417103915
There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside.	10411.315909716677
Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep.	15732.260280234948
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions.	10574.8004239083
No chair for father.	5935.1997109651575
Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, _post mortem_ child.	15452.11657607436
With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable.	12910.225713130963
Grin and bear it.	8177.081041939718
I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W.	8083.624355650151
B.	1761.314203247806
Murphy.	11785.351918411056
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request: — You don ’ t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?	9248.778737423749
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.	12501.498357561892
— Thank you, the sailor said.	1964.0749636879152
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded: — We come up this morning eleven o ’ clock.	11099.915926886593
The threemaster _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	7118.236561132724
I shipped to get over.	5264.757780709126
Paid off this afternoon.	15976.546044283334
There ’ s my discharge.	3199.5984904840266
See?	4972.029263439174
D.	2024.9303961274736
B.	1761.314203247806
Murphy.	11785.351918411056
A.	567.5270913964941
B.	1761.314203247806
S.	1192.4711296144715
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.	13413.367131551327
— You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.	6847.66566472569
— Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I ’ ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on.	7010.237571491153
I was in the Red Sea.	2721.5645998526097
I was in China and North America and South America.	6339.180984599332
We was chased by pirates one voyage.	11278.544118447011
I seen icebergs plenty, growlers.	7162.835266569625
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship.	10320.323004399559
I seen Russia.	4337.1431710127
_Gospodi pomilyou_.	18679.07077551165
That ’ s how the Russians prays.	4333.772224624245
— You seen queer sights, don ’ t be talking, put in a jarvey.	5038.849677143123
— Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.	6955.589206864585
I seen queer things too, ups and downs.	8672.839879087607
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.	10424.808857659238
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously: — Khaan! Like that.	8757.341283017871
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses.	10803.447891666792
Look here.	3996.5936876107025
Here they are.	4773.502369576691
A friend of mine sent me.	4663.471406679861
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.	9585.843638902808
The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios.	10404.942070734885
Beni, <URL> All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.	15383.659825285242
— Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added.	7318.771594961001
Stomachs like breadgraters.	18227.54902377354
Cuts off their diddies when they can ’ t bear no more children.	11616.093935433379
See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse ’ s liver raw.	13596.192894464924
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more.	11207.09371898807
— Know how to keep them off?	6722.6813038655155
he inquired generally.	8515.378210550356
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying: — Glass.	11617.177441774289
That boggles ’ em.	6961.174468169099
Glass.	12523.931486793172
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.	9970.229279100271
It ran as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, <URL> There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.	12656.643496325281
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo - Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which occasion the former ’ s ball passed through the latter ’ s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict <URL>. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend ’ s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.	14758.091198327176
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through.	12945.861064693609
But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd ’ s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.	12796.26744835651
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with.	13405.433753809695
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.	14497.092246321605
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M ’ Coy type lend me your valise and I ’ ll post you the ticket.	9392.400459769424
No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy - Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody - Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure.	13555.030634935087
That was the rub.	3583.0064816781082
Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard - Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally.	13971.405409152192
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.	12889.20444032012
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn ’ t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d ’ œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O ’ Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men ’ s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour ’ s run from the pillar.	13916.161954682379
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired.	11186.111324331878
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact.	13194.086235658151
He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.	6883.269105485257
— I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different.	10315.920520610629
One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower.	10965.831811164682
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.	14788.464044627393
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.	16037.411146523878
— And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.	7170.723714443544
Knife in his back.	6829.382230778009
Knife like that.	4395.71592176531
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.	12890.767803718409
— In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.	9789.874814196455
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.	9193.902245830064
Like that.	1751.4626034088155
_Prepare to meet your God_, says he.	6796.377294315291
Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.	14012.21947614275
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to.	10955.893207562583
— That ’ s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable _stiletto_.	4941.634424291668
After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.	14098.345966672861
— They ’ re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all.	7761.221591282353
That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.	10772.347723251789
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin - the - Goat, _alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair.	12877.144014277168
His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn ’ t understand one jot of what was going on.	10409.636009290925
Funny, very! There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.	14994.720983765652
Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.	7611.591595469315
He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.	12826.289086342023
— Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.	3641.240999369192
Give us back them papers.	8301.986747240404
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.	9632.505412953587
— Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar?	5326.750666919182
Mr Bloom inquired.	3328.1045821651924
The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no.	8013.1499906348145
— Ah, you ’ ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.	9683.387264196488
— What year would that be about?	4870.618406173752
Mr B interrogated.	6647.385261689979
Can you recall the boats?	9256.765825482304
Our _soi - disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering: — I ’ m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.	7816.058534709774
Salt junk all the time.	5251.444865299969
Tired seemingly, he ceased.	14701.641228419248
His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves.	12578.226166305625
On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings.	13950.669425843253
And it left him wondering why.	6630.489321799664
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.	12870.59791165337
And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all.	7806.07490112325
Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.	14267.94998122253
— There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman ’ s valet at six quid a month.	10438.42484649813
Them are his trousers I ’ ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.	13553.429973661068
I ’ m game for that job, shaving and brushup.	5325.40313816968
I hate roaming about.	3874.893627490273
There ’ s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper ’ s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.	10038.367130289507
— What age is he?	2276.2719395909376
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.	13836.313755584353
— Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?	7881.577371140531
He ’ d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.	5259.196036696195
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor.	12926.445731890599
— There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.	9113.874816545751
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.	5494.195217529927
It ’ s them black lads I objects to.	4341.905470002415
I hate those buggers.	4881.641740016038
Suck your blood dry, they does.	14303.86417027857
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner ’ s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <NUM> and a young man ’ s sideface looking frowningly rather.	13308.615014202487
— Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.	7576.737896713706
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.	10099.576486491656
Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that.	8329.235204234992
There he is himself, a Greek.	6683.11194337454
one asked the sailor.	14643.39476957185
That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.	8588.27455642886
Someway in his.	12759.801138321824
Squeezing or.	14855.255256694074
— See here, he said, showing Antonio.	3996.61480190447
There he is cursing the mate.	6593.118586004582
And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.	10357.742818432085
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio ’ s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin - the - Goat, who this time stretched over.	10706.492450746262
— Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.	6323.525172661781
He ’ s gone too.	1161.4301264054425
Ate by sharks after.	11518.09193362638
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.	9352.779232673101
— Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.	5704.65183275708
— And what ’ s the number for?	2529.5923642028606
loafer number two queried.	15976.304393411037
a third asked the sailor.	13494.540113599627
— Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number.	9191.116903296208
Ate.	16997.075953601572
A Greek he was.	3557.5209951744114
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.	11173.447259776462
Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink.	11699.699057040425
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of his washing.	12623.125771866167
Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing.	14107.18101437566
Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife ’ s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man ’ s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper ’ s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt.	11971.37074364206
Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female ’ s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off.	13850.820943240798
Round the side of the _Evening Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy ’ s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.	10343.128658080717
— The gunboat, the keeper said.	2937.566499668641
— It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least.	11076.352098915237
Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.	14849.593731045581
Still no matter what the cause is from...	5002.456909374739
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking: — In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade.	13936.13746730689
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul.	14301.343166838571
She is a bad merchant.	6918.336621897291
She buys dear and sells cheap.	8846.367263106673
The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start.	12510.918102641945
Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.	11199.209276890753
— You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul.	9299.418877498514
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup.	10659.66401865916
I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter.	10791.840156083344
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance.	11801.340012537408
Do you?	1754.1986817638224
Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say: — They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible.	14070.377711825822
It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette.	13431.177480380893
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining: — Simple?	11952.902636330298
I shouldn ’ t think that is the proper word.	6534.818616837485
Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon.	10673.136884284266
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it ’ s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.	11907.44669080056
— O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.	11328.366306423723
On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.	14482.041245656159
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief.	13657.022282793738
I ’ m not so sure about that.	2063.785617635389
That ’ s a matter for everyman ’ s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_ there.	8323.811925676728
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it ’ s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn ’ t tell you.	11197.94009957591
Can ’ t you drink that coffee, by the way?	4889.801774493665
Let me stir it.	3546.538479222083
And take a piece of that bun.	8760.034534950351
It ’ s like one of our skipper ’ s bricks disguised.	6756.075387364499
Still no - one can give what he hasn ’ t got.	8884.87526989992
Try a bit.	6695.540130046991
— Couldn ’ t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.	9699.54464590699
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders.	12973.591171618253
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying.	11049.902048813346
The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of.	10112.64616087067
Sulphate of copper poison SO<NUM> or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn ’ t remember when it was or where.	13013.931587210911
Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble ’ s Vi - Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.	13428.17361841964
— Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.	10073.005518450269
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.	16201.948907035357
— Still it ’ s solid food, his good genius urged, I ’ m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental or manual.	10458.249119629632
You ought to eat more solid food.	7073.864325278316
You would feel a different man.	4927.947894748595
— Liquids I can eat, Stephen said.	2614.009234409608
But O, oblige me by taking away that knife.	10558.618311878672
I can ’ t look at the point of it.	2340.579347528225
It reminds me of Roman history.	7991.449569034847
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.	11692.67761356621
— Our mutual friend ’ s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_.	9877.839083196655
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots.	10775.055758569451
Look at him.	2047.784824789016
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.	13344.263966639952
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.	8423.85667756499
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.	15362.906940155566
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described.	14203.92346662546
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera.	13561.420257654823
And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn ’ t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.	10514.476471071239
— Mind you, I ’ m not saying that it ’ s all a pure invention, he resumed.	5730.504833232583
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.	13498.556276564224
Giants, though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen.	12557.939717722289
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn ’ t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods.	13091.193393220936
There ’ s an example again of simple souls.	5559.595098033096
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded.	14530.031777739494
On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.	13541.961107834806
— Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen.	13113.499130163076
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.	10214.943012087166
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is.	6395.558158181899
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, <URL>. Gibraltar.	15227.1738995894
She has the Spanish type.	6765.693083659034
Quite dark, regular brunette, black.	12152.597887708092
I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character.	8672.0771351152
That ’ s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.	6616.5628235575505
— The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings.	7394.304261641078
_Roberto ruba roba sua_.	17932.61452774436
— Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.	4152.5653646793435
— Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.	11637.632380248504
— It ’ s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.	2547.77201074502
All are washed in the blood of the sun.	4111.699923718008
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there.	10017.320122065898
The splendid proportions of hips, bosom.	8523.723625163871
You simply don ’ t knock against those kind of women here.	7139.360775298823
An exception here and there.	4895.167592861867
Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I ’ m talking about is the female form.	10149.997850600288
Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman ’ s natural beauty, no matter what you say.	10572.1470250838
Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it ’ s a thing I simply hate to see.	9097.929260861307
Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.	12668.870296347164
Shipahoy of course had his own say to say.	11752.698521605907
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.	10741.229264023812
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt ’ s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand.	13930.189421872268
That was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror.	12905.87748827473
Then someone said something about the case of the s.	7426.798983787118
s.	2490.9390909127424
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck.	16583.883088490096
No aid was given.	8559.564644638838
Her master, the _Mona_ ’ s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.	8972.8976292506
She had no water, it appears, in her hold.	8902.232083252438
At this stage an incident happened.	9822.77740288018
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.	10865.520454151361
— Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.	8932.361628627534
He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left.	9697.175223115899
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship ’ s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise.	12681.573969181827
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.	13060.965578677686
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.	14434.622314174476
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.	11252.751805311565
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ <NUM> a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.	15370.705914391741
And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver.	8920.975653900432
He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if — a big if, however — he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.	13036.976419091434
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing.	11756.564855331913
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year.	11516.184113634868
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.	13657.094772856399
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh?	11232.843299309614
Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day ’ s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.	14466.901404904023
— Am I right, skipper?	6488.149042705384
he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.	11593.254952406838
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds.	13391.395102142676
Mr Bloom ’ s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question.	10746.754242612327
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation - _cum_ - potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook: — The biscuits was as hard as brass And the beef as salt as Lot ’ s wife ’ s arse.	14058.27957282696
Skin - the - Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible - feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God ’ s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein.	13744.874838605812
Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact.	10643.732642337185
You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.	11631.853895772312
But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes.	12709.074061544407
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.	10198.074745362665
The Boers were the beginning of the end.	6781.786212148958
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot.	16087.183164501552
His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.	11129.252551252792
Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.	13535.254449673259
Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_.	16669.72940657173
The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.	9975.294453865688
— Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.	10762.18783523319
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.	12155.053682597098
— Who ’ s the best troops in the army?	3665.29026275743
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated.	12449.747762597068
And the best jumpers and racers?	5893.864216927986
And the best admirals and generals we ’ ve got?	7768.967168018988
Tell me that.	4113.516550567843
— The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.	9058.404072592972
— That ’ s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.	3148.9918453698306
The Irish catholic peasant.	6121.162194249984
He ’ s the backbone of our empire.	3041.933167127927
You know Jem Mullins?	6049.949744284578
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.	13926.590012970886
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn ’ t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.	11558.664769084477
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.	14019.164142831363
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart.	13877.967344912875
Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact.	12997.078914927642
And now, why?	4519.153013649137
So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.	12067.973275000044
And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn ’ t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn ’ t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen ’ s evidence or king ’ s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.	12940.472179048971
Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.	15163.957538194936
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin - the - Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.	13508.687221445616
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin - the - etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.	11018.0914432919
He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.	6445.947437327446
Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.	11063.037916573838
Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.	14095.136465094312
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £.	11400.722834988079
s.	2490.9390909127424
d.	6161.321361397324
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin and so on.	10555.381162779813
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.	13274.724118162725
— He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.	10664.352505658877
He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively.	9132.025019853185
So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I ’ m not.	9269.45074658775
A soft answer turns away wrath.	8433.94953544488
He hadn ’ t a word to say for himself as everyone saw.	7026.841141226875
Am I not right?	9677.835416794485
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn ’ t all exactly.	10660.824066654975
— _Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any other, _secundum carnem_.	13316.413658890413
— Of course, Mr B.	3652.5172024847584
proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question.	12857.215067812747
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves.	12870.30650858455
But with a little goodwill all round.	7497.855206938374
It ’ s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.	7115.984319461378
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form.	8395.524779703486
It never reaches anything or stops anything.	8021.12177272907
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan.	10530.877676356184
It ’ s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak.	7095.620812815081
— Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes ’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner ’ s alley and Ormond market.	12141.090318181317
And the whole world was full of that sort of thing.	5187.038916461974
— You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.	3151.0809512178967
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn ’ t remotely...	4810.1716682542865
All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.	13438.233715424329
— They accuse, remarked he audibly.	6496.050763817074
He turned away from the others, who probably … and spoke nearer to, so as the others … in case they … — Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen ’ s ear, are accused of ruining.	10976.873852310646
History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them.	14337.451103213536
Why?	1336.6418951783915
Because they are imbued with the proper spirit.	11312.568353325742
They are practical and are proved to be so.	6772.419705440703
I don ’ t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are.	6523.227816230203
But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty.	11739.007856000677
Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America.	15917.02728508651
Turks.	19456.598729469286
It ’ s in the dogma.	2374.2424643168647
Because if they didn ’ t believe they ’ d go straight to heaven when they die they ’ d try to live better, at least so I think.	9046.41340618034
That ’ s the juggle on which the <URL>. ’ s raise the wind on false pretences.	6856.069658757975
I ’ m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ <NUM> per annum.	11598.586269570833
That ’ s the vital issue at stake and it ’ s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man.	7023.666147602117
At least that ’ s my idea for what it ’ s worth.	6780.692692683632
I call that patriotism.	6084.251238340566
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_.	16372.246738223193
Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.	8935.598370377462
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.	13198.481407744268
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to.	10583.468681443608
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn ’ t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.	8908.118442278472
— Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.	9426.884635662518
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem.	11338.083896312011
observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.	15453.233874560929
— I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense.	6176.684087507276
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing.	9935.15358630177
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.	15437.617890660442
That ’ s work too.	1626.8955536316917
Important work.	12492.203193407448
After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price.	12366.890007892074
You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.	12024.123697323881
What?	572.8670519115202
You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.	10785.311708128775
Each is equally important.	15393.126810427384
— You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called Ireland for short.	9720.215378813264
— I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.	5351.12820751482
— But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.	7446.08613759204
— What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension.	9412.332859009513
Excuse me.	3873.2482371699016
What was it you...?	2151.9220727241072
Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: — We can ’ t change the country.	10172.775586091622
Let us change the subject.	8231.926161762089
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn ’ t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry.	9969.449708095633
The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part.	8113.340170095255
Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state.	15352.738392000416
Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn ’ t been familiarised with the right sort of people.	13171.335893158355
With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves.	13793.29691968695
For instance there was the case of O ’ Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact).	12532.311939322151
And then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.	13368.116844459986
Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it.	13239.432776761583
Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental.	14946.006116029912
However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps.	12780.401998746356
Sheer force of natural genius, that.	9965.636665474
With brains, sir.	2834.0205263241423
For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it.	12174.816921232295
Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small.	14672.111047001314
Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind.	12951.786764170667
Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz.	14237.709575284498
coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the microscope lately.	15951.03033079458
To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column.	12809.94074233982

Guesswork it reduced itself to eventually.	17570.71474456905
— There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.	5484.645813882939
— Who?	651.1040733368873
the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.	7368.728666312129

Then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his senses.	10572.23270697705
Dead he wasn ’ t.	4540.013878627926
Simply absconded somewhere.	10956.40988551676
The coffin they brought over was full of stones.	7322.931343377909
He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general.	9859.020584142434
He made a mistake to fight the priests.	7331.623140543495
And so forth and so on.	3283.0214215793408
All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years.	12669.383390098528
Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered.	14738.36059218947
Something evidently riled them in his death.	8856.021331603524
Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands.	15452.28830334289
Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility.	14620.24852669538
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren ’ t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between.	14994.724680114723
It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging.	12928.87027051286
And the identical same with murderers.	6199.346095542343
You had to come back.	4051.0030688826464
That haunting sense kind of drew you.	6726.065297327907
To show the understudy in the title _rôle_ how to.	9791.58680698093
He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_ or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what ’ s bred in the bone.	11815.782844813424
Still as regards return.	8146.285147663002
You were a lucky dog if they didn ’ t set the terrier at you directly you got back.	8235.8889750075
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against.	10786.268100162468
And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat ’ s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or some such commonplace remark.	13585.650535233699
A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.	11413.390998901466
— That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented.	8435.169925351078
She put the first nail in his coffin.	7735.881310206291
— Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi - disant_ townclerk Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her.	7980.639707619792
She loosened many a man ’ s thighs.	6441.382095828384
I seen her picture in a barber ’ s.	4686.272392289755
The husband was a captain or an officer.	8750.012756298775
— Ay, Skin - the - Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.	4724.678801540586
This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_.	14351.436376866015
As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings.	13762.380233805108
First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into.	14713.43145696928
Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of.	13817.092380969068
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one ’ s smiles.	14592.317952158104
Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk?	12783.7085270825
Poser.	19456.598729469286
Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly.	13766.684558184736
A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the <NUM> th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass ’ s kick.	13684.473364608779
Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream.	11682.124602251413
And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times.	12278.613303366914
Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side.	10727.255453412581
North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn ’ t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.	13640.63950464847
— Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun.	7642.324487074998
And, if I don ’ t greatly mistake she was Spanish too.	4644.917182903231
— The king of Spain ’ s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.	10706.844834604966
— Was she?	2568.1913172956974
Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour before.	11208.39624789974
Possible, especially there, it was as she lived there.	11223.21053164878
So, Spain.	7531.015610914939
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he.	12483.174477663944
— Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?	6846.836665970091
Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue.	13763.769004877162
Her (the lady ’ s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin ’ s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.	12419.169386295578
— Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated.	10292.758716161545
Taken a few years since.	14062.566597798954
In or about ninety six.	7227.7496366504765
Very like her then.	7088.849967595811
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen.	14525.14380433196
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup.	12278.046226561886
She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the.	8350.8511594602
He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum.	11219.209492259375
Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest.	11933.682917502285
Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint Joseph ’ s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop.	11582.328934337394
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn ’ t art in a word.	10119.779670731128
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar ’ s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to.	13395.591595204238
But it was scarcely professional etiquette so.	5956.441443523548
Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.	12313.114643288101
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.	11098.015718093144
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other ’ s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_.	15510.271417856971
In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out.	11962.65413364618
Suppose she was gone when he?	8554.464629338469
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.	13926.036756579104
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn ’ t think he had it in him yet you would.	10920.163655668151
Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter.	13399.40737373883
And why not?	3330.308303928059
How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate.	14179.675542521409
But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course.	12574.068619346654
He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin ’ s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader ’ s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader ’ s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O ’ Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune ’ s private morals.	13354.917031015148
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive.	13993.026796106898
As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap ’ s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character.	13687.801120055246
His hat (Parnell ’ s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what ’ s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother ’ s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.	12440.4853611002
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another ’ s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others.	13785.443215041649
He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn ’ t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.	13930.253522574214
It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime.	12872.54178207737
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies ’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ’ ways and flowers and chocs.	13994.495722857013
To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age.	13187.447786435343
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other ’ s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.	13557.375198770025
— At what o ’ clock did you dine?	7719.955032058853
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.	10707.353611846367
— Some time yesterday, Stephen said.	1923.2234180829607
— Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday.	10317.055063023012
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.	16655.912967511173
Though they didn ’ t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought.	9591.849697004951
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.	13168.068123853094
For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people ’ s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn ’ t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan ’ s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	13920.595403708021
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night.	9346.866898899341
On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives.	10070.184989795844
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.	13060.208984196914
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway.	11298.242957161727
For one thing he mightn ’ t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn ’ t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.	12699.87431786969
At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps ’ s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.	14085.580021582788
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn ’ t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger ’ s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character ’ s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids ’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody ’ s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks _passim_.	14562.70670872576
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.	11289.931985807198
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep.	15352.288199586745
The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles.	8745.578140456448
Your god was a jew.	7029.273067433879
Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick - on - Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.	13118.763278485798
— I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it ’ s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over.	9323.094781845111
My diggings are quite close in the vicinity.	10479.385777707703
You can ’ t drink that stuff.	4709.757145486832
Do you like cocoa?	6493.185736137186
Wait.	1316.9653973396455
I ’ ll just pay this lot.	3029.4626073101886
The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn ’ t seem to.	10593.3368388655
— Yes, that ’ s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.	6625.496157395385
An opening was all was wanted.	11144.795580047014
Because he more than suspected he had his father ’ s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.	9867.826355430854
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers ’ association dinner in London somewhere.	11276.790830082558
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary ’ s lodge or words to that effect.	12391.520759225517
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.	9686.806616401656
— Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.	9763.815030403048
— And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.	6986.949264593114
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.	9436.426502703398
— Are you bad in the eyes?	4867.1753413757715
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried.	12446.64787227927
— Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.	11015.370021289833
Sand in the Red Sea done that.	9564.181083327556
One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking.	9220.579142618326
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite and _Red as a Rose is <URL> Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.	14886.455238095932
To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee <NUM> d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.	13972.699091762883
— Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.	6531.667957664171
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_.	15545.227909650723
Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.	8797.697690875999
— One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment.	6934.1624245866215
Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés.	10966.190576826366
To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment ’ s hesitation, saying straight off: — To sweep the floor in the morning.	10685.942439818176
So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion ’ s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles.	11702.488275945725
The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.	10919.70521480906
— It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment.	7805.668191721454
The only thing is to walk then you ’ ll feel a different man.	7124.805726239416
Come.	2315.859250724524
It ’ s not far.	1889.6923757734303
Lean on me.	5928.897715930451
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen ’ s right and led him on accordingly.	10775.188973718508
— Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.	7676.129051100489
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc.	14072.418990723972
where the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new.	13272.432669595397
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.	12941.895647359783
So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place.	12770.495654642295
Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go - off but the music of Mercadante ’ s _Huguenots_, Meyerbeer ’ s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart ’ s _Twelfth Mass_ he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat.	14201.049940013065
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be_.	13825.164657345656
He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini ’ s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers ’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather.	13739.178257546328
There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore.	10831.788399447354
On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_, a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn.	12620.407487503287
And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel ’ s air in _Martha, M ’ appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen ’ s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.	11693.349278078354
Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn ’ t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare ’ s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B.	12684.593819450847
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen ’ s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.	12507.893214501892
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.	13821.29345025113
He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.	10304.351265131167
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other ’ s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking: — Our lives are in peril tonight.	12078.711202983975
Beware of the steamroller.	14342.330068592097
They thereupon stopped.	5161.399799594077
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts.	13559.207887380097
He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world.	6162.617688896642
But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan ’ s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face.	7955.831232292654
But it was no animal ’ s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.	12169.4254868247
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees.	13860.855803053288
Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye.	14720.862405153093
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen ’ s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.	12172.15715383734
— What ’ s this I was saying?	2711.144562657428
Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.	11973.61595185218
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.	12857.922621131964
Still, supposing he had his father ’ s gift as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall ’ s Irish industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.	12322.141835374085
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from.	15914.39786496477
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit: Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten.	15214.922747441786
These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_.	15313.717191975486
Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did.	9904.558608641173
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B.	14086.984272961146
A.	567.5270913964941
(a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society ’ s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you.	13925.980682433252
Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.	13839.57850096616
Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time.	11823.087798460883
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.	14441.355618165704
Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin ’ s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_.	14459.379610746753
Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city ’ s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows.	12921.039095712596
And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone.	12412.129986119648
The horse was just then.	4499.582396622792
And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom ’ s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person ’ s character, no pun intended.	14178.73666381281
The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds.	11439.953020795989
Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired.	13437.579735140082
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.	12393.774831583623
Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.	14475.207801951741
Und alle Schiffe brücken.	17932.61452774436
The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by Father Maher_.	13397.663183530394
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies of man ’ s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn ’ t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.	12104.537613408382
What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?	10270.749965337107
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner ’ s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.	13990.634903976954
Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George ’ s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.	15077.548658004685
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?	11224.928088397794
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen ’ s collapse.	13567.099598531322
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?	13951.914373218284
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial.	15160.29434638374
Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence.	14072.112405495764
Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines.	15759.065212918747
Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.	14089.733988788283
Were their views on some points divergent?	13951.985168495234
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom ’ s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen ’ s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.	10801.207786818755
Bloom assented covertly to Stephen ’ s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year <NUM> in the reign of Leary to the year <NUM> or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt († <NUM> <URL>.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree.	13020.21834498457
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman ’ s hand.	13000.220013460417
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?	14292.099775493803
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.	9143.576766038897
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?	12708.421863543526
In <NUM> with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard ’ s corner and Leonard ’ s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.	11078.134216405342
In <NUM> with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross.	12807.970142292213
In <NUM> occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines.	13424.002088819601
In <NUM> frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon ’ s house in Roundtown.	11125.232718953968
Once in <NUM> and once in <NUM> with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom ’ s) house in Lombard street, west.	11547.496237007043
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?	5469.09393764632
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.	12832.03675820516
As in what ways?	10176.153002569752
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.	14817.253293005971
At the housesteps of the <NUM> th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number <NUM> Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.	11848.884513529341
Was it there?	6171.773593032804
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.	8578.86828045982
Why was he doubly irritated?	8785.958953203053
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.	10492.859554523324
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?	12100.421663757303
To enter or not to enter.	9353.881226935071
To knock or not to knock.	8577.57934195425
Bloom ’ s decision?	4577.942291377143
A stratagem.	4762.787687825449
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.	14796.958583682985
Did he fall?	7058.708772156359
By his body ’ s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of <NUM> Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number <NUM>, epact <NUM>, solar cycle <NUM>, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction <NUM>, Julian period <NUM>, MCMIV.	15193.965096826487
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?	9711.490824324925
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?	10937.477558421866
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of <NUM> CP, a man lighting a candle of <NUM> CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle.	13841.378436924966
Did the man reappear elsewhere?	9939.343742462554
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor.	13894.747129249843
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.	8916.722927945142
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.	9181.030998891605
Did Stephen obey his sign?	10690.034402560348
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man ’ s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom ’ s house.	10695.192692523322
What did Bloom do?	3196.4257214483123
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M ’ Donald of <NUM> D ’ Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.	14515.36693917982
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?	10434.991907085714
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at <NUM> Usher ’ s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at <NUM> Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier <NUM>: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics ’ theatre of university College, <NUM> Stephen ’ s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father ’ s house in Cabra.	12071.478255734715
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?	12166.72269890192
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies ’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.	15712.209882480665
What did Bloom see on the range?	6670.752657276303
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.	11933.644003078147
What did Bloom do at the range?	5822.132337052506
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.	12221.937725668336
Yes.	804.865728120872
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of <NUM> million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ <NUM> per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the <NUM> acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of <NUM> statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of <NUM> feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of <NUM> / <NUM> million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.	14918.666640606274
E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in <NUM>) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of <NUM> gallons per day per pauper supplied through a <NUM> inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of <NUM> gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.	14252.969260747548
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?	11835.816901119118
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator ’ s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding <NUM> fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of <NUM> to <NUM> over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting <NUM> % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine % marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.	15887.470803761498
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?	15474.701471526485
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington ’ s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.	14685.917634217383
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom ’ s offer?	9001.346798663113
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.	13855.16753428474
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?	14122.209366247333
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.	9500.976942267416
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?	10079.205901332814
Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.	16479.564727329773
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?	11809.351353664859
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.	16623.31399630162
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?	10631.184982072466
The phenomenon of ebullition.	6549.046155587141
Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether.	16103.797610734513
Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of <NUM> thermal units needed to raise <NUM> pound of water from <NUM> ° to <NUM> ° Fahrenheit.	15036.447062510711
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?	10542.468402383247
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.	11290.815672103816
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?	12518.843984230885
To shave himself.	5073.462923871457
What advantages attended shaving by night?	7763.187477556298
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman ’ s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.	14654.06635563746
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?	10965.082248358029
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.	11575.838834654896
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?	12445.836077749898
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.	12685.288091412778
What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?	11503.78650805931
On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits.	14354.27284149654
On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences.	11865.470398292864
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?	11004.318847399756
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered <NUM>, <NUM>.	10593.420133413545
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?	8905.98320307514
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_, late pink edition, in the cabman ’ s shelter, at Butt bridge.	11670.477580540208
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?	11692.196314690913
In Bernard Kiernan ’ s licensed premises <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street: in David Byrne ’ s licensed premises, <NUM> Duke street: in O ’ Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon ’ s when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F.	10802.75938613896
W.	4493.51389505916
Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M.	12665.877918816122
(Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the _Freeman ’ s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, <NUM> Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.	12282.04561240664
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?	9368.575798655642
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.	14724.201291360903
His mood?	6055.98139396054
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.	7502.452904761127
What satisfied him?	4294.787630849805
To have sustained no positive loss.	10029.092834594407
Light to the gentiles.	13082.153468850514
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?	10003.138652802865
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps ’ s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.	13609.387830961485
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?	10873.5365556812
Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).	13223.843940518598
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?	12921.891628113817
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps ’ s massproduct, the creature cocoa.	13367.196061855358
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?	14835.286511740753
The reparation of a fissure of the length of <NUM> / <NUM> inches in the right side of his guest ’ s jacket.	10318.0901635744
A gift to his guest of one of the four lady ’ s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.	9696.14939970761
Who drank more quickly?	9827.347995329506
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent ’ s one, six to two, nine to three.	13318.896073578671
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?	9368.575798655642
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.	14610.154467151628
Had he found their solution?	10259.031263873143
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points.	13371.827809760112
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of <NUM> in <NUM> on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of <NUM> / -, <NUM> / - and <NUM> respectively for competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?	12378.331303112009
An ambition to squint At my verses in print Makes me hope that for these you ’ ll find room.	11997.728041202674
If you so condescend Then please place at the end The name of yours truly, L.	9578.142468871649
Bloom.	1055.12144237401
Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?	10128.73754053521
Name, age, race, creed.	16158.668927547236
What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?	10586.120653523456
Leopold Bloom Ellpodbomool Molldopeloob Bollopedoom Old Ollebo, M.	9032.360535683943
P.	998.8985605994484
What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the <NUM> February <NUM>?	12619.907474247826
Poets oft have sung in rhyme Of music sweet their praise divine.	17115.978107251347
Let them hymn it nine times nine.	9090.575567496639
Dearer far than song or wine.	15316.369686821074
You are mine.	2893.830156597909
The world is mine.	3866.595366013662
What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R.	10017.265331732504
G.	7324.408808463109
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (<NUM> January <NUM>) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.	11146.20785954847
Shelton <NUM> December <NUM>, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A.	13223.019449934169
Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal girl?	15792.329260841554
Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born <NUM>, acceded <NUM>) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist ’ s non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist ’ s revelations of white articles of non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from _Everybody ’ s Book of Jokes_ (<NUM> pages and a laugh in every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.	15067.395599899502
What relation existed between their ages?	9368.788348602548
<NUM> years before in <NUM> when Bloom was of Stephen ’ s present age Stephen was <NUM>.	9257.244552225162
<NUM> years after in <NUM> when Stephen would be of Bloom ’ s present age Bloom would be <NUM>.	9625.443682374593
The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.	11747.562767149999
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?	10221.430406528985
The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon ’ s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s mother, Stephen being then of the age of <NUM> and reluctant to give his hand in salutation.	9296.924531624354
The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin ’ s hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s father and Stephen ’ s granduncle, Stephen being then <NUM> years older.	9492.349565224073
Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?	12909.131448663136
Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.	15216.076064026118
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?	11793.747289270494
Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen ’ s parents from <NUM> September <NUM> to <NUM> December <NUM> and had also resided during the years <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O ’ Dowd of <NUM> Prussia street where, during parts of the years <NUM> and <NUM>, she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of <NUM> Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.	11467.327962717103
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?	10940.512414075347
He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low ’ s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.	13606.831660426533
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?	12669.97954259929
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.	14819.985340272326
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?	11953.386218058069
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.	14207.8716642655
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?	13951.179085373484
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow ’ s _Physical Strength and How to Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.	13840.16365759235
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?	13339.44565664112
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.	15473.991468830009
Did either openly allude to their racial difference?	11838.18633852694
Neither.	15443.024084639697
What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom ’ s thoughts about Stephen ’ s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen ’ s thoughts about Bloom ’ s thoughts about Stephen?	6772.2052606977695
He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.	5548.305850526688
What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?	10947.22813248012
Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty).	12641.786673967878
Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).	10756.943039906932
Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?	13958.922108346362
Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M.	8069.257252400483
A., alone, in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James O ’ Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C.	9881.401170341442
C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	5521.718478137425
Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone C.	7882.588533472322
C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	5620.457962068503
Did they find their educational careers similar?	11776.986112151526
Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame ’ s school and the high school.	13119.78993480428
Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university.	15077.437763001824
Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?	9076.252262326558
Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.	10319.2572684181
What two temperaments did they individually represent?	9539.14079888336
The scientific.	4122.464502427211
The artistic.	4122.464502427211
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?	13445.94803112439
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.	14980.950742255462
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?	14699.12460417007
Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults.	10792.457447138306
They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.	14778.843443165337
What also stimulated him in his cogitations?	8841.727021391152
The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A.	8280.244651651137
James, the former by his <NUM> d bazaar at <NUM> George ’ s street, south, the latter at his <NUM> / <NUM> d shop and world ’ s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at <NUM> Henry street, admission <NUM> d, children <NUM> d: and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.	14456.391114377591

Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?	15428.48703309877
His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.	13173.557995401672
What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?	7678.0821331390425
Solitary hotel in mountain pass.	13170.042483667989

What?	572.8670519115202
In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel, Queen ’ s Hotel.	7931.065515153482
Queen ’ s Ho...	3417.297990497807
What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?	7021.64189996329
The Queen ’ s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the <NUM> June <NUM>, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of <NUM> parts of aconite liniment to <NUM> of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at <URL> <URL>. on the morning of <NUM> June <NUM> at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, <NUM> Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at <URL> <URL>. on the afternoon of <NUM> June <NUM> a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, <NUM> Main street, Ennis.	12053.46958964048
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?	11915.35064384723
Coincidence.	9031.408469903961
He preferred himself to see another ’ s face and listen to another ’ s words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.	10611.137199290044
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of the Plums_?	12544.348738681649
It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (<URL>. _My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon ’ s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, <NUM> June (S.	14650.929602919876
Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise <URL> <URL>., sunset <URL> <URL>. Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?	12764.797559815777
What to do with our wives.	7145.660375742659
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?	9241.001725403132
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.	16334.566935249024
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?	12359.283173369326
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters.	13201.624866788476
She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec.	11290.348684310586
She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external.	12829.591982277803
In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.	12728.242712182224
After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall.	15298.028456038677
Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_ (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).	14225.09142561462
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?	12969.688836014468
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction.	11096.714205942028
The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.	10839.771362932821
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?	12315.53109917298
Variously.	19456.598729469286
By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other ’ s ignorant lapse.	14353.67869112649
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?	10329.476077499692
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.	13681.454648701165
What system had proved more effective?	9368.575798655642
Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.	17932.61452774436
Example?	19456.598729469286
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.	11478.613363821949
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest ’ s parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?	16004.733258935226
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).	13630.736005553043
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?	13428.388305501187
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.	11675.767672887154
Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?	13837.25736969919
Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).	14519.81306852106
What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?	14012.9966158467
By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_ (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).	12688.258397223764
By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m ’ baad l ’ zamatejch_ (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).	12264.76864065046
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?	13839.403518020294
By juxtaposition.	7739.307484912719
On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, and <NUM>.	12613.261865609124
Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?	14350.831362718776
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.	16605.88437651341
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?	11388.355743292197
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar <NUM> years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S.	14797.677048206326
Mary ’ s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve ’ s tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.	14396.63647647096
Kolod balejwaw pnimah Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.	17356.98505688499
Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?	10233.049748306661
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?	9034.94468194814
By a periphrastic version of the general text.	10546.086090990108
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?	10095.751026046188
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).	12853.515090785982
Did the guest comply with his host ’ s request?	12364.926596945064
Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.	15774.614453244125
What was Stephen ’ s auditive sensation?	4984.995305519763
He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.	8041.837084939052
What was Bloom ’ s visual sensation?	5251.011831390456
He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.	10212.525244515451
What were Stephen ’ s and Bloom ’ s quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?	7164.62557212069
Visually, Stephen ’ s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.	13499.140158632166
What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?	11267.784244683447
In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.	6270.617896662603
J., the reverend T.	3247.370013186932
Salmon, D.	9395.946555050346
D., provost of Trinity college, Dr Alexander J.	7357.769117852724
Dowie.	19456.598729469286
At the bar, English or Irish: exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K.	9158.977784996367
C., Rufus Isaacs, K.	5421.370317537226
C.	957.8630399978279
On the stage, modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle († <NUM>), exponent of Shakespeare.	11418.731004732748
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?	13171.503610182659
Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.	16084.603913844257
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.	15633.247878003795
Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball.	14011.664614119649
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played He drove it o ’ er the jew ’ s garden wall.	7625.632913323189
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played He broke the jew ’ s windows all.	7260.373771367837
How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?	8402.657032664789
With unmixed feeling.	7000.233131095971
Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.	12409.032791334248
Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.	14469.37850351149
Then out there came the jew ’ s daughter And she all dressed in green.	8924.098482237569
“ Come back, come back, you pretty little boy, And play your ball again. ” I can ’ t come back and I won ’ t come back Without my schoolfellows all.	10446.96310310051
For if my master he did hear He ’ d make it a sorry ball. ” She took him by the lilywhite hand And led him along the hall Until she led him to a room Where none could hear him call.	13448.273544181493
She took a penknife out of her pocket And cut off his little head.	8530.4809204818
And now he ’ ll play his ball no more For he lies among the dead.	7741.461794655002
How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?	8402.424090464981
With mixed feelings.	8720.090461897724
Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew ’ s daughter, all dressed in green.	11254.509582069108
Condense Stephen ’ s commentary.	10872.96863319614
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined.	8652.835461219374
Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny.	13629.85967105362
It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting.	12405.963780813097
It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.	11880.031120403703
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?	8645.33368730331
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.	11840.117835023413
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?	9125.067114581261
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.	9241.514722340578
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?	8645.33368730331
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.	14762.215458141392
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?	13987.818873952816
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds.	10813.23316556564
From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.	13418.682776890004
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?	13495.553984403829
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of <NUM> and <NUM> years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.	14197.457290609324
What other infantile memories had he of her?	7464.083352841988
<NUM> June <NUM>.	4297.645639817102
A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion.	11270.910550139279
A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.	14075.242009500285
What endemic characteristics were present?	8152.751906279645
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.	15876.461304244185
What memories had he of her adolescence?	8447.909294438496
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess.	11175.995819292464
On the duke ’ s lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated).	11050.105132743161
On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated).	11480.693781253405
On the vigil of the <NUM> th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).	10010.647867876802
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?	11696.32350721397
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.	14508.010340349114
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly, if differently?	11278.90212101559
A temporary departure of his cat.	7743.256877556241
Why similarly, why differently?	9699.479519737977
Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.	16651.038186712194
In other respects were their differences similar?	10222.89784855025
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.	8232.166957639698
As?	3947.017453609157
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat).	12929.602573143435
Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen ’ s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat).	12718.820930426189
Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat).	13116.250939468347
Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.	11965.720551846698
In what way had he utilised gifts (<NUM>) an owl, <NUM>) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?	12714.50819376937
As object lessons to explain: <NUM>) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: <NUM>) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, <NUM> / <NUM> minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.	15179.588536245225
In what manners did she reciprocate?	8391.982572802948
She remembered: on the <NUM> th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.	10310.325508290241
She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires.	14157.291743926497
She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.	13578.72450618916
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?	11911.884909659278
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.	14907.742402876063
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation?	12356.811841271036
For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction.	10452.271199089957
For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.	11996.850597271467
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew ’ s daughter?	13565.747898786147
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.	9711.398667324218
To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?	13458.146849700757
If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, <NUM> October <NUM>.	10648.148379148086
What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?	11328.093810410282
A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), <NUM> June <NUM>, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).	10510.904694362589
Was the proposal of asylum accepted?	10957.541918475645
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.	16649.41233465726
What exchange of money took place between host and guest?	10140.242517290131
The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£ <NUM> <NUM>), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to the former.	12378.429492457328
What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?	13678.573175968668
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed.	10976.495207999962
To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress.	10699.20331935591
To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, <NUM> Lower Abbey street (W.	11286.504666714547
and E.	6272.116520541042
Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, <NUM> Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit).	11978.765005229414
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?	11949.573647920104
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler ’ s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown ’ s) papa.	13311.984732861016
The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of <NUM> he (Bloom) had marked a florin (<NUM> / -) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J.	11663.008692851552
and T.	5061.832814606934
Davy, family grocers, <NUM> Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.	14191.346224800083
Was the clown Bloom ’ s son?	5803.8867601587335
No. Had Bloom ’ s coin returned?	5725.544676093095
Never.	5667.633815772718
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?	10004.645054973673
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.	14872.819140083579
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?	11129.208973953122
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.	15306.550981918299
Why did he desist from speculation?	7391.709118119386
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.	12238.962800649031
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?	11300.144797980092
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?	9496.401211449816
Not verbally.	7341.9588068610365
Substantially.	19456.598729469286
What comforted his misapprehension?	7753.384680337188
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.	12981.147684078951
In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?	11203.878065415563
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by BLOOM Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by STEPHEN With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?	16868.91223106332
What did each do at the door of egress?	6012.855240960556
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor.	5951.78975726413
Stephen put the hat on his head.	4922.651239382681
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?	10144.4472834178
For a cat.	6094.204381699572
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?	13510.083565279063
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.	9027.282556419757
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?	12104.083154380025
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft <NUM> ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) <NUM> lightyears (<NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> miles) distant and in volume <NUM> times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which <NUM> of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in <NUM>: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	14573.519789982165
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?	13020.771772555354
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.	14977.676302085985
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?	9498.040752324492
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?	13063.173070737132
Of a different order of difficulty.	11452.164515710323
Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of <NUM> tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.	16123.575446684374
And the problem of possible redemption?	5684.997403284551
The minor was proved by the major.	8924.367346732444
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?	14696.462358503482
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the <NUM> th: their positions: the waggoner ’ s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S.	14423.557256293854
Lawrence (martyr, <NUM> August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (<NUM> st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (<NUM> nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.	13506.989663172424
His (Bloom ’ s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?	9309.092024283278
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman.	9503.04919898384
That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence.	13861.622191654598
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?	13493.606972045014
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.	15377.899576022264
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?	12933.913245545069
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.	13821.932849412458
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?	10350.678054730397
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.	16120.350417302374
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom ’ s, who attracted Stephen ’ s, gaze?	5895.255149904194
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom ’ s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O ’ Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, <NUM> Aungier street.	11198.100111125268
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?	12282.132592812606
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.	14544.729946288417
Both then were silent?	12269.751945584874
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.	16280.50817889051
Were they indefinitely inactive?	12818.243863230015
At Stephen ’ s suggestion, at Bloom ’ s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom ’ s, then Stephen ’ s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.	10685.375108249818
Similarly?	19456.598729469286
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom ’ s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School (<NUM>) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, <NUM> scholars: Stephen ’ s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.	13197.933783852177
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?	11323.778334955361
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.	13854.952337699191
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (<NUM> January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.	14542.165889509499
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?	10495.202034502441
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.	13859.570461075988
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?	10080.141732745498
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.	15232.844682136243
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?	7837.0296991519135
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.	14840.370255272826
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?	12573.372801213034
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.	9287.600888584582
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?	11657.62928306517
By Stephen: Liliata rutilantium.	8019.8336873917015
Turma circumdet.	12452.996386040257
Iubilantium te virginum.	9654.052904688688
By Bloom: Heigho, heigho, Heigho, heigho.	11212.386226276245
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?	13540.393905826322
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).	6845.1722970307055
Alone, what did Bloom hear?	12067.18955634089
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew ’ s harp in the resonant lane.	11310.96182253398
Alone, what did Bloom feel?	13159.264002854177
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.	13120.107436950178
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?	10730.28070701945
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F.	13575.125351562225
Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).	14711.682585632538
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?	10940.092131755886
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk.	11340.053419033222
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?	12997.42457360847
Once, in <NUM>, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.	11969.79002377145
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?	7082.104554410348
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.	14771.390523368402
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door.	10938.31246296254
With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.	12205.816832237844
What suddenly arrested his ingress?	7693.898555708834
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.	13702.46192036109
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture.	15787.601240253036
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	12814.579615654522
Describe them.	6450.791878154556
One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.	14912.251052595366
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.	14053.99893526377
What significances attached to these two chairs?	9978.756250126813
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.	16969.956503073096
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?	9445.096595523177
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies ’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_ (words by G.	14042.234913561384

With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?	11171.395694421779
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan ’ s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.	15281.386784985449
His next proceeding?	7402.72619810262
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.	14586.624593621415
What followed this operation?	6773.273691952053
The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.	12632.042216769096
What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?	11362.97243643585
What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?	10277.881641539965
In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl.	11075.674461922472
Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.	15049.56790044673
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?	9974.5890047164
The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.	7858.517821001591
Why solitary (ipsorelative)?	8290.572050152114
Brothers and sisters had he none.	14776.212419786312
Yet that man ’ s father was his grandfather ’ s son.	7346.975023027026
Why mutable (aliorelative)?	8290.572050152114
From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.	13130.25355978046
From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator.	13360.396381261295
What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?	9683.430909620198
The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite.	12200.563509407379

Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the lacerated ungual fragment.	14700.542983667518

What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?	11951.4579388314
A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality, of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown.	14274.131977496552
Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.	15787.36454820123

What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?	10997.615708552707
Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?	8935.321908193111
Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.	13024.943514691897
As?	3947.017453609157
The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.	14393.97799396739
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?	8196.27819650229
Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.	13441.140396033461
What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?	8430.087213877767
Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged <NUM>) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).	13990.233062366564
Leopold Bloom (aged <NUM>) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.	14669.698735454756
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?	13365.989514466899

What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?	11363.618063689644

What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?	10078.10897267221
The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.	10781.257409859836
What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?	10495.202039304339
The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.	11707.085779715771

With which attendant indignities?	9700.725359187118
The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing.	14074.740326834068
By what could such a situation be precluded?	11717.795827420861

Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?	13590.209674932024
Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events.	15229.294137387296
Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall.	15244.628570627629
Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king.	15090.39374308984
What would render such return irrational?	8465.559897211733

Bloom ’ s acts?	4577.942291377143
He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.	11297.693985107688
How?	2565.614153239221
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.	15320.195737948738
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?	9472.877695236677
New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.	14288.170267977506
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?	9170.460218476092
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.	14234.61148496232
What preceding series?	6664.202189317685
Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d ’ Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society ’ s Horse Show, Maggot O ’ Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E.	13732.266994745083
(Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to no last term.	13091.31974960414
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).	14712.565542329747
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?	12748.095769008205
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.	13789.209315497683
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?	11184.769642647532
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.	16683.070574734196
Envy?	16997.075953601572
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.	15100.531712313403
Jealousy?	19456.598729469286
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction.	14689.044877970558
Because attraction between agent (s) and reagent (s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance.	15008.91163669803
Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.	12243.26845366181
Abnegation?	19456.598729469286
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September <NUM> in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, <NUM> Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.	15439.67996448792
Equanimity?	19456.598729469286
As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.	14836.651935009128
As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun.	11210.918307975062
As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king ’ s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder.	15454.88607220885
As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease.	15048.185677251167
As more than inevitable, irreparable.	11489.737016233137
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?	12111.38890443038
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.	14536.725904082323
What retribution, if any?	8641.469665117509
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right.	13646.855756223615
Duel by combat, no.	10377.641979662263
Divorce, not now.	9413.986176303628
Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet.	14841.307559320298
Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly.	16592.928740826548
Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly.	17570.71474456905
If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both.	14641.040502963395
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?	13569.94253590026
The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.	14724.489457906564
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?	11690.519344172091
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.	14798.79280589639
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?	6282.8434293085
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.	13689.569280446207
Then?	4857.75342159322
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.	13522.246941501195
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?	6282.8434293085
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.	12310.803266595867
What followed this silent action?	6968.576106810172
Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.	17116.052074792657

Absolutely.	16997.075953601572

By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, <NUM> September <NUM>, there remained a period of <NUM> months and <NUM> day during which, in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.	13558.33129010442
How?	2565.614153239221
By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.	13137.183327232347
What moved visibly above the listener ’ s and the narrator ’ s invisible thoughts?	10522.683339789355

• Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out <NUM> d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water <NUM> woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters <NUM> per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come <NUM> or <NUM> times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out <NUM> kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ <NUM> for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die <NUM> times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered <NUM> teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea <NUM> days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give <NUM> points in <NUM> to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was <NUM> times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the <NUM> big poppies because mine was the <NUM> th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was <NUM> after <NUM> when I saw the <NUM> Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the <NUM> th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the <NUM> rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a <NUM> st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him <NUM> or <NUM> tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G <NUM> th Bn <NUM> nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the <NUM> acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the <NUM> th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <NUM> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <NUM> obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about <NUM> / - in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <NUM> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <NUM> years more I have of life up to <NUM> no Im what am I at all Ill be <NUM> in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street <NUM> st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she <NUM> there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a — e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page <NUM> the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made <NUM> the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was <NUM> of the <NUM> wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into <NUM> of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that <NUM> the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no <NUM> with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the <NUM> nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about <NUM> minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W C I ’ ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their <NUM> Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have

affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the <NUM> things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the <NUM> of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near <NUM> or a <NUM> her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because <NUM> drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing <NUM> times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in <NUM> years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly <NUM> years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about <NUM> perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure <NUM> carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that

damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were <NUM> of us goodbye to my sleep for this

wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those <NUM> lb pots of mixed plum and

and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats <NUM> consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news <NUM> years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <NUM> shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in <NUM> halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what <NUM> or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at <NUM> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her <NUM> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us <NUM> days every <NUM> or <NUM> weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced <NUM> times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about <NUM> weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself <NUM> and <NUM> times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about <NUM> minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very <NUM> st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after <NUM> years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our <NUM> sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait <NUM> quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their <NUM> pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and <NUM> children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying <NUM> / - in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats <NUM> years ago now yes hed be <NUM> though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the <NUM> th card after that the <NUM> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the <NUM> queens and the <NUM> of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and <NUM> red <NUM> s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait <NUM> I was married <NUM> Milly is <NUM> yesterday <NUM> what age was he then at Dillons <NUM> or <NUM> about <NUM> I suppose hes <NUM> or more Im not too old for him if hes <NUM> or <NUM> I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in <NUM> a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from <NUM> years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the <NUM> st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <NUM> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a <NUM> nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent <NUM> atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same <NUM> lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <NUM> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <NUM> s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our <NUM> st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <NUM> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for <NUM> he can make it for <NUM> Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only <NUM> or <NUM> Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the <NUM> st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him <NUM> or <NUM> times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue <NUM> miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ <NUM> or perhaps <NUM> / - Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent <NUM> or <NUM> questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day

couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes <NUM> years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas <NUM> glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.	14280.860020802513
