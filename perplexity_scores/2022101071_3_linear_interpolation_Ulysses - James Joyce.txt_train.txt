16.320298268501354
Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	13.979694561157835
A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air.	12.233436341829913
He held the bowl aloft and intoned: — _Introibo ad altare Dei_.	8.630089188266641
Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: — Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit! Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.	15.308262949435372
He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains.	12.042155171002543
Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head.	15.121575831214503
Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.	12.894967197233306
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.	14.97753446858691
— Back to barracks! he said sternly.	15.326153091526727
He added in a preacher ’ s tone: — For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns.	14.087297134586546
Slow music, please.	19.313051190116134
Shut your eyes, gents.	18.931211228889683
One moment.	18.873060726839974
Silence, all.	25.585172461878134
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points.	12.815616488328955
Chrysostomos.	49.9750299142878
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.	12.462598913215322
That will do nicely.	15.598341630291191
Switch off the current, will you?	16.498515975540062
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown.	13.008496117805946
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.	8.12535335471558
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.	11.364908389088912
— The mockery of it! he said gaily.	18.713580280299503
Your absurd name, an ancient Greek! He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself.	14.595177522685415
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.	12.823711798686487
Buck Mulligan ’ s gay voice went on.	15.04467077508603
— My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.	14.865194640793687
But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn ’ t it?	11.233922864008964
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.	15.637369655528522
We must go to Athens.	18.90768825205146
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?	12.293970249911107
He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried: — Will he come?	17.65563461545827
The jejune jesuit! Ceasing, he began to shave with care.	11.896819433384874
— Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.	21.364841060454662
— Yes, my love?	20.12583808594489
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.	12.201914064557029
— God, isn ’ t he dreadful?	15.839191227287255
he said frankly.	24.30531056591796
A ponderous Saxon.	15.659230345746534
He thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	17.885238559866444
God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion.	9.344683630719471
Because he comes from Oxford.	17.42090944341555
You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner.	21.935151189849716
He can ’ t make you out.	20.49624692949448
O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife - blade.	22.961698776569694
He shaved warily over his chin.	14.5930893588
— He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.	12.69908042277061
Where is his guncase?	18.37502491435108
— A woful lunatic! Mulligan said.	8.70232221896693
Were you in a funk?	28.157802399450716
— I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.	12.11994235697318
Out here in the dark with a man I don ’ t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther.	13.919546430179235
I ’ m not a hero, however.	12.782582151689189
If he stays on here I am off.	15.00702004927765
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.	18.98645528704957
He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.	10.108219794166342
— Scutter! he cried thickly.	14.60175791139089
He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen ’ s upper pocket, said: — Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.	14.321761612741772
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief.	15.170937439412226
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.	9.269082692715898
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said: — The bard ’ s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.	14.6645980437563
You can almost taste it, can ’ t you?	16.69264867548733
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.	13.701203045228345
— God! he said quietly.	19.112401978575217
Isn ’ t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother?	16.116925287800818
The snotgreen sea.	15.136707290387303
_Epi oinopa ponton_.	14.727752224018444
Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you.	25.09704830347051
You must read them in the original.	21.48480153566735
_Thalatta! Thalatta! _ She is our great sweet mother.	14.530529021872715
Come and look.	21.853116365518595
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.	21.828278593089063
Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.	16.313983587536054
— Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.	10.120559113006511
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen ’ s face.	13.708449363923638
— The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.	10.283453811575736
That ’ s why she won ’ t let me have anything to do with you.	14.050219905064024
— Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.	18.28809628844348
— You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said.	14.993849888614271
I ’ m hyperborean as much as you.	11.64651955377482
But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her.	15.108584592416138
And you refused.	15.770218951104019
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.	9.101100232822535
A tolerant smile curled his lips.	9.31831244089386
— But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself.	14.178507613815992
Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all! He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.	19.381209868545383
Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat - sleeve.	12.836200324885398
Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.	15.608500207160027
Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	13.01677860187281
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.	12.152438987766814
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.	9.76773746409754
A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.	8.781679893222101
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.	11.019919051222201
— Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice.	18.859907324751703
I must give you a shirt and a few noserags.	21.95127223644809
How are the secondhand breeks?	13.998176015681034
— They fit well enough, Stephen answered.	12.886527426530185
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.	9.285585773347702
— The mockery of it, he said contentedly.	16.394514967740438
Secondleg they should be.	18.70743783469116
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey.	16.186469684199803
You ’ ll look spiffing in them.	12.169778151685025
I ’ m not joking, Kinch.	9.23588900772442
You look damn well when you ’ re dressed.	16.575946404705785
— Thanks, Stephen said.	12.233514662967035
I can ’ t wear them if they are grey.	16.057350449420273
— He can ’ t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.	18.62004362987575
Etiquette is etiquette.	15.828654358328418
He kills his mother but he can ’ t wear grey trousers.	16.13512627041989
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes.	17.342421670300276
— That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g.	22.396404530559067
p.	29.301740525294186
i.	52.24873921370521
He ’ s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.	10.49296103933006
General paralysis of the insane! He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.	12.909199294884917
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.	15.197293529072802
Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.	11.732133141731156
— Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack.	16.508313006030967
Hair on end.	18.805068519718862
As he and others see me.	16.956272683857346
Who chose this face for me?	15.430010537237107
This dogsbody to rid of vermin.	10.728694242579113
It asks me too.	15.939268268686533
— I pinched it out of the skivvy ’ s room, Buck Mulligan said.	13.905465317447318
It does her all right.	14.250664845481467
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.	7.701008129701174
Lead him not into temptation.	14.80987042593671
And her name is Ursula.	18.921877915933376
Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen ’ s peering eyes.	23.928282067955266
— The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.	11.622350187075991
If Wilde were only alive to see you! Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness: — It is a symbol of Irish art.	14.186368107320243
The cracked lookingglass of a servant.	16.266452336484452
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen ’ s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.	16.12744184334515
— It ’ s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?	14.416972959059121
he said kindly.	20.926187926147836
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.	16.94662593833431
Parried again.	23.103047917431436
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.	14.940825707166512
The cold steel pen.	15.116263882239311
— Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea.	13.51510681977289
He ’ s stinking with money and thinks you ’ re not a gentleman.	13.517430459380291
His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.	8.927017836541198
God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island.	19.982954340619308
Hellenise it.	23.98937307525098
Cranly ’ s arm.	26.89723078870967
His arm.	22.17120140062211
— And to think of your having to beg from these swine.	12.604813826477503
I ’ m the only one that knows what you are.	16.795108815421155
Why don ’ t you trust me more?	14.83694631273398
What have you up your nose against me?	16.40870079870132
Is it Haines?	19.822619538464533
If he makes any noise here I ’ ll bring down Seymour and we ’ ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.	10.511636262051619
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe ’ s rooms.	10.097122015035321
Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.	12.409988521883944
O, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor ’ s shears.	12.156749159735318
A scared calf ’ s face gilded with marmalade.	12.126404078510776
I don ’ t want to be debagged! Don ’ t you play the giddy ox with me! Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.	12.075261620831872
A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold ’ s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.	7.1768455047949
To ourselves...	16.53809176373657
new paganism...	11.160943704863358
omphalos.	44.876532221709276
— Let him stay, Stephen said.	10.184742219391916
There ’ s nothing wrong with him except at night.	15.278405300675304
— Then what is it?	14.685004543654722
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.	12.517963929802908
Cough it up.	19.65988247106297
I ’ m quite frank with you.	9.844146896138584
What have you against me now?	18.882948226435236
They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.	14.348121432818107
Stephen freed his arm quietly.	16.415932334471382
— Do you wish me to tell you?	18.20110939021128
he asked.	10.295735601437203
— Yes, what is it?	14.113297738048002
I don ’ t remember anything.	11.305202399568227
He looked in Stephen ’ s face as he spoke.	19.282060189550204
A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.	8.394191290489456
Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said: — Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother ’ s death?	20.325090028107763
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: — What?	14.217741829001788
Where?	20.307631490117476
I can ’ t remember anything.	13.83585830324736
I remember only ideas and sensations.	11.509284506153318
Why?	18.457368458488407
What happened in the name of God?	27.23299488165575
— You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water.	16.363681586315003
She asked you who was in your room.	27.02130926309442
— Yes?	16.620972851440886
Buck Mulligan said.	8.558790832424284
What did I say?	23.210050312816566
I forget.	26.925599499417295
— You said, Stephen answered, _O, it ’ s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly <URL> A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan ’ s cheek.	11.513224131358704
— Did I say that?	21.54196648793237
he asked.	10.295735601437203
Well?	29.103223780398952
What harm is that?	16.59408744238507
He shook his constraint from him nervously.	12.26770269675436
— And what is death, he asked, your mother ’ s or yours or my own?	19.20743803131296
You saw only your mother die.	14.258845835936635
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.	13.625805029965226
It ’ s a beastly thing and nothing else.	12.415005993932477
It simply doesn ’ t matter.	17.296052684012565
You wouldn ’ t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.	18.3076145278088
Why?	18.457368458488407
To me it ’ s all a mockery and beastly.	15.005067427877972
Her cerebral lobes are not functioning.	12.19085462970013
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt.	8.956850387355837
Humour her till it ’ s over.	20.13070297639869
You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don ’ t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette ’ s.	9.144033483975562
Absurd! I suppose I did say it.	23.511306987656273
I didn ’ t mean to offend the memory of your mother.	11.927014274613969
He had spoken himself into boldness.	10.696562758173659
Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly: — I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.	17.855225346332524
— Of what then?	16.39709297095636
Buck Mulligan asked.	12.84474101419548
— Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.	15.16422604676233
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.	17.429186744814157
— O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.	15.288316443106048
He walked off quickly round the parapet.	14.718756707663058
Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.	16.597749954670824
Sea and headland now grew dim.	10.20357975476581
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.	17.205892286469375
A voice within the tower called loudly: — Are you up there, Mulligan?	18.90668513660544
— I ’ m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.	11.161577538315719
He turned towards Stephen and said: — Look at the sea.	17.541299595808688
What does it care about offences?	13.643442703426294
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.	9.275675385182414
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof: — Don ’ t mope over it all day, he said.	18.015233402842224
I ’ m inconsequent.	12.813178593392559
Give up the moody brooding.	17.709813273414458
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead: And no more turn aside and brood Upon love ’ s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars.	10.321942754717005
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed.	15.626231444032415
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.	9.77408222029839
White breast of the dim sea.	25.25838204340216
The twining stresses, two by two.	12.017386818951437
A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords.	6.108260117619654
Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.	14.73847277369526
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green.	8.905353602986628
It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.	17.43317741978546
Fergus ’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.	18.756162594047886
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.	15.931069723824804
Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside.	15.999440663854275
She was crying in her wretched bed.	15.748849042652143
For those words, Stephen: love ’ s bitter mystery.	21.09166042927427
Where now?	25.26937185592541
Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.	7.185254252859577
She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang: I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility.	10.914445954654726
Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.	10.11288386825051
And no more turn aside and brood.	11.548617305112623
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys.	24.184047854468652
Memories beset his brooding brain.	8.950616376286273
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament.	18.54871688703479
A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.	12.481186795534779
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children ’ s shirts.	16.099121433065918
In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	11.171238357613907
Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.	17.210558045444216
On me alone.	18.36418685354395
The ghostcandle to light her agony.	10.395413047930536
Ghostly light on the tortured face.	20.151714937009242
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees.	9.936658143389055
Her eyes on me to strike me down.	21.266790598304322
_Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus <URL> Ghoul! Chewer of corpses! No, mother! Let me be and let me live.	7.506587390987159
— Kinch ahoy! Buck Mulligan ’ s voice sang from within the tower.	11.558401471882814
It came nearer up the staircase, calling again.	14.423517900903432
Stephen, still trembling at his soul ’ s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.	16.807250197856064
— Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.	27.113961532477692
Breakfast is ready.	16.2712961687787
Haines is apologising for waking us last night.	8.700530793295071
It ’ s all right.	10.708282539726643
— I ’ m coming, Stephen said, turning.	13.159651706227626
— Do, for Jesus ’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.	10.864934512276337
For my sake and for all our sakes.	17.40074546567325
His head disappeared and reappeared.	11.297504636347984
— I told him your symbol of Irish art.	11.322523457102905
He says it ’ s very clever.	17.869992313510448
Touch him for a quid, will you?	18.438829387105994
A guinea, I mean.	21.715951361278318
— I get paid this morning, Stephen said.	12.202435216347737
— The school kip?	14.550140971167373
Buck Mulligan said.	8.558790832424284
How much?	20.18279754523966
Four quid?	25.37747567922081
Lend us one.	22.088837259506143
— If you want it, Stephen said.	15.154895325641782
— Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight.	9.585646156978257
We ’ ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.	9.2313905581147
Four omnipotent sovereigns.	12.978488278162482
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent: O, won ’ t we have a merry time, Drinking whisky, beer and wine! On coronation, Coronation day! O, won ’ t we have a merry time On coronation day! Warm sunshine merrying over the sea.	10.781686461462769
The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet.	11.954243527115839
Why should I bring it down?	19.231407007503755
Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?	18.06053318647447
He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.	14.79160263781954
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.	11.7243122749049
I am another now and yet the same.	15.804106309360314
A server of a servant.	21.337053363197228
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan ’ s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow.	10.072725846997987
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.	10.672512976501272
— We ’ ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.	8.914798955283679
Haines, open that door, will you?	13.339255983542298
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.	18.589821003864937
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.	16.031811649854625
— Have you the key?	16.616823775425246
a voice asked.	13.066342360709614
— Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.	13.433447654760887
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.	11.019349287273188
Haines stood at the doorway, looking out.	22.90958446067056
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait.	12.67157977581996
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him.	14.077993552142996
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.	12.924466965971188
— I ’ m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...	12.446277393257555
But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.	10.96863141175079
Haines, come in.	22.08337786813455
The grub is ready.	12.133098283384555
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.	25.89637023393284
Where ’ s the sugar?	19.227371345267986
O, jay, there ’ s no milk.	15.762323745544709
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker.	18.669676516357175
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.	19.53404985733609
— What sort of a kip is this?	18.046631208366538
I told her to come after eight.	19.0157718880358
— We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.	14.080891864588876
There ’ s a lemon in the locker.	20.399041612935314
— O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said.	9.35422830989332
I want Sandycove milk.	14.769128935795091
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly: — That woman is coming up with the milk.	26.159718693701404
— The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair.	16.387758403051865
Sit down.	21.507556719591214
Pour out the tea there.	22.656021284963206
The sugar is in the bag.	25.34843854679917
Here, I can ’ t go fumbling at the damned eggs.	19.04299886964331
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying: — _In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus <URL> Haines sat down to pour out the tea.	10.672689155153597
— I ’ m giving you two lumps each, he said.	9.683544452096598
But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don ’ t you?	18.54697068321627
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman ’ s wheedling voice: — When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.	15.113786168390357
And when I makes water I makes water.	14.196725250838872
— By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.	15.110131635957993
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: — _So I do, Mrs Cahill, _ says she.	13.305475586695803
_Begob, ma ’ am, _ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don ’ t make them in the one <URL> He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.	11.081805447120908
— That ’ s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines.	17.34820147644045
Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum.	12.349275779944822
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.	25.513553671739484
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows: — Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan ’ s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?	16.716120064873085
— I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.	19.102066284159097
— Do you now?	15.539348259080198
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.	19.54928349798047
Your reasons, pray?	19.44445691556878
— I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion.	18.9916284048854
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.	18.665965557088917
Buck Mulligan ’ s face smiled with delight.	13.753494349730166
— Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly.	14.418040141375654
Do you think she was?	24.018818695006757
Quite charming! Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: _ — For old Mary Ann She doesn ’ t care a damn.	13.781860610926541
But, hising up her petticoats... _ He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.	11.137020779119332
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.	11.408155964317027
— The milk, sir! — Come in, ma ’ am, Mulligan said.	15.760734470533686
Kinch, get the jug.	27.87488980188065
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen ’ s elbow.	20.19226429129312
— That ’ s a lovely morning, sir, she said.	12.495724073102744
Glory be to God.	17.326944624741287
— To whom?	20.573225790931133
Mulligan said, glancing at her.	23.139614386901073
Ah, to be sure! Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.	17.533133426907543
— How much, sir?	17.302986861734567
asked the old woman.	28.590658928882245
— A quart, Stephen said.	11.39073155971982
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers.	13.39123938227649
Old shrunken paps.	14.392161089803704
She poured again a measureful and a tilly.	13.366821354885888
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger.	13.306611104836161
She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.	17.1888649995055
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.	15.530154691910434
They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.	10.96500847565767
Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times.	17.91184006898536
A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.	11.723197032534488
To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.	10.77225937428272
— It is indeed, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.	11.461550469985294
— Taste it, sir, she said.	16.086424750103113
He drank at her bidding.	17.95413672794467
— If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn ’ t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.	14.578190252782663
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives ’ spits.	9.178556051294846
— Are you a medical student, sir?	13.191239973129342
the old woman asked.	16.394162159156036
— I am, ma ’ am, Buck Mulligan answered.	9.952551749951356
— Look at that now, she said.	18.537678482854297
Stephen listened in scornful silence.	11.461266199882681
She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights.	14.866799546972139
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.	11.91240488252604
— Do you understand what he says?	19.91625447361083
Stephen asked her.	21.165983947181864
— Is it French you are talking, sir?	13.392085496971971
the old woman said to Haines.	17.46600654055417
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.	16.219466836384036
— Irish, Buck Mulligan said.	12.151882534375023
Is there Gaelic on you?	15.685059757039856
— I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.	20.98248484892457
Are you from the west, sir?	24.29893880418481
— I am an Englishman, Haines answered.	12.93665928020442
— He ’ s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.	14.314752621468264
I ’ m told it ’ s a grand language by them that knows.	14.183981607307988
— Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.	21.172552825359872
Wonderful entirely.	23.29436342681128
Fill us out some more tea, Kinch.	15.325404979724073
Would you like a cup, ma ’ am?	15.88068436317162
— No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.	18.203047506730233
Haines said to her: — Have you your bill?	26.132159747182495
We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn ’ t we?	17.063280566121172
Stephen filled again the three cups.	17.626198279846598
— Bill, sir?	15.756626405896004
she said, halting.	22.140539532139034
Well, it ’ s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling.	9.5110781647745
That ’ s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.	14.662254678004366
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.	10.961573237764949
— Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.	17.070375033835646
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk.	11.94364479363707
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried: — A miracle! He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying: — Ask nothing more of me, sweet.	17.91588483929549
All I can give you I give.	21.786067532760587
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.	16.11757634914084
— We ’ ll owe twopence, he said.	10.300310124946613
— Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.	18.059485973154988
Time enough.	18.922239652063745
Good morning, sir.	12.660183753446205
She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan ’ s tender chant: _ — Heart of my heart, were it more, More would be laid at your <URL> He turned to Stephen and said: — Seriously, Dedalus.	16.595641718560895
I ’ m stony.	13.35308666921058
Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money.	13.407440643283442
Today the bards must drink and junket.	10.159045191217178
Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.	13.480047797747954
— That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.	16.58229630408631
— Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.	10.42677080114729
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: — Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?	14.411712393740764
Then he said to Haines: — The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.	13.956057533725554
— All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.	15.532552028143888
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke: — I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.	16.612016500815223
Speaking to me.	18.734562283063898
They wash and tub and scrub.	10.771971254581722
Agenbite of inwit.	12.232923880133509
Conscience.	49.9750299142878
Yet here ’ s a spot.	21.18640621508725
— That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.	11.93032465879395
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen ’ s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone: — Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.	17.567305030177085
— Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.	19.3062250167504
I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.	17.403018680614295
— Would I make any money by it?	11.606180044829221
Stephen asked.	15.442182356790978
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said: — I don ’ t know, I ’ m sure.	17.647825816235247
He strolled out to the doorway.	21.209887492708457
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour: — You put your hoof in it now.	13.689470371596835
— Well?	18.550299025902348
Stephen said.	12.163642004899454
The problem is to get money.	23.207510523814374
From whom?	25.544781566582984
From the milkwoman or from him.	11.583959546214388
It ’ s a toss up, I think.	15.030037363581092
— I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.	13.07377477619766
— I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.	17.382964133275653
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen ’ s arm.	13.306977089181691
— From me, Kinch, he said.	17.39557727001819
In a suddenly changed tone he added: — To tell you the God ’ s truth I think you ’ re right.	15.743360672310114
Damn all else they are good for.	18.572493709301295
Why don ’ t you play them as I do?	18.671794961443677
To hell with them all.	17.180694099784635
Let us get out of the kip.	21.86967051756366
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly: — Mulligan is stripped of his garments.	13.904636038156735
He emptied his pockets on to the table.	14.866720229150028
— There ’ s your snotrag, he said.	10.176166460483106
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.	15.747257407601076
God, we ’ ll simply have to dress the character.	16.497179376118186
I want puce gloves and green boots.	12.44894391351939
Contradiction.	44.876532221709276
Do I contradict myself?	13.183912327309645
Very well then, I contradict myself.	22.38211030292243
Mercurial Malachi.	27.380052110867236
A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.	13.041923810774307
— And there ’ s your Latin quarter hat, he said.	12.85220394111609
Stephen picked it up and put it on.	22.900586473973483
Haines called to them from the doorway: — Are you coming, you fellows?	26.682883005306703
— I ’ m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.	12.667006734924138
Come out, Kinch.	24.95838548981666
You have eaten all we left, I suppose.	14.393728490713187
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow: — And going forth he met Butterly.	11.05936214814135
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it.	16.105945600700224
He put the huge key in his inner pocket.	17.83870576320848
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked: — Did you bring the key?	18.287332753525618
— I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.	16.42615579250746
He walked on.	14.557967549932993
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.	11.547390992423269
— Down, sir! How dare you, sir! Haines asked: — Do you pay rent for this tower?	15.907097555706677
— Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.	9.262225719038334
— To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.	11.81139364523753
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last: — Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.	12.517103187278463
Martello you call it?	20.83546641967682
— Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea.	12.764138049024401
But ours is the _omphalos_.	19.634929648676053
— What is your idea of Hamlet?	14.039198164454206
Haines asked Stephen.	20.18119824529594
— No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.	12.656568553148942
I ’ m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up.	11.698793347833444
Wait till I have a few pints in me first.	18.221942190024855
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat: — You couldn ’ t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?	13.976907159259817
— It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.	13.90449304448476
— You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.	9.526019868251636
Is it some paradox?	16.323128648865588
— Pooh! Buck Mulligan said.	9.448446119250821
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.	15.266536731775929
It ’ s quite simple.	15.224307800038115
He proves by algebra that Hamlet ’ s grandson is Shakespeare ’ s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.	15.196307353138806
— What?	11.778589598318154
Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen.	20.418841624111888
He himself?	24.6437416675659
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen ’ s ear: — O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father! — We ’ re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines.	13.554259229480527
And it is rather long to tell.	20.142807570164123
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.	15.451907181329517
— The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.	7.712752350740641
— I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore.	12.936900668261627
_That beetles o ’ er his base into the sea, _ isn ’ t it?	13.2202992823893
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak.	13.515202503107428
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.	9.84007055231527
— It ’ s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.	12.810322617734984
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.	10.104474334550911
The seas ’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.	16.336718614813346
— I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.	15.781605608439051
The Father and the Son idea.	23.72204511798915
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.	18.71908899091377
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.	13.438115774876346
He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.	11.679406916614477
He moved a doll ’ s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: _ — I ’ m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.	15.016013669884313
My mother ’ s a jew, my father ’ s a bird.	21.35197829333903
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.	10.560507367275324
So here ’ s to disciples and <URL> He held up a forefinger of warning.	15.012765982087732
_ — If anyone thinks that I amn ’ t divine He ’ ll get no free drinks when I ’ m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water <URL> He tugged swiftly at Stephen ’ s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: _ — Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.	13.485617739403564
What ’ s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet ’ s breezy...	13.31793906346112
Goodbye, now, goodbye! _ He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury ’ s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.	11.085228297684445
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said: — We oughtn ’ t to laugh, I suppose.	14.959796577664758
He ’ s rather blasphemous.	13.359975986031216
I ’ m not a believer myself, that is to say.	13.502334993605318
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn ’ t it?	11.031277189090629
What did he call it?	18.421806296760185
Joseph the Joiner?	18.72623826718161
— The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.	11.387147023367469
— O, Haines said, you have heard it before?	20.759636445238602
— Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.	16.463585016619795
— You ’ re not a believer, are you?	12.258435605376357
Haines asked.	20.69713339943103
I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word.	23.294253458280892
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.	13.315497825117955
— There ’ s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.	16.381978199652174
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone.	12.84062403240081
— Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.	15.542682526215264
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to.	16.174173764384932
He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.	13.89973515565475
— Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.	15.432440697741068
Either you believe or you don ’ t, isn ’ t it?	11.626087922840753
Personally I couldn ’ t stomach that idea of a personal God.	16.76119631830551
You don ’ t stand for that, I suppose?	21.75672320359162
— You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.	12.723196054368968
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side.	19.40533635100701
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.	13.723943398098312
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path.	14.564900591831373
They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.	18.226617823049704
He wants that key.	13.465000078041847
It is mine.	17.782240072535828
I paid the rent.	15.236854604846005
Now I eat his salt bread.	11.445924384482879
Give him the key too.	20.03364039343577
All.	22.97709427972042
He will ask for it.	15.00227731541459
That was in his eyes.	20.805154268730256
— After all, Haines began...	16.275788228718344
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.	17.909124956307927
— After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.	18.23092570802538
You are your own master, it seems to me.	15.802155957672841
— I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.	15.897368442857363
— Italian?	20.848228720228715
Haines said.	16.266718097894255
A crazy queen, old and jealous.	15.967495665401973
Kneel down before me.	15.435759257310384
— And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	15.042652411503004
— Italian?	20.848228720228715
Haines said again.	22.076293632122468
What do you mean?	17.748199647002345
— The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.	14.14417345831064
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.	11.458061949970292
— I can quite understand that, he said calmly.	16.319037080074146
An Irishman must think like that, I daresay.	18.560093195245855
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly.	10.28989708572639
It seems history is to blame.	13.371234704413947
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen ’ s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam: _ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars.	7.454288510513936
Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.	11.247913430347324
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ ’ s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.	10.997065396063155
Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.	15.168464058172704
Idle mockery.	23.142614876728047
The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael ’ s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.	13.974887888132372
Hear, hear! Prolonged applause.	8.888600292460449
_Zut! Nom de Dieu! _ — Of course I ’ m a Britisher, Haines ’ s voice said, and I feel as one.	17.048300807036053
I don ’ t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.	11.96944776003151
That ’ s our national problem, I ’ m afraid, just now.	12.216573226355914
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.	13.28214871468047
— She ’ s making for Bullock harbour.	14.370404595913387
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.	19.148396580949406
— There ’ s five fathoms out there, he said.	11.448012726475884
It ’ ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one.	14.094618901939068
It ’ s nine days today.	13.95510324042163
The man that was drowned.	19.46800978497412
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite.	12.069971714837912
Here I am.	23.386955894598078
They followed the winding path down to the creek.	17.668888294282514
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.	13.861512168924863
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.	14.958907117490641
— Is the brother with you, Malachi?	18.43630225399651
— Down in Westmeath.	13.475027998955794
With the Bannons.	14.808809452522627
— Still there?	19.932117721574514
I got a card from Bannon.	18.44202437481847
Says he found a sweet young thing down there.	13.80717659975723
Photo girl he calls her.	16.76648835592544
— Snapshot, eh?	11.646874289990064
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots.	11.46545270053482
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face.	9.153382955588492
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.	12.893674670176042
Chucked medicine and going in for the army.	19.968321255252306
— Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.	14.91513922096771
— Going over next week to stew.	9.742674695547686
You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?	12.589170001403831
— Yes.	10.060020338761374
— Spooning with him last night on the pier.	22.805811771995984
The father is rotto with money.	11.600753362366843
— Is she up the pole?	17.586095107108434
— Better ask Seymour that.	11.399153044096934
— Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.	8.242268574597912
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely: — Redheaded women buck like goats.	15.423047143274
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.	13.380556206599712
— My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.	13.671155529371147
I ’ m the <URL> Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.	16.66375857494273
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.	17.41740709185499
— Are you going in here, Malachi?	15.583556301613669
— Yes.	10.060020338761374
Make room in the bed.	23.686112612887758
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.	13.078245090167332
Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.	20.66701305781022
— Are you not coming in?	15.17308943219627
Buck Mulligan asked.	12.84474101419548
— Later on, Haines said.	16.012974923146952
Not on my breakfast.	21.27800154341158
Stephen turned away.	20.97754417539663
— I ’ m going, Mulligan, he said.	11.153778223443446
Stephen handed him the key.	20.66671241508909
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.	10.4770764647474
— And twopence, he said, for a pint.	19.07334064888815
Throw it there.	21.32504402386954
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.	18.429244551332374
Dressing, undressing.	15.639055273792371
Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly: — He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord.	19.304792715854244
Thus spake Zarathustra.	14.908141172838196
His plump body plunged.	13.006365893972802
— We ’ ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.	13.431559755009962
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.	23.621532678599362
Half twelve.	24.132187601688535
— Good, Stephen said.	11.8165636876997
He walked along the upwardcurving path.	11.826049273162258
Liliata rutilantium.	22.12600068161803
Turma circumdet.	17.534712543823726
Iubilantium te virginum.	11.41996657713615
The priest ’ s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly.	14.629552426177222
I will not sleep here tonight.	12.140658279333506
Home also I cannot go.	14.156826400415495
Turning the curve he waved his hand.	10.458904895655813
It called again.	16.973737479819995
A sleek brown head, a seal ’ s, far out on the water, round.	21.4368671725121
Usurper.	44.876532221709276
— You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?	13.31653079189337
— Tarentum, sir.	11.753087221863588
— Very good.	15.015458183738808
Well?	29.103223780398952
— There was a battle, sir.	13.951312214166672
— Very good.	15.015458183738808
Where?	20.307631490117476
The boy ’ s blank face asked the blank window.	14.776443873314292
Fabled by the daughters of memory.	21.513079389557856
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it.	15.507157377570362
A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake ’ s wings of excess.	13.762044563800732
I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame.	9.24392822459601
What ’ s left us then?	17.63313674276479
— I forget the place, sir.	17.02311724308965
<NUM> B.	21.30122576512673
C.	14.373100099742409
— Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book.	17.29188985859436
— Yes, sir.	7.883810949841353
And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done <URL> That phrase the world had remembered.	13.120979461496802
A dull ease of the mind.	20.481267235086193
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear.	9.823024158420216
Any general to any officers.	15.561415663769163
They lend ear.	16.446806780329137
— You, Armstrong, Stephen said.	8.764707130385487
What was the end of Pyrrhus?	22.18489024884034
— End of Pyrrhus, sir?	13.18700832168327
— I know, sir.	13.479959231865365
Ask me, sir, Comyn said.	17.16606755432449
— Wait.	17.19270834021654
You, Armstrong.	14.577658528358391
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?	13.406153048707566
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong ’ s satchel.	10.915598543657236
He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly.	9.133424938936203
Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips.	22.53577544848353
A sweetened boy ’ s breath.	19.250536869267645
Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy.	15.60493064212249
Vico Road, Dalkey.	12.52901962662583
— Pyrrhus, sir?	17.103692652367325
Pyrrhus, a pier.	38.837322525483444
All laughed.	23.62221117542772
Mirthless high malicious laughter.	11.48374098808267
Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile.	10.800493399263667
In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.	11.810600705883592
— Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy ’ s shoulder with the book, what is a pier.	22.390517537257796
— A pier, sir, Armstrong said.	13.517705967496434
A thing out in the water.	24.473419746364023
A kind of a bridge.	26.484220731028458
Kingstown pier, sir.	14.673956148222723
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning.	12.96003516187002
Two in the back bench whispered.	24.582998526103687
Yes.	14.82237916275066
They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.	11.319927381631233
All.	22.97709427972042
With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily.	8.434460148172017
Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle.	12.209802759279997
— Kingstown pier, Stephen said.	11.075596533969525
Yes, a disappointed bridge.	19.338964925605058
The words troubled their gaze.	11.672588479263355
— How, sir?	13.991480610491235
Comyn asked.	24.83059017341367
A bridge is across a river.	12.36146719726482
For Haines ’ s chapbook.	26.87187426732577
No - one here to hear.	15.952635906934029
Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind.	13.548109946289662
What then?	24.46790118898062
A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master ’ s praise.	13.203683836274774
Why had they chosen all that part?	15.152460952865134
Not wholly for the smooth caress.	20.429412760485345
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.	12.914296950551671
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam ’ s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death.	10.101171423087647
They are not to be thought away.	18.663936270382322
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted.	17.95062410367246
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were?	14.310217157651032
Or was that only possible which came to pass?	19.293875845191945
Weave, weaver of the wind.	19.12749792029657
— Tell us a story, sir.	14.290782793626953
— O, do, sir.	15.47246584601085
A ghoststory.	23.306944076913396
— Where do you begin in this?	17.271680471159176
Stephen asked, opening another book.	14.587067027690377
— _Weep no more, _ Comyn said.	15.298893297224653
— And the story, sir?	15.365264410355813
— After, Stephen said.	11.058244673553322
Go on, Talbot.	21.799840882503826
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel.	11.1921353842124
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text: _ — Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor... _ It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.	12.586662647678649
Aristotle ’ s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night.	12.669938862490973
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy.	6.7648609724384405
Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind ’ s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.	9.65922803056297
Thought is the thought of thought.	28.236011190655912
Tranquil brightness.	23.29467287696825
The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms.	25.99430779123984
Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.	8.881958028883075
Talbot repeated: _ — Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves, Through the dear might... _ — Turn over, Stephen said quietly.	12.732231501274974
I don ’ t see anything.	13.285509992221662
— What, sir?	14.733321469335518
Talbot asked simply, bending forward.	12.763824224421683
His hand turned the page over.	16.803735514065746
He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered.	20.40769747952295
Of him that walked the waves.	15.783025273698723
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer ’ s heart and lips and on mine.	12.310127571990444
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute.	14.951000323158636
To Caesar what is Caesar ’ s, to God what is God ’ s.	19.404526491190094
A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church ’ s looms.	17.317692056800094
Ay. Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.	14.056471555824727
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.	12.623570463826418
— Have I heard all?	17.109348451579695
Stephen asked.	15.442182356790978
— Yes, sir.	7.883810949841353
Hockey at ten, sir.	13.168372153833252
— Half day, sir.	14.023928811802028
Thursday.	38.74416493262269
— Who can answer a riddle?	10.707982313684958
Stephen asked.	15.442182356790978
They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.	7.716933646234438
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily: — A riddle, sir?	9.971592572433757
— O, ask me, sir.	14.211985700378465
— A hard one, sir.	15.329026621593046
— This is the riddle, Stephen said: The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven.	13.101252848424332
’ Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven.	11.942621999319423
What is that?	15.00768726589562
— What, sir?	14.733321469335518
We didn ’ t hear.	17.298756097116105
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated.	14.476782893099449
After a silence Cochrane said: — What is it, sir?	15.617619672278163
We give it up.	19.102647151799058
Stephen, his throat itching, answered: — The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.	14.02868736371185
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay.	10.321677769152098
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called: — Hockey! They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.	14.770804172827743
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues.	13.942992774064814
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook.	10.985616953519138
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.	8.05758637372021
On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail ’ s bed.	10.267096944433835
He held out his copybook.	17.621104370094116
The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.	14.317814401952484
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot.	10.374249392820545
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.	18.174720511975806
— Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir.	20.864776811364028
Stephen touched the edges of the book.	21.584134824297283
Futility.	44.876532221709276
— Do you understand how to do them now?	16.871282666531478
he asked.	10.295735601437203
— Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered.	8.429726866879367
— Can you do them yourself?	16.36544537272014
Stephen asked.	15.442182356790978
— No, sir.	11.348966992446119
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail ’ s bed.	13.731641367837469
Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.	22.97977685734995
She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own.	10.097854246796123
Was that then real?	18.66466395092576
The only true thing in life?	17.64305008847526
His mother ’ s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode.	8.710668100640776
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes.	16.565187125611068
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.	11.53453270394755
A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.	11.403624173097494
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.	18.348836637474726
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare ’ s ghost is Hamlet ’ s grandfather.	13.597940111212997
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses.	12.036191418378161
Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.	24.99183082647558
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.	9.932290132031083
Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.	10.775913674188855
Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.	11.132605503137267
— Do you understand now?	13.603606276515723
Can you work the second for yourself?	17.979562899097346
— Yes, sir.	7.883810949841353
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data.	7.521720266302135
Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin.	12.218843914733501
_Amor matris: _ subjective and objective genitive.	11.361394829338291
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.	9.896905216897606
My childhood bends beside me.	12.098681037115
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly.	17.689099804277443
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes.	15.743544351037887
Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.	9.88674090162999
The sum was done.	15.13290852857886
— It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.	16.523992212257248
— Yes, sir.	7.883810949841353
Thanks, Sargent answered.	13.388972933090292
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench.	13.382349524818029
— You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’ s graceless form.	17.30050208228931
— Yes, sir.	7.883810949841353
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.	18.09089259078858
— Sargent! — Run on, Stephen said.	15.135222837679352
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife.	10.923879991009485
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.	7.856141481417189
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him.	10.750182409157958
He turned his angry white moustache.	11.051084987557182
he cried continually without listening.	12.718429228558305
— Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.	13.327720893378734
— Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here.	15.675288411807234
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man ’ s voice cried sternly: — What is the matter?	16.770483820340665
What is it now?	22.64309886973822
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.	12.175819847394955
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs.	14.309830342924016
As on the first day he bargained with me here.	19.458081507366888
As it was in the beginning, is now.	26.62951065031813
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be.	11.065983419706088
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end.	10.783366178050448
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor.	20.806297832442173
Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.	15.147043660484972
— First, our little financial settlement, he said.	9.705524746741853
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong.	14.50798630955705
— Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.	10.740678238811038
And now his strongroom for the gold.	17.06400989923182
Stephen ’ s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir ’ s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James.	11.954363771613144
An old pilgrim ’ s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.	10.532777291460844
A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.	17.820743825931466
— Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.	14.40919285277264
These are handy things to have.	13.664681284585745
See.	24.911255766279794
This is for sovereigns.	14.708488732981497
This is for shillings.	15.858267241894126
Sixpences, halfcrowns.	15.73823202369789
And here crowns.	17.771136588921795
See.	24.911255766279794
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.	12.557337014882751
— Three twelve, he said.	11.094631890191614
I think you ’ ll find that ’ s right.	18.287518164360016
— Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.	14.342562367708346
— No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said.	12.696706593114602
You have earned it.	13.036439347153788
Stephen ’ s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells.	22.567526985076974
Symbols too of beauty and of power.	22.43261063442531
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.	10.733895970723102
— Don ’ t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said.	12.458140933056946
You ’ ll pull it out somewhere and lose it.	14.774070806231284
You just buy one of these machines.	17.078351817941602
You ’ ll find them very handy.	12.400529249031345
Answer something.	25.495769332948
— Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.	11.395789420416168
The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same.	19.488783938397336
Three times now.	18.7178243677779
Three nooses round me here.	11.895359270461979
Well?	29.103223780398952
I can break them in this instant if I will.	20.806920746131567
— Because you don ’ t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger.	14.651221717077574
You don ’ t know yet what money is.	11.033056081503863
When you have lived as long as I have.	19.38582843837238
I know, I know.	19.7806986037377
If youth but knew.	15.355130034957154
But what does Shakespeare say?	14.304443478026991
_Put but money in thy <URL> — Iago, Stephen murmured.	14.570076071690755
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man ’ s stare.	21.47110970849639
— He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said.	13.117122524106545
He made money.	17.0680502896263
A poet, yes, but an Englishman too.	18.33515502322067
Do you know what is the pride of the English?	23.350953820617377
The seas ’ ruler.	12.144192683205372
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.	16.437129386943262
— That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.	18.29649516862337
— Ba! Mr Deasy cried.	18.57432420513345
That ’ s not English.	14.90853156369138
A French Celt said that.	12.087972732292606
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.	11.884078968530766
— I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast.	15.456674372826834
_I paid my <URL> Good man, good man.	19.05994773938894
_ — I paid my way.	16.805010636770373
I never borrowed a shilling in my <URL> Can you feel that?	16.691511497777825
_I owe <URL> Can you?	14.96471395384017
Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.	14.554678599882786
Curran, ten guineas.	18.08060003679492
McCann, one guinea.	25.575946073955826
Fred Ryan, two shillings.	15.362006790612226
Temple, two lunches.	23.205737018125276
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks ’ board.	10.197584106818127
The lump I have is useless.	15.021508239475295
— For the moment, no, Stephen answered.	21.13551714531578
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.	12.210104260545153
— I knew you couldn ’ t, he said joyously.	14.96236719507324
But one day you must feel it.	16.80784315948223
We are a generous people but we must also be just.	10.827289287175619
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.	11.382735787838698
— You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.	13.575559419963351
I saw three generations since O ’ Connell ’ s time.	15.343248460525423
I remember the famine in ’ <NUM>.	12.19577871370209
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O ’ Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue?	12.068608801279725
You fenians forget some things.	10.568239275525855
Glorious, pious and immortal memory.	10.736457939160507
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes.	5.642935251391025
Hoarse, masked and armed, the planters ’ covenant.	11.829882138463278
The black north and true blue bible.	11.768403171733816
Croppies lie down.	17.85668193226776
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.	13.647578711402804
— I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said.	13.234708890241318
On the spindle side.	12.58300546518337
But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union.	14.862972743342599
We are all Irish, all kings ’ sons.	14.704552000837488
— Alas, Stephen said.	11.288978532661936
— _Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto.	11.769088492889775
He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.	16.059947433911812
Lal the ral the ra The rocky road to Dublin.	8.393684877694843
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots.	6.672676956065707
Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!...	12.495127576198525
Day!...	13.811446654964385
Day!...	13.811446654964385
Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin.	12.973608174358157
Lal the ral the ra.	9.837149641803308
Lal the ral the raddy.	9.064738674673446
— That reminds me, Mr Deasy said.	12.008670791022436
You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends.	19.290845944622152
I have a letter here for the press.	22.362424424208726
Sit down a moment.	20.702377596446443
I have just to copy the end.	14.03414910152342
He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.	20.236381635388252
— Sit down.	15.094201389087285
Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of common <URL> Just a moment.	11.900585864523723
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.	12.607344743326243
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.	11.410300616009334
Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings ’ _Repulse_, the duke of Westminster ’ s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort ’ s _Ceylon_, _prix de Paris_, <NUM>.	10.038910009372712
Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign.	18.722588650553888
— Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys.	13.645137798700322
_But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question... _ Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush.	10.339144328205247
Even money _Fair <URL> Ten to one the field.	10.143678632836313
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher ’ s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.	10.205620736213465
Shouts rang shrill from the boys ’ playfield and a whirring whistle.	16.08355825377427
Again: a goal.	25.109905094042652
I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life.	15.376684883636505
You mean that knockkneed mother ’ s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick?	12.884320076600117
Jousts.	44.25662045647404
Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.	7.688766185187673
Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men ’ s bloodied guts.	12.463216999500382
— Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.	20.257579241857535
Stephen stood up.	18.015635225802
— I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said.	14.643026439040929
It ’ s about the foot and mouth disease.	13.660328777703935
Just look through it.	16.128926022193937
There can be no two opinions on the matter.	17.90978248480366
May I trespass on your valuable space.	12.487164462250414
That doctrine of _laissez faire_ which so often in our history.	8.699564166653488
Our cattle trade.	16.89867136319792
The way of all our old industries.	19.577412814610184

Pardoned a classical allusion.	13.187094394032913
Cassandra.	44.876532221709276
By a woman who was no better than she should be.	17.7762066097247
To come to the point at issue.	23.86867509626047
— I don ’ t mince words, do I?	15.843160219847695
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.	12.697946460885044
Foot and mouth disease.	13.242992266595117
Known as Koch ’ s preparation.	19.325740977575574

Mr Henry Blackwood Price.	13.523072188142537
Courteous offer a fair trial.	13.25880998999461
Dictates of common sense.	16.07051620258199
Allimportant question.	23.03815345025011
In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns.	18.746527284906847
Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.	22.20258569172681
— I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said.	16.82378876661722
You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle.	12.220825944663613
And it can be cured.	17.32733298009304
It is cured.	17.201903361789054
My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there.	8.203883245132841
They offer to come over here.	15.446902010251488
I am trying to work up influence with the department.	16.11316195900608
I am surrounded by difficulties, by...	11.46911993687732
intrigues by...	18.286425333771682
backstairs influence by...	14.827491051291242
He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.	12.594337359887172
— Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said.	13.386461917667281
England is in the hands of the jews.	34.92918876268434
In all the highest places: her finance, her press.	19.725196636716078
And they are the signs of a nation ’ s decay.	25.969586674665806
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation ’ s vital strength.	15.351517786664992
I have seen it coming these years.	11.683909655493814
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.	12.692116094806911
Old England is dying.	15.518456426473593
He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam.	14.58615621214821
He faced about and back again.	12.759865040153933
— Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.	18.24318075175047
The harlot ’ s cry from street to street Shall weave old England ’ s windingsheet.	11.572082922645775
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted.	11.555411502336181
— A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?	13.696622280985125
— They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely.	16.008387403473805
And you can see the darkness in their eyes.	22.93799734209778
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day.	21.8110771856538
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers.	8.909722516383406
Gabble of geese.	15.174090969305718
They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats.	9.457315074319913
Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.	11.138913561577587
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain.	9.681379947114314
Vain patience to heap and hoard.	9.325487944112528
Time surely would scatter all.	10.695924868261251
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.	10.108854684236432
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.	12.595994399796593
— Who has not?	20.39722916685677
Stephen said.	12.163642004899454
— What do you mean?	16.57366798164089
Mr Deasy asked.	14.05150192944802
He came forward a pace and stood by the table.	16.791737835636088
His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly.	9.764023856213038
Is this old wisdom?	17.281691241128986
He waits to hear from me.	15.396069541319424
— History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.	17.084438337109557
From the playfield the boys raised a shout.	12.844004223951645
A whirring whistle: goal.	10.186818107477643
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?	15.811939050802765
— The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said.	13.398715793739997
All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.	11.504428729287742
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying: — That is God.	17.568891788097464
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee! — What?	12.535818767671575
Mr Deasy asked.	14.05150192944802
— A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.	15.331759322442679
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers.	13.901636873693814
Looking up again he set them free.	13.965332151729996
— I am happier than you are, he said.	11.780962810318353
We have committed many errors and many sins.	9.01413741171782
A woman brought sin into the world.	11.847254687279513
For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy.	11.747522204752507
A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough ’ s wife and her leman, O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	11.565404875819564
A woman too brought Parnell low.	11.44355625972562
Many errors, many failures but not the one sin.	14.013663150111956
I am a struggler now at the end of my days.	15.25038583504476
But I will fight for the right till the end.	27.357439834380717
For Ulster will fight And Ulster will be right.	12.15004173237506
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.	16.667770030294893
— Well, sir, he began.	20.089074620031845
— I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work.	13.499763244572316
You were not born to be a teacher, I think.	17.058789282692672
Perhaps I am wrong.	25.885532208058553
— A learner rather, Stephen said.	9.603689196349432
And here what will you learn more?	15.441579131040786
Mr Deasy shook his head.	13.337261325824946
— Who knows?	16.179090835392238
he said.	10.465399985534118
To learn one must be humble.	16.113116537098836
But life is the great teacher.	26.62319756719091
Stephen rustled the sheets again.	13.953990283406158
— As regards these, he began.	17.5838357255178
— Yes, Mr Deasy said.	8.903501992284886
You have two copies there.	11.132265540755029
If you can have them published at once.	13.053124579293703
_ Telegraph.	25.240739449321982
Irish <URL> — I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow.	23.01162014200782
I know two editors slightly.	11.196186831992936
— That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly.	13.016895064224464
I wrote last night to Mr Field, <URL>. There is a meeting of the cattletraders ’ association today at the City Arms hotel.	16.05298249108279
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting.	17.2788105116941
You see if you can get it into your two papers.	17.896190185939403
What are they?	22.109933051066893
_ — The Evening Telegraph... _ — That will do, Mr Deasy said.	15.169245361266503
There is no time to lose.	20.451579817000187
Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin.	19.0870292108841
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.	13.259020656743077
Thank you.	18.917318561470015
— Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.	16.519948393916042
I like to break a lance with you, old as I am.	18.83853198750712
— Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.	16.45898064211475
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.	14.267596049500726
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors.	15.474388738748516
Still I will help him in his fight.	25.791762070383314
Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.	16.525176964612037
— Mr Dedalus! Running after me.	12.174238208066269
No more letters, I hope.	23.552931268475138
— Just one moment.	14.93655640274836
— Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.	13.63336251991238
Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.	10.051028771882201
— I just wanted to say, he said.	15.148761040552552
Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews.	15.686395787074458
Do you know that?	15.47685853157698
No. And do you know why?	18.36722151894381
He frowned sternly on the bright air.	19.74707562086597
— Why, sir?	17.33384794904585
Stephen asked, beginning to smile.	16.726600867768756
— Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.	18.542017442455233
He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air.	14.077120958040439
— She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path.	16.940868884159276
That ’ s why.	15.679631053135342
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.	9.67663967101095
Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes.	16.960826662002955
Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot.	16.28985293211066
Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs.	7.1134585848549134
Limits of the diaphane.	37.24944782859834
But he adds: in bodies.	13.520605517185198
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured.	19.064459987508265
How?	26.78930661826885
By knocking his sconce against them, sure.	12.557879362100328
Go easy.	25.713855960787726
Bald he was and a millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_.	9.97694517880776
Limit of the diaphane in.	27.394549192691198
Why in?	21.942484055293022
Diaphane, adiaphane.	15.313552009477387
If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door.	18.29665813283729
Shut your eyes and see.	20.09679565132519
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells.	11.957132692114783
You are walking through it howsomever.	11.684924764801675
A very short space of time through very short times of space.	11.666018383243266
Five, six: the _nacheinander_.	20.861568206919998
Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible.	27.244577893328433
Open your eyes.	18.498545541716002
No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles o ’ er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_ ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark.	10.98022535643237
My ash sword hangs at my side.	11.556757363543126
Tap with it: they do.	24.777783017235475
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, _nebeneinander_.	23.077087522019333
Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los Demiurgos_.	10.791639757204695
Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?	10.78034496726603
Crush, crack, crick, crick.	9.488518295077172
Wild sea money.	16.527592181020154
Dominie Deasy kens them a ’.	13.313940253486503
Won ’ t you come to Sandymount, Madeline the mare?	12.73925876018622
Rhythm begins, you see.	16.281154198527332
I hear.	19.2369041685939
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching.	7.356702508023982
No, agallop: _deline the mare_.	7.259961887385996
Open your eyes now.	16.841223891375034
I will.	18.857562091351173
One moment.	18.873060726839974
Has all vanished since?	13.808565910028014
If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane.	16.665025495173595
_Basta! _ I will see if I can see.	28.310201069086137
See now.	21.799865938660194
There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.	16.523831066299028
They came down the steps from Leahy ’ s terrace prudently, _Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand.	11.990721940616913
Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother.	20.829229578406842
Number one swung lourdily her midwife ’ s bag, the other ’ s gamp poked in the beach.	17.55740007512912
From the liberties, out for the day.	17.949397654001892
Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street.	10.733989000714285
One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.	10.888325233884963
Creation from nothing.	15.752295703957117
What has she in the bag?	28.93807064855624
A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.	8.904188752790276
The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh.	13.538379066979536
That is why mystic monks.	11.900541596154198
Will you be as gods?	21.660536497761996
Gaze in your _omphalos_.	21.46958017614599
Hello.	26.268180599479532
Kinch here.	25.918679828986996
Put me on to Edenville.	24.774995900129927
Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.	11.382860450006875
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve.	6.575949189875628
She had no navel.	15.268800574674776
Gaze.	35.36909335234094
Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting.	7.8270267484454115
Womb of sin.	17.402992238844362
Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten.	15.848493808466754
By them, the man with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.	24.98489725377009
From before the ages He willed me and now may not will me away or ever.	12.630466216645397
A _lex eterna_ stays about Him.	8.507624582101055
Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial?	11.256997925355048
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions?	11.181246618878909
Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality.	15.541209550799786
Illstarred heresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.	9.858291858950391
With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.	10.962560899717442
Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs.	11.406192092786876
They are coming, waves.	17.153744264359148
The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of Mananaan.	9.00465933974359
I mustn ’ t forget his letter for the press.	19.940339334424184
And after?	25.999172402033118
The Ship, half twelve.	14.395523448876151
By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.	16.270589266971644
His pace slackened.	14.981509980589895
Here.	19.800593100854
Am I going to aunt Sara ’ s or not?	19.328354477288023
My consubstantial father ’ s voice.	17.30499033072329
Did you see anything of your artist brother Stephen lately?	14.65425371601382
No?	28.978864464467453
Sure he ’ s not down in Strasburg terrace with his aunt Sally?	16.155531164297198
Couldn ’ t he fly a bit higher than that, eh?	14.141533812793885
And and and and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si?	15.834455824795228
O, weeping God, the things I married into! De boys up in de hayloft.	14.657905430081971
The drunken little costdrawer and his brother, the cornet player.	17.145064198327624
Highly respectable gondoliers! And skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! Sir.	10.316150392280543
Yes, sir.	9.971021983540197
No, sir.	12.671120635307762
Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ! I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait.	16.29175108315107
They take me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.	13.302376836199771

Let Stephen in.	20.511198640321087
A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.	10.273801404998046
— We thought you were someone else.	13.603289674534723
In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm.	8.395139412741202
Cleanchested.	44.876532221709276
He has washed the upper moiety.	11.197770788182764
— Morrow, nephew.	11.347859305738377
He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and common searches and a writ of _Duces Tecum_.	6.130352086575267
A bogoak frame over his bald head: Wilde ’ s _Requiescat_.	13.562839648593801
The drone of his misleading whistle brings Walter back.	11.33034756950829

Damn your lithia water.	12.951428992924264
— Sit down or by the law Harry I ’ ll knock you down.	17.462092553222366
Walter squints vainly for a chair.	17.263744910376616
— He has nothing to sit down on, sir.	16.333511402477193
— He has nowhere to put it, you mug.	19.10617243613856
Bring in our chippendale chair.	13.371523397628364
Would you like a bite of something?	18.80203670525884
None of your damned lawdeedaw airs here.	10.730701138723257
The rich of a rasher fried with a herring?	20.620040336283747
Sure?	47.128552239098205
So much the better.	19.10663737203052
The grandest number, Stephen, in the whole opera.	19.947371396779182
Listen.	27.998128761084484
His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.	14.487386465100817
This wind is sweeter.	13.225630001418452
Houses of decay, mine, his and all.	15.919664012953547
You told the Clongowes gentry you had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army.	12.040890565075523
Come out of them, Stephen.	30.029279089565087
Beauty is not there.	24.516688039107443
Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh ’ s library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas.	12.830237414873302
For whom?	25.560083802331103
The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close.	15.769013350182583
A hater of his kind ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his eyeballs stars.	17.283479635583088
Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled.	14.631974252426973

A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace (_descende! _), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed.	10.538866515665948
Get down, baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar ’ s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.	9.648673126576035
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it.	13.580224209032568
Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.	11.532529309381516
Dringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own cheek.	17.783596545026032
Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back.	15.991722705419006
Dan Occam thought of that, invincible doctor.	15.648004649849593
A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled his brain.	6.896343636954003
Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his second bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and, rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang in diphthong.	12.863263555927752
Isle of saints.	24.26696172723631
You were awfully holy, weren ’ t you?	10.031472952199698
You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have a red nose.	19.908891782754072
You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street.	12.568845351190706
_O si, certo! _ Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned round a squaw.	12.328762431337713
More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth tram alone crying to the rain: _Naked women! Naked women! _ What about that, eh?	16.457732073976743
What about what?	18.95192899754455
What else were they invented for?	16.408482416535865
Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh?	9.505683460193438
I was young.	25.11839334094521
You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly, striking face.	12.435347249041929
Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No - one saw: tell no - one.	10.70272700436114

Remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the world, including Alexandria?	11.90551589801816
Someone was to read them there after a few thousand years, a mahamanvantara.	24.939488819555553
Pico della Mirandola like.	10.077273733549987

I wanted to get poor Pat a job one time.	14.411405461399005
_Mon fils_, soldier of France.	8.754436904690765
I taught him to sing _The boys of Kilkenny are stout roaring blades_.	10.804748616940044
Know that old lay?	22.871375578852867
I taught Patrice that.	14.128529036727246
Old Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow ’ s castle on the Nore.	13.049173570015123
Goes like this.	22.06010456928057
_O, O_.	16.96525982601413
O, O the boys of Kilkenny...	13.430248245082502
Weak wasting hand on mine.	14.020379645558574
They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them.	12.974232202739865
Remembering thee, O Sion.	20.673618515235074
He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.	11.734097539840715
The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of seeds of brightness.	9.84940637887212
Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I?	17.258504785067885
He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil.	16.627574258057702
Turn back.	24.822936146118412
Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new sockets.	14.91190632395952
The cold domed room of the tower waits.	16.583448460277367
Through the barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor.	8.032658152571223
Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night.	8.785901343823614
In the darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned platters.	10.934817583675251
Who to clear it?	16.60747423705028
He has the key.	17.40080609065364
I will not sleep there when this night comes.	11.339550446741626
A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer.	16.690735065519952
Call: no answer.	18.322303003308985
He lifted his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders.	16.28981144228992
Take all, keep all.	24.247108586183028
My soul walks with me, form of forms.	15.505184278059591
So in the moon ’ s midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore ’ s tempting flood.	15.244732696886706
The flood is following me.	12.352029442627787
I can watch it flow past from here.	11.378386387078022
Get back then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there.	20.71595006844552
He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a grike.	11.201285203807082
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack.	12.157211302506733
_Un coche ensablé_ Louis Veuillot called Gautier ’ s prose.	8.92797273135689
These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here.	6.816218072403476
And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats.	12.45042733920381
Hide gold there.	17.824103241745455
Try it.	19.62523547066614
You have some.	22.820708599650093
Sands and stones.	17.192600629314178
Heavy of the past.	32.38323052342124
Sir Lout ’ s toys.	22.958076924245646
Mind you don ’ t get one bang on the ear.	16.629596022516818
I ’ m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones.	8.657340027529688
Feefawfum.	44.876532221709276
I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman.	6.620981888925056
A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.	9.579167445535422
Lord, is he going to attack me?	26.16233115728643
Respect his liberty.	17.333381186728175
You will not be master of others or their slave.	14.997031785838335
I have my stick.	14.887592985321628
Sit tight.	23.98574113515491
From farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two.	13.92482793892172
The two maries.	14.854759121065078
They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.	8.235014473135424
Peekaboo.	44.876532221709276
I see you.	18.297346127796224
No, the dog.	28.864826741464764
He is running back to them.	16.36055218044976
Who?	23.95062567534216
Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf.	11.773350159467258
Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold.	7.016090343084114
A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows.	7.379128523652979
Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers ’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat.	7.8242531968807425
Famine, plague and slaughters.	10.031124096063888
Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.	20.330819160518434
I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires.	16.493663917195875
I spoke to no - one: none to me.	16.283923786870776
The dog ’ s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back.	16.773689286349473
Dog of my enemy.	27.620131870832612
I just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about.	10.49326420711429
_Terribilia meditans_.	19.698768402221454
A primrose doublet, fortune ’ s knave, smiled on my fear.	13.69975522145325
For that are you pining, the bark of their applause?	23.549513506535835
Pretenders: live their lives.	11.195456372808621
The Bruce ’ s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York ’ s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned.	10.8295265114542
All kings ’ sons.	12.72933183515327
Paradise of pretenders then and now.	11.92034606147441
He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur ’ s yelping.	14.767509790178163
But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house.	8.40441886047814
House of...	18.716432589626535
We don ’ t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities.	14.6743181896918
Would you do what he did?	31.730080129251018
A boat would be near, a lifebuoy.	24.775165786497222
_Natürlich_, put there for you.	20.263619338344192
Would you or would you not?	17.04203485320132
The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden ’ s rock.	14.430945627841052
They are waiting for him now.	20.180536434373956
The truth, spit it out.	13.630814117385134
I would want to.	19.884043910511842
I would try.	23.713803475298032
I am not a strong swimmer.	17.640980558573297
Water cold soft.	17.55811080165668
When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes.	19.62209462076265
Can ’ t see! Who ’ s behind me?	17.79857227526523
Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured?	10.311514058504669
If I had land under my feet.	15.492021379143718
I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine.	20.918848646223847
A drowning man.	16.936960605459813
His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death.	19.176446150793744
I...	11.542327504094539
With him together down...	13.86755880805172
I could not save her.	18.213649168478184
Waters: bitter death: lost.	11.163135783744936
A woman and a man.	23.649913425842353
I see her skirties.	16.793190875788657
Pinned up, I bet.	35.53846415838163
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all sides.	9.991952379033709
Looking for something lost in a past life.	18.943726155800146
Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull.	12.323472384346559
The man ’ s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears.	10.67153427575507
He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks.	9.96852774871264
On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired.	7.11810510748315
At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears.	9.791255754209631
His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse.	8.815000050667464
They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.	9.659552327024725
Cocklepickers.	44.876532221709276
They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out.	14.771153570453016
The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning.	10.998752130210185
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf ’ s tongue redpanting from his jaws.	16.859350940725186
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf ’ s gallop.	15.689091465394934
The carcass lay on his path.	19.274206262927212
He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog ’ s bedraggled fell.	14.084474088299382
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal.	12.148452840053091
Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody ’ s body.	12.990396482920673
— Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel! The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight.	11.986524652249686
He slunk back in a curve.	20.499857328169536
Doesn ’ t see me.	17.151274440481135
Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it.	11.076104307863211
He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock.	9.826619149938717
The simple pleasures of the poor.	23.31739037005129
His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.	7.331887925252341
He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.	13.622485124507525
Wait.	16.144754643793675
Street of harlots.	14.018253326862991
Remember.	32.473478392172375
Haroun al Raschid.	12.659132376795128
I am almosting it.	12.192843498515286
That man led me, spoke.	20.10802904114521
I was not afraid.	25.19584672154256
The melon he had he held against my face.	18.148876609667475
Smiled: creamfruit smell.	12.473817912455667
That was the rule, said.	15.5799850839527
Red carpet spread.	19.536970709936508
You will see who.	17.099174305302338
Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.	15.32365506953268
His blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck.	9.795565348025283
With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his strolling mort.	12.362016154084577
Spoils slung at her back.	18.96474223661574
About her windraw face hair trailed.	8.37968612784467
Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville.	9.936387081307293
When night hides her body ’ s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired.	9.07865564546943
Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O ’ Loughlin ’ s of Blackpitts.	9.190767471252629
Buss her, wap in rogues ’ rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend ’ s whiteness under her rancid rags.	10.661339262623152
Fumbally ’ s lane that night: the tanyard smells.	21.838660529561174
White thy fambles, red thy gan And thy quarrons dainty is.	6.376495367274421
Couch a hogshead with me then.	13.751761727822618
In the darkmans clip and kiss.	10.149307549957312
Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.	7.129187174155315
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted.	13.40200538273693
Call away let him: _thy quarrons dainty is_.	10.773883159076302
Language no whit worse than his.	12.815896277779359
Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.	7.100478724741574
Passing now.	22.85753964932574
A side eye at my Hamlet hat.	14.505956431952782
If I were suddenly naked here as I sit?	12.804468202952656
I am not.	16.68599381796492
She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load.	5.535379467468306
A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake.	13.069439310291957
Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea.	11.353686636598313
Behold the handmaid of the moon.	17.22459712840403
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise.	10.90874646137147
Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled.	11.190905229561393
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	7.76903384539049
Here.	19.800593100854
Put a pin in that chap, will you?	16.519234316846735
My tablets.	20.92503336195111
Mouth to her kiss.	28.187110964888802
No. Must be two of em.	17.765359317546437
Glue em well.	16.640534380142856
Mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	30.301086868639366
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.	10.489945067483145
Oomb, allwombing tomb.	10.82462818323424
His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayaway.	5.051054059320764
Paper.	44.876532221709276
The banknotes, blast them.	11.998652176085779
Old Deasy ’ s letter.	24.218603363053845
Here.	19.800593100854
Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words.	15.92297626566132
That ’ s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.	17.0729136772529
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending.	18.82920458625618
Why not endless till the farthest star?	10.63090318821317
Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds.	12.815181617196465
Me sits there with his augur ’ s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.	11.558558090737675
I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back.	11.27463099711309
Endless, would it be mine, form of my form?	21.040711254734532
Who watches me here?	19.25781946174682
Who ever anywhere will read these written words?	10.159400846050978
Signs on a white field.	32.06572642127712
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.	15.560215572523976
The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field.	10.947647652095513
Hold hard.	22.544037867931745
Coloured on a flat: yes, that ’ s right.	20.452384021837982
Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back.	13.819018905881444
Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope.	10.299845848858121
Click does the trick.	14.624991664096786
You find my words dark.	14.66549631324014
Darkness is in our souls do you not think?	24.690193136856752
Flutier.	44.876532221709276
Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.	14.910183246463854
She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes.	22.739838882536098
Now where the blue hell am I bringing her beyond the veil?	16.512504947784034
Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality.	14.417757869669336
She, she, she.	20.594874900879606
What she?	23.47926458660948
The virgin at Hodges Figgis ’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write.	11.76052104350702
Keen glance you gave her.	15.10592555446273
Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade.	18.779998050939227
She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters.	15.574080041284462
Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup.	14.153678382711478
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.	8.014452957949432
Talk about apple dumplings, _piuttosto_.	8.281110554514251
Where are your wits?	15.765932013386008
Touch me.	22.142474984642323
Soft eyes.	25.05982878393376
Soft soft soft hand.	14.986202986889401
I am lonely here.	13.611950382254511
O, touch me soon, now.	13.232464724214509
What is that word known to all men?	22.9676037621333
I am quiet here alone.	11.79718067076422
Sad too.	23.761203988274172
Touch, touch me.	14.266904005449566
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes.	12.508572830105141
That is Kevin Egan ’ s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep.	13.257218321175417
_Et vidit Deus.	14.209480476231747
Et erant valde bona_.	9.728229732195292
Alo! _Bonjour_.	14.715258369638006
Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun.	6.566355959929867
I am caught in this burning scene.	14.787225769058315
Pan ’ s hour, the faunal noon.	29.46262163157597
Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.	9.244276403192803
Pain is far.	21.055859490809503
And no more turn aside and brood.	11.548617305112623
His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck ’ s castoffs, _nebeneinander_.	15.181716759252255
He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another ’ s foot had nested warm.	7.97155491820427
The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove.	8.187226556439278
But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt ’ s shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.	13.775720082982875
_Tiens, quel petit pied! _ Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde ’ s love that dare not speak its name.	10.597595018785887
His arm: Cranly ’ s arm.	14.931542189152461
He now will leave me.	11.615922931770275
And the blame?	17.408381228214143
As I am.	19.739465754108828
As I am.	19.739465754108828
All or not at all.	18.56316116849176
In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing.	9.77734090161704
No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks, swirling, passing.	15.023317023163306
Better get this job over quick.	10.354488772923023
Listen: a fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos.	6.288490642399288
Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks.	9.078603916637409
In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels.	5.675101553134328
And, spent, its speech ceases.	10.398167212490609
It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.	6.013878176676487
Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds.	6.8902183968949915
Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall.	11.813661120719418
Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit_.	8.117348787607764
To no end gathered; vainly then released, forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon.	7.200222079130272
Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.	13.257939866516615
Five fathoms out there.	14.95065518700407
Full fathom five thy father lies.	11.924539976569367
At one, he said.	16.962103210561317
Found drowned.	22.079813377683532
High water at Dublin bar.	14.721763681886225
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells.	9.157536933790741
A corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward.	8.0000898660187
There he is.	13.721147308395148
Hook it quick.	16.910889034214073
Pull.	43.11253835167618
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.	11.413805014368712
We have him.	21.271812056590864
Easy now.	24.91358133567017
Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine.	7.420131684757141
A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.	11.257698790534613
God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.	6.799015110059878
Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead.	6.351719187324353
Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.	12.138741483740567
A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue.	12.159207051636354
Seadeath, mildest of all deaths known to man.	13.106537786357041
Old Father Ocean.	16.250756602856587
_Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.	8.293123690551191
Just you give it a fair trial.	17.64629219250501
We enjoyed ourselves immensely.	12.79671759679344
Come.	22.160365043217414
I thirst.	24.986480302119173
Clouding over.	24.28849093549742
No black clouds anywhere, are there?	13.561834291604974
Thunderstorm.	44.876532221709276
Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, _Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_.	7.515694436202445
No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal shoon.	6.835984704366611
Where?	20.307631490117476
To evening lands.	17.636152899474443
Evening will find itself.	16.703875644130274
He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.	12.699973815262062
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me.	18.43436668076023
All days make their end.	11.708789434908546
By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.	14.511422168484739
Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum.	14.88084206890617
Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet.	12.333330322833671
_Già_.	35.61852722871305
For the old hag with the yellow teeth.	18.938291730881776
_Già_.	35.61852722871305
My teeth are very bad.	13.376185959084767
Why, I wonder.	27.71324031248069
Feel.	34.43943922462239
That one is going too.	22.1036383157759
Shells.	44.876532221709276
Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money?	25.492346279645734
That one.	22.29087526847933
This.	28.80116903865326
Toothless Kinch, the superman.	28.542967790931918
Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?	19.501063400059092
My handkerchief.	24.91458257634092
He threw it.	16.584177124367077
I remember.	17.634201561889515
Did I not take it up?	22.10192693503394
His hand groped vainly in his pockets.	14.80771931476102
No, I didn ’ t.	15.870513965541887
Better buy one.	18.9548772316687
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully.	12.067096992509288
For the rest let look who will.	13.718347373710438
Behind.	43.770624527723555
Perhaps there is someone.	22.67390536885048
He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant.	13.641162836183057
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.	12.094841113818898
Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.	9.659986997896576
He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods ’ roes.	6.95795426589442
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.	9.856713499148565
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray.	17.481829324186624
Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.	14.00265644412026
Made him feel a bit peckish.	19.755765399434395
Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right.	11.635527759871898
She didn ’ t like her plate full.	13.251591730930183
Right.	26.368445767368986
He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire.	15.499523335640948
It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out.	11.87323816839632
Cup of tea soon.	19.40750525709535
Good.	25.782918879857334
Mouth dry.	24.5105127000408
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.	11.548456079902337
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing.	9.772437161505213
Just how she stalks over my writingtable.	9.574980461787142
Prr.	35.61852722871305
Scratch my head.	20.63616810696116
Prr.	35.61852722871305
Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form.	7.356919999309758
Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes.	23.19572001451171
He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.	25.67327007712009
— Milk for the pussens, he said.	14.489636969555399
— Mrkgnao! the cat cried.	15.927239106163478
They call them stupid.	19.26809865043169
They understand what we say better than we understand them.	12.330155018774304
She understands all she wants to.	12.23485982737531
Vindictive too.	22.877819035878947
Cruel.	37.15636826260063
Her nature.	24.460070851900895
Curious mice never squeal.	12.268834501632154
Seem to like it.	17.477440393291175
Wonder what I look like to her.	25.198225506930402
Height of a tower?	35.2858760731136
No, she can jump me.	16.83478283276431
— Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly.	21.954931710922548
Afraid of the chookchooks.	36.4343340158623
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.	16.711792325294674
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth.	10.858777178058428
He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.	9.595058328559809
Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon ’ s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.	14.51624079140002
— Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.	11.845181331188513
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly.	10.623147103613865
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can ’ t mouse after.	15.673556275066922
Why?	18.457368458488407
They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips.	23.581047579105775
Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.	18.767600271894487
He listened to her licking lap.	18.61606927525284
Ham and eggs, no.	17.567300393151335
No good eggs with this drouth.	11.964999076208006
Want pure fresh water.	14.738253081602469
Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley ’ s.	15.421758213689607
Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.	18.51572382302171
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz ’ s.	9.978511619925124
While the kettle is boiling.	13.821490336548745
Why are their tongues so rough?	11.830306293905794
To lap better, all porous holes.	15.660025939831494
Nothing she can eat?	19.3400889605449
He glanced round him.	15.197821416136199
She might like something tasty.	14.078958967147308
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning.	14.581619429534369
Still perhaps: once in a way.	17.62501165031609
He said softly in the bare hall: — I ’ m going round the corner.	16.165907461712916
Be back in a minute.	24.09348500886652
And when he had heard his voice say it he added: — You don ’ t want anything for breakfast?	16.589864199037788
A sleepy soft grunt answered: — Mn. No. She didn ’ t want anything.	11.365686457281857
Must get those settled really.	12.31729691038109
Pity.	30.820763982103497
All the way from Gibraltar.	19.34831113569239
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew.	11.944254875728952
Wonder what her father gave for it.	14.061791038460836
Old style.	23.439604381340946
Ah yes! of course.	17.61618992819885
Bought it at the governor ’ s auction.	26.11551507413143
Got a short knock.	16.666576382016974
Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy.	15.850312636841414
Yes, sir.	9.971021983540197
At Plevna that was.	17.58824533825483
I rose from the ranks, sir, and I ’ m proud of it.	18.2060122575797
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps.	17.156598265137653
Now that was farseeing.	25.144390736497297
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof.	13.15337217022928
Stamps: stickyback pictures.	11.284769246658122
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too.	14.90429985383386
Course they do.	20.42395791114982
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto ’ s high grade ha.	16.03932044896382
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband.	9.201386091543982
White slip of paper.	14.983762546174406
Quite safe.	24.07643653569603
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey.	17.469117941406516
In the trousers I left off.	17.2066033772913
Must get it.	19.283462383241755
Potato I have.	24.598526529468316
Creaky wardrobe.	21.577729785062214
No use disturbing her.	11.895778040914383
She turned over sleepily that time.	13.24990112027269
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.	14.007781008807294
Looked shut.	24.376069936316824
All right till I come back anyhow.	19.813970858775388
He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive.	12.308280339075722
The sun was nearing the steeple of George ’ s church.	11.385654642564075
Be a warm day I fancy.	17.479279223781283
Specially in these black clothes feel it more.	11.752071159232917
Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat.	14.264108056044183
But I couldn ’ t go in that light suit.	17.406445374592742
Make a picnic of it.	14.490093927519597
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth.	10.75965042163679
Boland ’ s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday ’ s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.	10.12344434734885
Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn.	15.052638642690825
Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day ’ s march on him.	17.747074968417316
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.	16.49274497078309
Walk along a strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy ’ s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.	17.69902096829382
Wander through awned streets.	11.209410797771461
Turbaned faces going by.	16.294337542745023
Dark caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe.	8.000674439737374
Cries of sellers in the streets.	20.689974243879764
Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet.	8.10460821915037
Dander along all day.	15.247097527998479
Might meet a robber or two.	13.526945243452694
Well, meet him.	15.756851788315567
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up.	14.846135962791346
A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind.	23.2997756259496
I pass on.	21.831861028753234
Fading gold sky.	16.41575402312444
A mother watches me from her doorway.	17.69433915155354
She calls her children home in their dark language.	15.897382562305227
High wall: beyond strings twanged.	9.850251499641706
Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly ’ s new garters.	12.154720385236942
Strings.	44.876532221709276
Listen.	27.998128761084484
I pass.	25.453908532699334
Probably not a bit like it really.	27.18410312644029
Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun.	20.901101944000217
Sunburst on the titlepage.	34.12625230640094
He smiled, pleasing himself.	11.391398187861558
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland.	13.182237881881683
He prolonged his pleased smile.	11.348795549626871
Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	11.683884410195096
He approached Larry O ’ Rourke ’ s.	11.784281155379249
From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter.	8.909858893339626
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.	7.744820017502217
Good house, however: just the end of the city traffic.	21.268688410217646
For instance M ’ Auley ’ s down there: n.	17.09385528700619
g.	37.12289028372609
as position.	13.837677365999804
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.	14.467030244765233
Baldhead over the blind.	32.29681614535839
Cute old codger.	14.71045399844396
No use canvassing him for an ad.	15.60223604640683
Still he knows his own business best.	17.189840099480325
There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket.	11.36245327770253
Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up.	19.97522556227309
Do you know what I ’ m going to tell you?	14.770839895724516
What ’ s that, Mr O ’ Rourke?	18.6732577126763
Do you know what?	15.447061228832343
The Russians, they ’ d only be an eight o ’ clock breakfast for the Japanese.	14.500082188152229
Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps.	18.896433548408982
Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O ’ Rourke.	15.653706657514553
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway: — Good day, Mr O ’ Rourke.	15.214560436987435
— Good day to you.	16.195935628593105
— Lovely weather, sir.	11.73720808734785
— ’ Tis all that.	12.01554318346038
Where do they get the money?	24.707509079193947
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar.	11.625833730831081
Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.	7.663601705860536
Then think of the competition.	32.470511629004754
General thirst.	23.158773935556447
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub.	10.853967638992128
Save it they can ’ t.	14.75006895113261
Off the drunks perhaps.	13.040280995234603
Put down three and carry five.	13.536799756493437
What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs.	15.762887504243693
Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers.	15.452485283874298
Square it you with the boss and we ’ ll split the job, see?	18.00418044780758
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month?	17.78022923399593
Say ten barrels of stuff.	14.203457676261271
Say he got ten per cent off.	14.31844342627518
O more.	26.061011611436815
Fifteen.	34.66058585774379
He passed Saint Joseph ’ s National school.	15.305720592133246
Brats ’ clamour.	16.320962263476197
Windows open.	23.531423354285373
Fresh air helps memory.	12.48890321785574

Slieve Bloom.	26.095524158244793
He halted before Dlugacz ’ s window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies, black and white.	12.889626644712413
Fifteen multiplied by.	18.051471728064776
The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade.	13.870628002206747
The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs ’ blood.	6.862072845128371
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last.	14.299239138614364
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter.	17.9757830084842
Would she buy it too, calling the items from a slip in her hand?	17.391780826478993
Chapped: washingsoda.	14.710701146333635
And a pound and a half of Denny ’ s sausages.	18.204098738641864
His eyes rested on her vigorous hips.	14.770073703495724
Woods his name is.	22.71107005945331
Wonder what he does.	20.3076618699576
Wife is oldish.	15.23659319240503
New blood.	26.61103670536935
No followers allowed.	14.562850584336465
Strong pair of arms.	25.150694738902658
Whacking a carpet on the clothesline.	19.288678298098436
She does whack it, by George.	22.067176730959453
The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.	9.593609379236963
Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.	14.608543437647246
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias.	10.879389407620767
Can become ideal winter sanatorium.	9.939421620782454
Moses Montefiore.	24.017539755488247
I thought he was.	17.624076723004286
Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping.	12.811995133281888
He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling.	17.743308937221112
A young white heifer.	12.69128979168364
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there ’ s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands.	10.462895378736151
He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest.	12.326319126937936
The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.	7.775444252400906
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace.	10.493276118287422
— Now, my miss, he said.	14.853978874975185
She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.	10.405918139525012
— Thank you, my miss.	16.389552483751764
And one shilling threepence change.	11.140841646158625
Mr Bloom pointed quickly.	14.825699435263354
To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams.	15.784680330510666
Pleasant to see first thing in the morning.	21.398291560436657
Hurry up, damn it.	20.804080914999115
Make hay while the sun shines.	18.427893941318498
He sighed down his nose: they never understand.	18.48945370388173
Sodachapped hands.	23.547154030148292
Crusted toenails too.	15.133280277472831
Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.	6.633513260000921
The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast.	7.071299589297698
For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles ’ Lane.	11.725046741556195
They like them sizeable.	13.590361629399398
Prime sausage.	22.449801410497564
O please, Mr Policeman, I ’ m lost in the wood.	23.70351710580578
— Threepence, please.	11.643862355976836
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.	7.914911516757444
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers ’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles.	12.876796165847052
They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.	11.235861689902954
— Thank you, sir.	10.731910982015261
Another time.	23.762073308195454
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him.	7.641214117625802
He withdrew his gaze after an instant.	12.568897950341325
No: better not: another time.	12.464205639615365
— Good morning, he said, moving away.	15.07730591351268
— Good morning, sir.	10.153435903822468
No sign.	24.49825812167302
Gone.	25.591004547417455
What matter?	25.710404367397285
He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely.	13.920816702746643
Agendath Netaim: planters ’ company.	10.304469561319236
To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees.	6.23809520409292
Excellent for shade, fuel and construction.	9.977627726222577
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.	9.094905883724682
You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons.	7.937274338404889
Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation.	7.716390727036152
Every year you get a sending of the crop.	22.23076615445115
Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union.	19.410053000849814
Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments.	13.838212375811786
Bleibtreustrasse <NUM>, Berlin, W.	15.132862011183649
<NUM>.	23.23332900768059
Nothing doing.	24.563211350800096
He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat.	12.911010136076564
Silverpowdered olivetrees.	19.698768402221454
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening.	9.247599458014289
Olives are packed in jars, eh?	8.563119408407061
I have a few left from Andrews.	14.550674108824547
Molly spitting them out.	16.904257742199533
Knows the taste of them now.	18.176491364993744
Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.	9.570959719662698
Citrons too.	24.92114304911329
Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin ’ s parade.	12.970062295014335
And Mastiansky with the old cither.	24.960783067395667
Pleasant evenings we had then.	18.81516474103029
Molly in Citron ’ s basketchair.	20.39228286976167
Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.	13.764290244267226
Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume.	14.550354212813525
Always the same, year after year.	14.057862362192386
They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me.	10.559819003490722
Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times.	10.573215517398243
Must be without a flaw, he said.	12.6267444674338
Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant.	17.56811715347875
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees.	9.777804698333368
There ’ s whatdoyoucallhim out of.	16.63828460935143
How do you?	17.13381368327528
Doesn ’ t see.	16.836120509131668
Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore.	23.01225771117742
His back is like that Norwegian captain ’ s.	14.002113961367574
Watering cart.	20.531865173387942
To provoke the rain.	13.598229158410904
On earth as it is in heaven.	23.0267274854649
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly.	12.714276592997484
Grey.	45.71905876676923
Far.	26.208209260915574
No, not like that.	19.55159336291288
A barren land, bare waste.	13.836615794584336
Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth.	13.833665738740002
No wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters.	8.150203592341207
Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom.	11.634669625873867
All dead names.	16.92740653101832
A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old.	21.927594037905408
Old now.	23.578064401953966
It bore the oldest, the first race.	20.05542859907271
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy ’ s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.	11.142629103825922
The oldest people.	15.939127817154343
Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere.	11.123563399225263
It lay there now.	15.451399802020493
Now it could bear no more.	12.339464926231997
Dead: an old woman ’ s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.	17.10541685720138
Desolation.	44.876532221709276
Grey horror seared his flesh.	10.307170667381783
Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward.	14.953481511474209
Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.	8.468818776054805
Well, I am here now.	16.475656580985866
Yes, I am here now.	16.080268099253406
Morning mouth bad images.	13.635221849838265
Got up wrong side of the bed.	15.875189101279672
Must begin again those Sandow ’ s exercises.	14.41607990175691
On the hands down.	15.011541377614224
Blotchy brown brick houses.	12.425160820873597
Number eighty still unlet.	11.81033577497529
Why is that?	18.945374414674838
Valuation is only twentyeight.	15.809877427966741
Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills.	6.2474028060889255
Plasters on a sore eye.	23.776201142788665
To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter.	12.378883268759449
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh.	10.832732741797084
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath.	9.619660386681025
Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.	27.455117880017344
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor.	26.008721978993478
He stooped and gathered them.	11.320885973759308
Mrs Marion Bloom.	15.22628311121149
His quickened heart slowed at once.	9.262644161046483
Bold hand.	19.861291235912113
Mrs Marion.	16.773210439704247
— Poldy! Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.	8.226191699269616
— Who are the letters for?	21.077354433689596
He looked at them.	14.341903084461153
Mullingar.	34.36421338257974
Milly.	36.494839736419124
— A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.	22.61704303365265
And a letter for you.	18.621519470707614
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.	13.62974293731972
— Do you want the blind up?	12.53343233861661
— That do?	16.928124964304892
he asked, turning.	15.478492421013234
She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.	14.762638917891737
— She got the things, she said.	14.790647187148188
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.	14.774118676228634
— Hurry up with that tea, she said.	16.9413251827568
I ’ m parched.	12.813178593392559
— The kettle is boiling, he said.	9.39052129433577
But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.	12.482550965581241
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called: — Poldy! — What?	19.737092107288955
— Scald the teapot.	13.85551775611273
On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout.	13.70935767822
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in.	11.632835405506396
Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt.	12.195304436332993
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him.	8.628784266776783
Give her too much meat she won ’ t mouse.	14.133215221114726
Say they won ’ t eat pork.	15.388353642371078
Kosher.	37.12289028372609
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce.	10.376410631961233
Pepper.	44.25662045647404
Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.	13.621029929586166
Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan ’ s seaside girls.	7.860441088870789
The tea was drawn.	15.022875692914482
He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby, smiling.	10.813821231966173
Silly Milly ’ s birthday gift.	20.599557866925895
No, wait: four.	14.993399559666834
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke.	10.781185546400618
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her.	15.938219607658477
He smiled, pouring.	16.023933609945544
You are my lookingglass from night to morning.	9.287521549923273
I ’ d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.	10.71611337673175
Poor old professor Goodwin.	15.900704523981016
Dreadful old case.	17.17993276956758
Still he was a courteous old chap.	18.400798378246968
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform.	15.981990744070698
And the little mirror in his silk hat.	20.771288301414884
O, look what I found in professor Goodwin ’ s hat! All we laughed.	15.887924784663026
Sex breaking out even then.	13.310362066720153
Pert little piece she was.	14.709782449025855
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray.	13.507078826993757
Its hump bumped as he took it up.	15.405791728657729
Everything on it?	27.72529277628908
Yes.	14.82237916275066
He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.	18.20464257864855
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.	19.18505014643863
— What a time you were! she said.	14.615983047746221
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat ’ s udder.	11.2083342392959
The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.	19.166193001221508
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow.	9.570461945758208
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.	9.02594606658716
— Who was the letter from?	27.241797862528607
he asked.	10.295735601437203
Bold hand.	19.861291235912113
Marion.	37.85467602249615
— O, Boylan, she said.	14.821404260589492
He ’ s bringing the programme.	13.8592947674353
— What are you singing?	16.12454790419196
— _Là ci darem_ with J.	7.29314565706051
Doyle, she said, and _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_.	19.516487635602978
Her full lips, drinking, smiled.	15.87646655086134
Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day.	8.999464666035738
Like foul flowerwater.	15.393737417229113
— Would you like the window open a little?	23.129846145228278
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking: — What time is the funeral?	16.343184927224858
— Eleven, I think, he answered.	25.664195322805487
I didn ’ t see the paper.	15.049155442918412
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed.	19.803836796147223
No?	28.978864464467453
Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.	9.19863607534385
— No: that book.	18.969123558501337
Other stocking.	22.225330771285687
Her petticoat.	24.52105587415712
— It must have fell down, she said.	14.75475076692675
He felt here and there.	14.418758857679165
_Voglio e non vorrei_.	10.554453105048426
Wonder if she pronounces that right: _voglio_.	11.018151398264555
Not in the bed.	27.61886032629183
Must have slid down.	13.6535357491419
He stooped and lifted the valance.	12.266553946003082
The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.	14.374327377246889
— Show here, she said.	15.18131046022617
I put a mark in it.	16.918834452251737
There ’ s a word I wanted to ask you.	17.77825263118825
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.	11.916558111178126
— Met him what?	19.44825767832814
he asked.	10.295735601437203
What does that mean?	14.811694002125403
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.	11.617549988385976
— Metempsychosis?	22.25423273046158
— Yes.	10.060020338761374
— Metempsychosis, he said, frowning.	19.77481668505293
It ’ s Greek: from the Greek.	19.517311518908347
That means the transmigration of souls.	10.446661477020019
— O, rocks! she said.	12.81923799155494
Tell us in plain words.	16.620346062603083
The same young eyes.	17.480671539756298
The first night after the charades.	19.67836245010296
Dolphin ’ s Barn.	20.4464765965099
He turned over the smudged pages.	14.79789546130507
_Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_.	30.126756356729082
Hello.	26.268180599479532
Fierce Italian with carriagewhip.	12.675931099124343
Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor naked.	16.38151310051116
Sheet kindly lent.	17.258798299036933
_The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath_.	11.386145491152893
Cruelty behind it all.	20.939169189610645
Doped animals.	23.782919898942286
Trapeze at Hengler ’ s.	12.006737338455723
Had to look the other way.	20.45013397676747
Mob gaping.	24.04739310892301
Break your neck and we ’ ll break our sides.	15.045375479478357
Families of them.	20.577639107758014
Bone them young so they metamspychosis.	13.112380559874891
That we live after death.	13.01722517776695
Our souls.	22.952657027985886
That a man ’ s soul after he dies.	16.862499188383936
Dignam ’ s soul...	21.14801055692106
— Did you finish it?	14.288259027309165
he asked.	10.295735601437203
— Yes, she said.	10.2322797430686
There ’ s nothing smutty in it.	13.142525513471336
Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?	23.47200857150964
— Never read it.	15.5438544556921
Do you want another?	17.383783208334112
— Yes.	10.060020338761374
Get another of Paul de Kock ’ s.	10.721326662876033
Nice name he has.	20.44659635975034
She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.	12.855905974020269
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they ’ ll write to Kearney, my guarantor.	11.127781070021339
Reincarnation: that ’ s the word.	19.181754574727552
— Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before.	16.597353085692188
They call it reincarnation.	19.644663447117782
That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.	16.15955059068478
They say we have forgotten it.	18.163946270796927
Some say they remember their past lives.	12.300689928590858
The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea.	7.525691102823886
Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis.	20.32329154755493
An example would be better.	18.765817615629093
The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed.	20.182132134345753
Given away with the Easter number of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours.	10.031330594722336
Tea before you put milk in.	19.503814017210487
Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer.	16.727438453441813
Three and six I gave for the frame.	24.937906713589953
She said it would look nice over the bed.	19.82120618502966
Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.	16.87573874682261
He turned the pages back.	14.6098188985999
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance.	16.45038475017082
What they called nymphs, for example.	16.79871626163658
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar.	15.413640189896135
She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils.	11.258320979447559
— There ’ s a smell of burn, she said.	11.455539845182566
Did you leave anything on the fire?	24.81806848862417
— The kidney! he cried suddenly.	14.322658833906061
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork ’ s legs.	12.922826010893859
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan.	19.623526159290712
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.	14.192766664542928
Only a little burnt.	25.028946835177088
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.	12.266769978372277
Cup of tea now.	18.444585140970883
He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat.	16.247795920112072
Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat.	9.281831573805828
Done to a turn.	34.50780415808178
A mouthful of tea.	13.821630751695539
Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth.	13.589581792880969
What was that about some young student and a picnic?	20.343879359370195
He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.	16.094882146602497
Dearest Papli Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present.	17.138741157611207
It suits me splendid.	13.08418613936513
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam.	17.60264294509965
I got mummy ’ s lovely box of creams and am writing.	13.006602955627102
They are lovely.	19.41302706393402
I am getting on swimming in the photo business now.	16.05168436240837
Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs.	24.891674923247407
Will send when developed.	13.619309805490326
We did great biz yesterday.	11.857676309148813
Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in.	23.52153833179543
We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic.	13.78112327893366
Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks.	14.260753249566537
I hear them at the piano downstairs.	22.48335050005306
There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.	17.818413171627604
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan ’ s (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan ’ s) song about those seaside girls.	11.351400452390052
Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects.	9.284983350939111
I must now close with fondest love Your fond daughter Milly P.	6.953947861369788
S.	16.596153063908286
Excuse bad writing am in hurry.	10.968003289990294
M.	18.41939908880623
Fifteen yesterday.	23.14139757023239
Curious, fifteenth of the month too.	16.842074318022966
Her first birthday away from home.	14.980488374643324
Separation.	44.876532221709276
Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street.	10.895760216111416
Jolly old woman.	24.047123612713026
Lot of babies she must have helped into the world.	13.125540245670194
She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn ’ t live.	21.006779131088233
Well, God is good, sir.	16.879210437220227
She knew at once.	15.13998555881812
He would be eleven now if he had lived.	19.096627741092092
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript.	12.498317947776018
Excuse bad writing.	16.24815761864372
Hurry.	37.50114057555287
Piano downstairs.	21.12767966678429
Coming out of her shell.	29.064628500576884
Row with her in the XL Café about the bracelet.	21.770499558801248
Wouldn ’ t eat her cakes or speak or look.	10.293580002639509
Saucebox.	44.876532221709276
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney.	10.556110330493098
Twelve and six a week.	17.989842491833553
Not much.	23.256025138518712
Still, she might do worse.	18.107015104313135
Music hall stage.	17.471379072499175
Young student.	17.528190071851277
He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal.	10.062930835284185
Then he read the letter again: twice.	16.93227896940872
O, well: she knows how to mind herself.	16.009724648356865
But if not?	23.21933342174651
No, nothing has happened.	14.822402283799182
Wait in any case till it does.	15.761010174109618
A wild piece of goods.	15.490750337543883
Her slim legs running up the staircase.	13.117328220262383
Destiny.	35.61852722871305
Ripening now.	22.870672780332484
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window.	15.207947790338785
Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.	15.816827833943204
Anemic a little.	27.33828642148613
Was given milk too long.	15.855012605227861
Damned old tub pitching about.	9.715727992169166
Not a bit funky.	20.09232932949581
Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.	18.23250486494505
All dimpled cheeks and curls, Your head it simply swirls.	8.597634273018906
Seaside girls.	25.573823149855432
Torn envelope.	22.874596991303783
Hands stuck in his trousers ’ pockets, jarvey off for the day, singing.	19.54236599706652
Friend of the family.	42.24761998895355
Swurls, he says.	30.95453516406459
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.	10.602991057699864
Those girls, those girls, Those lovely seaside girls.	10.051791844469761
Milly too.	23.63143249096296
Young kisses: the first.	22.976407740484166
Far away now past.	15.567303130284282
Mrs Marion.	16.773210439704247
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.	12.454261235235787
A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing.	7.962684078774179
Will happen, yes.	14.168758637031859
Prevent.	44.876532221709276
Girl ’ s sweet light lips.	19.31459101227959
Will happen too.	16.432765610748707
He felt the flowing qualm spread over him.	9.487332389148712
Useless to move now.	16.431585485780243
Lips kissed, kissing, kissed.	14.020364477476809
Full gluey woman ’ s lips.	16.92841455519735
Better where she is down there: away.	19.112432315195687
Occupy her.	24.616345292208845
Wanted a dog to pass the time.	13.773446894304437
Might take a trip down there.	14.668049199797872
August bank holiday, only two and six return.	14.072669733602623
Six weeks off, however.	17.44369875177552
Might work a press pass.	15.92852910512236
Or through M ’ Coy.	13.419238555413502
The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door.	13.010718975526839
She looked back at him, mewing.	21.647484921026674
Wants to go out.	23.176817325526727
Wait before a door sometime it will open.	14.809361163198941
Let her wait.	16.93710917162839
Has the fidgets.	18.57354938072199
Electric.	44.25662045647404
Thunder in the air.	25.432436561154038
Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too.	24.587731278623814
He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels.	17.65478175713384
He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers.	12.654890625831163
The cat mewed to him.	11.954017823273347
— Miaow! he said in answer.	16.544632451140444
Wait till I ’ m ready.	15.690570203140085
Heaviness: hot day coming.	11.79780977030229
Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.	14.803801384123222
A paper.	23.164717520659906
He liked to read at stool.	15.412536690518943
Hope no ape comes knocking just as I ’ m.	11.228627990576173
In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_.	12.854951055732359
He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it.	15.200934008540234
The cat went up in soft bounds.	15.964493253767174
Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.	18.101636643986804
Listening, he heard her voice: — Come, come, pussy.	22.764010530012914
Come.	22.160365043217414
He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden.	17.587253646267026
No sound.	20.0159429854319
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.	15.29245121344562
The maid was in the garden.	23.78862997990513
Fine morning.	24.615868457528823
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.	10.074708573519093
Make a summerhouse here.	12.010180266156313
Scarlet runners.	23.507245565066654
Want to manure the whole place over, scabby soil.	9.713560748430053
A coat of liver of sulphur.	11.86504061274673
All soil like that without dung.	17.785525311376844
Household slops.	23.29473476946619
Loam, what is this that is?	28.845685101520917
The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing.	13.181569410359549
Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes.	15.66130524160966
Mulch of dung.	18.751561107430053
Best thing to clean ladies ’ kid gloves.	13.109862713505908
Dirty cleans.	20.802572096613048
Ashes too.	22.87299924979919
Reclaim the whole place.	20.323061574437922
Grow peas in that corner there.	18.315177772487015
Lettuce.	44.876532221709276
Always have fresh greens then.	10.725502751448358
Still gardens have their drawbacks.	12.122483451518844
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.	8.958297689420267
He walked on.	14.557967549932993
Where is my hat, by the way?	27.403493006163757
Must have put it back on the peg.	25.311195048440872
Or hanging up on the floor.	17.26829591641249
Funny I don ’ t remember that.	16.04686242997064
Hallstand too full.	17.353799604338267
Four umbrellas, her raincloak.	19.83090190662256
Picking up the letters.	25.045841223583725
Drago ’ s shopbell ringing.	24.09323972198613
Queer I was just thinking that moment.	17.091415724962932
Brown brillantined hair over his collar.	18.497510361247766
Just had a wash and brushup.	19.46165511607376
Wonder have I time for a bath this morning.	18.000038690592078
Tara street.	24.397080171763307
Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say.	12.051664489100146
O ’ Brien.	15.130669573520931
Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has.	15.92274389147423
Agendath what is it?	19.504359734876942
Now, my miss.	22.150463977722094
Enthusiast.	44.876532221709276
He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes.	17.691494377419033
Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral.	16.93719130107108
He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel.	18.792439824580896
Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces.	7.400895660121587
The king was in his countinghouse.	24.479923771828595
Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees.	15.832432103489703
Something new and easy.	16.397626815575098
No great hurry.	16.438383622799112
Keep it a bit.	22.680920118393164
Our prize titbit: _Matcham ’ s Masterstroke_.	14.455130528196406
Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers ’ Club, London.	9.437613863404223
Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer.	17.05830615574615
Three and a half.	26.74258734420253
Three pounds three.	18.36064379265284
Three pounds, thirteen and six.	11.092337409020143
Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second.	13.367325604270974
Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone.	10.339107536698833
Hope it ’ s not too big bring on piles again.	12.12841861955087
No, just right.	21.197366714354587
So. Ah! Costive.	13.913440609158483
One tabloid of cascara sagrada.	8.026252138553389
Life might be so.	25.980996831367772
It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat.	16.20111839849216
Print anything now.	16.523735357025913
Silly season.	23.29423965250343
He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell.	16.912463911171095
Neat certainly.	26.20688774398288
_Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now_.	14.725615264165322
Begins and ends morally.	11.891679147139376
_Hand in hand_.	14.698869664397591
Smart.	45.71905876676923
He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.	13.236562894145159
Might manage a sketch.	11.28537869273199
By Mr and Mrs L.	14.841940167886257
M.	18.41939908880623
Bloom.	18.279381378412623
Which?	39.407627932825726
Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said dressing.	15.974445600771205
Dislike dressing together.	16.467820085600195
Nicked myself shaving.	16.755849874151487
Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt.	9.703890942763225
Timing her.	24.616345292208845
<URL>.	24.997210943187593
Did Roberts pay you yet?	13.329986100887115
<URL>.	24.997210943187593
What had Gretta Conroy on?	11.229851198645262
What possessed me to buy this comb?	18.28939084401893
<URL>.	24.997210943187593
I ’ m swelled after that cabbage.	12.156774997804025
A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.	17.284457656574673
Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf.	9.505556467700494
Morning after the bazaar dance when May ’ s band played Ponchielli ’ s dance of the hours.	18.539868651019074
Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours.	16.78965873244618
Washing her teeth.	18.37185706843006
That was the first night.	19.67452657751847
Her fansticks clicking.	12.387470172988957
Is that Boylan well off?	14.227957537679078
He has money.	16.95950279733364
Why?	18.457368458488407
No use humming then.	13.239635097667422
Allude to it.	20.08269491734996
Strange kind of music that last night.	18.279278636673176
The mirror was in shadow.	23.467303770754377
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub.	9.16526273740042
Peering into it.	21.85590762386108
Lines in her eyes.	22.53951448244246
It wouldn ’ t pan out somehow.	14.821173089331685
Evening hours, girls in grey gauze.	14.4955313612407
Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks.	7.468001016487975
Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.	19.84051963601735
Still, true to life also.	13.89521383418543
Day: then the night.	22.87307137636609
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.	9.572297098654534
Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself.	10.214734365056055
He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.	15.212761706506493
In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees.	16.47700302459997
What time is the funeral?	23.786661789687262
Better find out in the paper.	25.641674050325733
The bells of George ’ s church.	15.209082490764796
They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.	11.154839491573908
Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Quarter to.	6.401599817213426
There again: the overtone following through the air.	16.651851818777228
A third.	25.342758861387008
Poor Dignam! By lorries along sir John Rogerson ’ s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past Windmill lane, Leask ’ s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office.	10.058045174189461
Could have given that address too.	13.635509183760572
And past the sailors ’ home.	15.037492364360228
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.	16.57996489334913
By Brady ’ s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt.	12.65520393745449
A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop.	9.263274867827123
Tell him if he smokes he won ’ t grow.	17.388157925307667
O let him! His life isn ’ t such a bed of roses.	21.629058957289367
Waiting outside pubs to bring da home.	10.617770485339065
Come home to ma, da.	15.835503858419735
Slack hour: won ’ t be many there.	13.489009518006355
He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel.	13.467652283201417
El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth.	13.16258066766639
And past Nichols ’ the undertaker.	9.970538880732462
At eleven it is.	15.96388891834499
Time enough.	18.922239652063745
Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O ’ Neill ’ s.	11.68030871298018
Corny.	40.37094843310022
Met her once in the park.	21.306565595156012
What a lark.	14.706573346831316
Police tout.	23.188828989019026
Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay.	10.943007327845647
O, surely he bagged it.	10.495142272910845
Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall.	19.774179458460246
With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.	8.335392095004202
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest quality, family tea.	8.145752131871811
Rather warm.	24.88667341897708
Tea.	32.20978324985897
Must get some from Tom Kernan.	12.089620279961114
Couldn ’ t ask him at a funeral, though.	20.89514740442065
While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair.	11.56271892672686
Very warm morning.	17.621919934823328
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha.	11.324148659259563
Just there.	24.30476838940286
His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat.	19.786786106398615
His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.	11.93115271099057
So warm.	24.83072549855104
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.	13.123473875552865
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands.	16.95002222219267
The far east.	15.68549173800687
Lovely spot it must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them.	9.734682480038353
Wonder is it like that.	22.09391991567975
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_, not doing a hand ’ s turn all day.	13.348455344802648
Sleep six months out of twelve.	20.92045792209019
Too hot to quarrel.	13.11476958561601
Influence of the climate.	44.99661409143395
Lethargy.	44.25662045647404
Flowers of idleness.	14.586525008053659
The air feeds most.	11.975735164481797
Azotes.	44.876532221709276
Hothouse in Botanic gardens.	11.89439234035016
Sensitive plants.	22.449694044988373
Waterlilies.	44.876532221709276
Petals too tired to.	15.6859449491112
Sleeping sickness in the air.	18.806534463988203
Walk on roseleaves.	15.33654687501278
Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel.	13.142060119479673
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere?	24.6564358061048
Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.	21.476361037355684
Couldn ’ t sink if you tried: so thick with salt.	12.921949963790643
Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what?	27.597522202680167
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight?	18.004451232001955
It ’ s a law something like that.	12.699255758593104
Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching.	8.313936793804578
The college curriculum.	14.718821527612949
Cracking curriculum.	20.802544016340633
What is weight really when you say the weight?	15.76254400891015
Thirtytwo feet per second per second.	12.530234620342553
Law of falling bodies: per second per second.	10.32530082991614
They all fall to the ground.	18.1495250659057
The earth.	21.591373678635854
It ’ s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.	18.5218171131471
He turned away and sauntered across the road.	11.456913875656014
How did she walk with her sausages?	19.512930006465346
Like that something.	21.26830798745598
As he walked he took the folded _Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.	11.969264143241013
Careless air: just drop in to see.	16.178163879237047
Per second per second.	13.468537792660221
Per second for every second it means.	13.56843748584038
From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice.	14.332750944368946
Too late box.	16.4212168735914
Post here.	24.652622483002215
In. He handed the card through the brass grill.	14.90820004110706
— Are there any letters for me?	14.71928126914347
he asked.	10.295735601437203
While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper.	10.253823201960856
No answer probably.	16.464001087024467
Went too far last time.	15.943406531264896
The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.	16.051873830706224
He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.	16.54744070827862
Henry Flower Esq, c / o P.	8.338712000002676
O.	16.57850871695433
Westland Row, City.	15.670626913310997
Answered anyhow.	22.05093943888609
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing again the soldiers on parade.	9.197150338289457
Where ’ s old Tweedy ’ s regiment?	21.837393453369966
Castoff soldier.	23.847751988494828
There: bearskin cap and hackle plume.	9.204130035354293
No, he ’ s a grenadier.	18.05616384535583
Pointed cuffs.	20.531908815027172
There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.	11.869744618412586
Redcoats.	44.876532221709276
Too showy.	20.024822024424243
That must be why the women go after them.	18.27616548191188
Uniform.	44.25662045647404
Easier to enlist and drill.	9.578834650239749
Maud Gonne ’ s letter about taking them off O ’ Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital.	13.848937285354177
Griffith ’ s paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover empire.	10.654989329485653
Half baked they look: hypnotised like.	10.734799921057899
Mark time.	24.711583170763497
Table: able.	17.280692950118485
Bed: ed.	14.710701146333635
The King ’ s own.	25.591134302001173
Never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby.	16.87784467366851
A mason, yes.	13.712711442434617
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right.	17.961733490235247
Talk: as if that would mend matters.	18.356105177169336
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.	15.099181923376069
Women will pay a lot of heed, I don ’ t think.	12.113461289795989
His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket.	12.355051983876336
Something pinned on: photo perhaps.	13.448728884416571
No. M ’ Coy.	13.392084733970092
Get rid of him quickly.	24.031306885691382
Take me out of my way.	23.798613064891697
Hate company when you.	17.355776521693382
— Hello, Bloom.	11.926391744242121
Where are you off to?	24.055825233933884
— Hello, M ’ Coy.	11.371785511542896
Nowhere in particular.	18.706018897013706
— How ’ s the body?	21.386740605372957
— Fine.	22.509907397152553
How are you?	17.359533389663554
— Just keeping alive, M ’ Coy said.	8.736798614421742
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect: — Is there any...	15.403694026006368
— O, no, Mr Bloom said.	12.484424525985713
Poor Dignam, you know.	22.37630747380148
The funeral is today.	13.043299817978582
— To be sure, poor fellow.	15.915068167398434
So it is.	18.52607114258475
What time?	22.435164966820327
A photo it isn ’ t.	11.367536235566643
A badge maybe.	15.780907222041803
— E... eleven, Mr Bloom answered.	21.653062723646144
— I must try to get out there, M ’ Coy said.	15.759892120758538
Eleven, is it?	21.790788353652523
I only heard it last night.	15.709580023562236
Who was telling me?	16.24115976935368
Holohan.	48.9929530895421
You know Hoppy?	17.367864843009166
— I know.	11.709414658442789
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor.	18.89349864670351
The porter hoisted the valise up on the well.	14.990004271584121
She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change.	16.16664696325377
Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth.	15.495065100929255
Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets.	20.306702661617
Like that haughty creature at the polo match.	14.28369688359319
Women all for caste till you touch the spot.	14.104299111245924
Handsome is and handsome does.	12.737907154558162
Reserved about to yield.	20.543730912395844
The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man.	10.606255978014362
Possess her once take the starch out of her.	14.112379171235629
— I was with Bob Doran, he ’ s on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons.	17.855154850036975
Just down there in Conway ’ s we were.	21.745785102581824
Doran Lyons in Conway ’ s.	11.834225776407111
She raised a gloved hand to her hair.	17.140208322010235
In came Hoppy.	16.827416143347822
Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums.	14.254721907723454
Clearly I can see today.	20.036722576074812
Moisture about gives long sight perhaps.	9.95194472712635
Talking of one thing or another.	17.731369809131188
Lady ’ s hand.	26.712828953798258
Which side will she get up?	13.900907762838617
— And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy? _ I said.	12.243506161931494
_Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.	10.73347873653417
High brown boots with laces dangling.	11.211650300362038
Wellturned foot.	24.20300660779254
What is he foostering over that change for?	12.810693467865423
Sees me looking.	19.337643096929035
Eye out for other fellow always.	21.675603064119464
Good fallback.	20.84988287086897
Two strings to her bow.	20.64709092532933
— _Why? _ I said.	16.960052825116936
_What ’ s wrong with him? _ I said.	27.943843364875995
Proud: rich: silk stockings.	10.028861052901613
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	8.254277600571053
He moved a little to the side of M ’ Coy ’ s talking head.	20.204112020405155
Getting up in a minute.	26.741401775568402
— _What ’ s wrong with him_?	17.10014068618498
He said.	15.426797471686637
_He ’ s dead_, he said.	17.212654730454176
And, faith, he filled up.	20.563103114090985
_Is it Paddy Dignam_?	14.779269813317498
I said.	15.532206160218417
I couldn ’ t believe it when I heard it.	19.3078480438685
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch.	14.923713905535543
_Yes, _ he said.	17.659918070973237
_He ’ s gone.	24.921637677154905
He died on Monday, poor fellow_.	16.26922166616449
Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white.	9.052749187112324
Watch! A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.	8.66417220136675
Lost it.	23.93593938048365
Curse your noisy pugnose.	12.705754236368271
Feels locked out of it.	16.13872327155925
Paradise and the peri.	33.08971307665593
Always happening like that.	15.264463979384772
The very moment.	17.623179794307894
Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter.	9.438487305283692
Her friend covering the display of.	10.613072363376206
_Esprit de corps_.	14.644097362207432
Well, what are you gaping at?	23.271994469615493
Another gone.	23.459043209495572
— One of the best, M ’ Coy said.	13.498883122941965
The tram passed.	17.558184595841674
They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip.	14.190010816846163
Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick.	15.027196367509193
— Wife well, I suppose?	22.387735384204937
M ’ Coy ’ s changed voice said.	14.70320303564666
— O, yes, Mr Bloom said.	10.615540359146976
Tiptop, thanks.	17.736531723110563
He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly: What is home without Plumtree ’ s Potted Meat?	10.1096750102816
Incomplete.	31.115649569681647
With it an abode of bliss.	8.218008024401522
— My missus has just got an engagement.	10.066464756657693
At least it ’ s not settled yet.	16.29084837056334
Valise tack again.	15.551932162315042
By the way no harm.	14.942786841213007
I ’ m off that, thanks.	14.682063822907464
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.	8.855370779075361
— My wife too, he said.	14.570510384891517
She ’ s going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.	16.237420779620518
— That so?	13.53697205495797
M ’ Coy said.	9.545025922112828
Glad to hear that, old man.	23.966305503619445
Who ’ s getting it up?	20.340546759749973
Mrs Marion Bloom.	15.22628311121149
Not up yet.	16.74767924654869
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.	22.690412165006983
No book.	24.459323173116776
Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.	7.480045431673466
Dark lady and fair man.	13.13503875837709
Letter.	43.11253835167618
Cat furry black ball.	12.798776653426103
Torn strip of envelope.	13.941537256757512
Love ’ s Old Sweet Song Comes lo - ove ’ s old...	11.45974008618605
— It ’ s a kind of a tour, don ’ t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.	14.491988607484453
_Sweeeet song_.	19.698768402221454
There ’ s a committee formed.	13.959496361671457
Part shares and part profits.	9.115497230299336
M ’ Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.	13.498047463827413
— O, well, he said.	12.548905516959806
That ’ s good news.	14.059633542397302
He moved to go.	18.11632100888359
— Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said.	11.249245944655334
Meet you knocking around.	13.61335140530824
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	8.254277600571053
— Tell you what, M ’ Coy said.	10.499170615340091
You might put down my name at the funeral, will you?	18.93423143063442
I ’ d like to go but I mightn ’ t be able, you see.	15.907218410554393
There ’ s a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found.	12.9350042829426
You just shove in my name if I ’ m not there, will you?	18.57752956803338
— I ’ ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off.	15.232833441895593
That ’ ll be all right.	10.918345480107986
— Right, M ’ Coy said brightly.	11.200751497734421
Thanks, old man.	18.01788244321364
I ’ d go if I possibly could.	15.518643672660774
Well, tolloll.	16.380816873696254
Just C.	21.95113472186725
P.	13.98068437666092
M ’ Coy will do.	14.0919627608597
— That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.	15.582066855313544
Didn ’ t catch me napping that wheeze.	10.241031700730163
The quick touch.	17.04705885112845
Soft mark.	24.494892289933055
I ’ d like my job.	15.099450046361026
Valise I have a particular fancy for.	19.305586336124794
Leather.	44.876532221709276
Capped corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock.	6.8105686157325245
Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this.	15.82217650101568
Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled.	11.556186512419112
My missus has just got an.	11.559225937373606
Reedy freckled soprano.	12.979579786729156
Cheeseparing nose.	23.316904601311954
Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad.	22.884237186575007
No guts in it.	17.605050486684743
You and me, don ’ t you know: in the same boat.	18.43255897140307
Softsoaping.	44.876532221709276
Give you the needle that would.	17.753093354986003
Can ’ t he hear the difference?	16.49313326215761
Think he ’ s that way inclined a bit.	20.227126948234982
Against my grain somehow.	12.590031313013833
Thought that Belfast would fetch him.	9.855279424672672
I hope that smallpox up there doesn ’ t get worse.	12.135379877342753
Suppose she wouldn ’ t let herself be vaccinated again.	10.113786758015996
Your wife and my wife.	24.203506294385882
Wonder is he pimping after me?	17.14761646178661
Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings.	18.91090170946893
Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s Ginger Ale (Aromatic).	10.04972516178093
Clery ’ s Summer Sale.	21.54373399867906
No, he ’ s going on straight.	18.64776878306733
Hello.	26.268180599479532
_Leah_ tonight.	25.346297632045008
Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	13.478831036895363
_Hamlet_ she played last night.	13.282467653511038
Male impersonator.	23.507245565066654
Perhaps he was a woman.	26.14723742224608
Why Ophelia committed suicide.	11.719758987499727
Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that.	11.580780222995184
Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.	14.185762100698778
Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.	24.97933336771848
And Ristori in Vienna.	11.342670383232695
What is this the right name is?	20.091468998338435
By Mosenthal it is.	14.578678336727405
No. The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.	14.89278618545374
Nathan ’ s voice! His son ’ s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father.	20.23993676742186
Poor papa! Poor man! I ’ m glad I didn ’ t go into the room to look at his face.	15.159538560462419
That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.	16.50295577216528
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.	16.48606662825384
No use thinking of it any more.	21.0947926283331
Nosebag time.	23.247828479675928
Wish I hadn ’ t met that M ’ Coy fellow.	11.977056919018212
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth.	10.782256034810398
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss.	11.740814769167216
Their Eldorado.	20.599264987653253
Poor jugginses! Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags.	10.125964849208701
Too full for words.	12.886144146698422
Still they get their feed all right and their doss.	17.957338106951156
Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches.	12.443911555805869
Might be happy all the same that way.	16.585136045952943
Good poor brutes they look.	13.626540088265658
Still their neigh can be very irritating.	10.156058429793674
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried.	16.819666954447097
Might just walk into her here.	13.984778136256011
The lane is safer.	12.15090676831475
He passed the cabman ’ s shelter.	18.299552580361507
Curious the life of drifting cabbies.	11.637030712033148
All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.	13.606579083530365
_Voglio e non_.	14.110868922769024
Like to give them an odd cigarette.	16.223229378727137
Sociable.	44.876532221709276
Shout a few flying syllables as they pass.	15.459822360221212
He hummed: Là ci darem la mano La la lala la la.	5.72159303344637
He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall.	19.223083403100407
No - one.	13.350669055543468
Meade ’ s timberyard.	32.80363649382704
Piled balks.	19.698757934423995
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone.	10.280249222772127
Not a sinner.	18.604261369188485
Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.	8.243191806040969
A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill.	12.727866857791959
Pity to disturb them.	14.244222399900494
Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.	18.13833412332404
Open it.	24.278331742276652
And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame ’ s school.	17.745462185467964
She liked mignonette.	15.046133835248515
Mrs Ellis ’ s.	15.02963102416475
And Mr?	24.36860490268973
He opened the letter within the newspaper.	19.389410565101088
A flower.	25.066498290001277
I think it ’ s a.	18.18277195611789
Not annoyed then?	16.138909351673437
What does she say?	19.76042853491434
Dear Henry I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.	15.962928786994336
I am sorry you did not like my last letter.	17.473796993830963
Why did you enclose the stamps?	12.549661421010352
I am awfully angry with you.	11.820830334192259
I do wish I could punish you for that.	16.4182997091682
I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world.	11.991135664996499
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word?	21.00413758213689
I do wish I could do something for you.	16.811798258588986
Please tell me what you think of poor me.	20.394709413929682
I often think of the beautiful name you have.	21.537356482752557
Dear Henry, when will we meet?	18.559596336508314
I think of you so often you have no idea.	20.210747078430433
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you.	16.258275597404822
Please write me a long letter and tell me more.	19.451939015300702
Remember if you do not I will punish you.	22.993902822109845
So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.	23.528010621285567
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted.	11.18757960102777
Then I will tell you all.	16.56174539414098
Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache.	20.089844218139277
today.	33.74082447478886
and write _by return_ to your longing Martha P.	7.747922939907067
S.	16.596153063908286
Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.	13.933530711238777
I want to know.	15.054811803400995
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket.	9.986221417688437
They like it because no - one can hear.	15.711499306756549
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down.	11.129306111392244
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word.	14.969486423153262
Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don ’ t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha ’ s perfume.	7.457706443193976
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.	23.38229512284336
Weak joy opened his lips.	13.552631312672172
Changed since the first letter.	26.589332589438893
Wonder did she wrote it herself.	17.190215914660335
Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me, respectable character.	15.196505012987592
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.	13.842947066615093
Thank you: not having any.	16.532016777508094
Usual love scrimmage.	15.797925646994074
Then running round corners.	14.9902474397345
Bad as a row with Molly.	21.933867258229114
Cigar has a cooling effect.	15.78290170825335
Narcotic.	44.876532221709276
Go further next time.	14.071990838194045
Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.	12.861560295125159
Brutal, why not?	19.58852412310239
A bit at a time.	18.197003403000814
Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.	17.655520684859674
Common pin, eh?	15.496774114681465
He threw it on the road.	20.633283082318894
Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together.	13.659008855262583
Queer the number of pins they always have.	12.587178226442164
No roses without thorns.	12.952757855418799
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head.	13.367214315056104
Those two sluts that night in the Coombe, linked together in the rain.	17.901047930676693
O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.	13.227197537274204
She didn ’ t know what to do To keep it up, To keep it up.	11.790807835427906
It?	36.346100222244225
Them.	47.24847640620578
Such a bad headache.	15.418377103959095
Has her roses probably.	12.961077512897809
Or sitting all day typing.	15.140438838351743
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves.	12.903901014744415
What perfume does your wife use.	10.160504420019485
Now could you make out a thing like that?	20.662923716161337
To keep it up.	12.360851024154318
Martha, Mary.	23.917115743689337
I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money.	9.356392884459382
He is sitting in their house, talking.	24.04078907147512
Mysterious.	44.25662045647404
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.	20.017403405835065
To keep it up.	12.360851024154318
Nice kind of evening feeling.	20.817274750291748
No more wandering about.	14.354044250896996
Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip.	8.922934572938322
Forget.	43.11253835167618
Tell about places you have been, strange customs.	13.527006162756562
The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown.	14.453052478013667
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches.	17.767521412190437
She listens with big dark soft eyes.	10.482315002594836
Tell her: more and more: all.	17.134945611974963
Then a sigh: silence.	12.892117750157343
Long long long rest.	18.080466323561186
Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road.	11.161911235246837
The shreds fluttered away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.	16.58030557161065
Henry Flower.	24.378358098497923
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way.	20.183655674960328
Simple bit of paper.	25.203926866306926
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland.	12.319372708171807
Shows you the money to be made out of porter.	28.585379888873053
Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day, they say.	12.884419779800687
Skin breeds lice or vermin.	9.572286276721503
A million pounds, wait a moment.	14.25001273783617
Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.	9.352031943177183
One and four into twenty: fifteen about.	10.243802559924072
Yes, exactly.	19.240153841491022
Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.	13.61780851105107
What am I saying barrels?	15.650057181960996
Gallons.	44.876532221709276
About a million barrels all the same.	15.043356545461677
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.	8.988932835050377
Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.	9.823692167255343
The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.	9.581783354403466
He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.	11.160595837124617
Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband.	16.119990836999577
Damn it.	23.167224390146362
I might have tried to work M ’ Coy for a pass to Mullingar.	17.33159733004865
Same notice on the door.	22.15321149331888

Prefer an ounce of opium.	10.950919551531705
Celestials.	44.876532221709276
Rank heresy for them.	12.796527426907682
Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum.	22.291860689277033
Taking it easy with hand under his cheek.	13.93942335766509
Not like Ecce Homo.	10.381550645457999
Crown of thorns and cross.	11.364307575542178
Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.	11.650411077516017
Chopsticks?	44.75790071189311
Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.	14.597216008357975
Sorry I didn ’ t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn ’ t.	12.125650599411186
He ’ s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he?	14.110816486275048
The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.	12.402556738630867
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening.	13.650375262893178
Still life.	23.06956998354619
Lap it up like milk, I suppose.	23.012800262577745
The cold smell of sacred stone called him.	11.737171515717268
He trod the worn steps, pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.	10.688522833529392
Something going on: some sodality.	17.609752613309848
Pity so empty.	17.441329842134156
Nice discreet place to be next some girl.	16.48251923074679
Who is my neighbour?	24.50989036000167
Jammed by the hour to slow music.	20.710244665674356
That woman at midnight mass.	15.430595189737819
Seventh heaven.	25.88620841443428
Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed.	10.171738099114837
A batch knelt at the altarrails.	17.796722905923144
The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands.	17.967990194099286
He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth.	12.783836966599832
Her hat and head sank.	18.744003976795174
Then the next one.	15.911354122489053
Her hat sank at once.	12.59857883522482
Then the next one: a small old woman.	20.31819347899202
The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time.	17.963295440037278
Latin.	47.012915661452354
The next one.	18.26923860705868
Shut your eyes and open your mouth.	13.655954640753732
What?	14.617951109062046
_Corpus: _ body.	34.20920721253454
Corpse.	43.669601723859934
Good idea the Latin.	14.06967585386222
Stupefies them first.	18.770957925590857
They don ’ t seem to chew it: only swallow it down.	11.571864846448783
Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse.	18.33102477970324
Why the cannibals cotton to it.	8.832068564879377
He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, and seek their places.	11.958278579873337
He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper.	12.85143152349841
These pots we have to wear.	18.799266465758368
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads.	12.609812417739988
They were about him here and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs.	16.72120745683314
Something like those mazzoth: it ’ s that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.	12.721831424412889
Look at them.	20.450590937356903
Now I bet it makes them feel happy.	13.212592782980103
Lollipop.	44.876532221709276
It does.	23.07349477149042
Yes, bread of angels it ’ s called.	16.71437033401707
There ’ s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel.	15.887110995416236
Hokypoky penny a lump.	14.975294505242678
Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim.	18.471165457583435
They do.	23.96466424574565
I ’ m sure of that.	12.65937576057961
Not so lonely.	18.791038322342224
In our confraternity.	16.175329337909577
Then come out a bit spreeish.	26.149886855784985
Let off steam.	17.633326217051835
Thing is if you really believe in it.	15.90849272185694
Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.	11.464343562174417
Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox.	9.924632649735567
Hence those snores.	14.70427493127871
Blind faith.	21.779228720348474
Safe in the arms of kingdom come.	20.72125041643258
Lulls all pain.	16.338704963939353
Wake this time next year.	17.219402622550778
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on.	14.750523597444326
Suppose he lost the pin of his.	14.324204992874561
He wouldn ’ t know what to do to.	15.667788943825483
Bald spot behind.	17.295332244570442
Letters on his back: <URL>	41.8010153315397
I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is.	17.945317715030292
And the other one?	23.493533873582045
Iron nails ran in.	13.70859342098525
Meet one Sunday after the rosary.	14.495003031731775
Do not deny my request.	11.748049102401094
Dusk and the light behind her.	33.20842124700612
She might be here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly.	24.173106747484614
Their character.	22.95308291425879
That fellow that turned queen ’ s evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning.	17.12335342611386
This very church.	17.753455276873396
Peter Carey, yes.	15.630640799836288
No, Peter Claver I am thinking of.	16.80604460474761
Denis Carey.	26.004979055962085
And just imagine that.	16.49406833055156
Wife and six children at home.	14.602207245740713
And plotting that murder all the time.	11.116615247654854
Those crawthumpers, now that ’ s a good name for them, there ’ s always something shiftylooking about them.	17.082672725890244
They ’ re not straight men of business either.	11.818377823714775
O, no, she ’ s not here: the flower: no, no.	23.001285106450577
By the way, did I tear up that envelope?	17.32038413197127
Yes: under the bridge.	21.923803757737097
The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly.	12.778221636636447
Wine.	37.50114057555287
Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness ’ s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley ’ s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s ginger ale (aromatic).	11.53856665851991
Doesn ’ t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.	15.7404716030807
Cold comfort.	24.058651348657875
Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they ’ d have one old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink.	9.675600481061645
Queer the whole atmosphere of the.	18.574919644830626
Quite right.	17.76721585187311
Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir.	19.98569554433264
Not going to be any music.	20.450989260188315
Pity.	30.820763982103497
Who has the organ here I wonder?	20.98988727200384
Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street.	13.187950367918143
Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat Mater_ of Rossini.	19.42050907836899
Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s sermon first.	15.928329619395056
Christ or Pilate?	18.30573482768764
Christ, but don ’ t keep us all night over it.	19.065995266433323
Music they wanted.	20.421139535269216
Footdrill stopped.	22.38350869599901
Could hear a pin drop.	14.529499786987675
I told her to pitch her voice against that corner.	12.119690020769859
I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up: _Quis est <URL> Some of that old sacred music splendid.	17.212246254450182
Mercadante: seven last words.	12.297428951535235
Mozart ’ s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that.	14.68916156148847
Those old popes keen on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds.	11.281195721259014
They had a gay old time while it lasted.	13.409329834717235
Healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs.	14.11143522507337
Benedictine.	44.876532221709276
Green Chartreuse.	21.965512940400078
Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.	20.85733616515344
What kind of voice is it?	22.709278290648808
Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.	12.56042931012069
Connoisseurs.	44.876532221709276
Suppose they wouldn ’ t feel anything after.	14.330539087802881
Kind of a placid.	27.550033446160764
No worry.	20.681248270675393
Fall into flesh, don ’ t they?	13.215386676406697
Gluttons, tall, long legs.	14.340213401262986
Who knows?	21.69601980486003
One way out of it.	18.02732719270479
He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people.	15.795575209660923
All crossed themselves and stood up.	14.186136540447361
Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats.	20.30173923376858
Stand up at the gospel of course.	21.572414644778526
Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench.	18.182823494873226
The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin.	18.68390120198556
Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card: — O God, our refuge and our strength...	16.544049866570234
Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words.	16.62763380148993
English.	45.129042601944455
Throw them the bone.	20.567611179122764
I remember slightly.	19.136957917317392
How long since your last mass?	14.436560138454121
Glorious and immaculate virgin.	12.320116249543451
Joseph, her spouse.	25.51087728848144
Peter and Paul.	18.34009853085752
More interesting if you understood what it was all about.	21.768719947363998
Wonderful organisation certainly, goes like clockwork.	8.54699970882578
Confession.	44.876532221709276
Everyone wants to.	21.06406670956524
Then I will tell you all.	16.56174539414098
Penance.	44.25662045647404
Punish me, please.	26.67192001597187
Great weapon in their hands.	20.554897851901263
More than doctor or solicitor.	11.983545614045967
Woman dying to.	23.131451675165422
And I schschschschschsch.	14.503548838559663
And did you chachachachacha?	19.14502357438384
And why did you?	22.13857254303187
Whispering gallery walls have ears.	10.676896030910477
Husband learn to his surprise.	26.307838945285262
God ’ s little joke.	21.377943657691816
Then out she comes.	13.742701437776795

Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they work the whole show.	14.3534989875928
And don ’ t they rake in the money too?	20.520113273241822

Masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.	17.709087767696754
Monasteries and convents.	14.687990481940115
No browbeating him.	14.59111738506635
He had his answer pat for everything.	11.570427563307824
The doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.	16.728526077921487
The priest prayed: — Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict.	11.276443582604843
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.	14.799236623223408
The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off.	20.45949963968684
All over.	24.335482395947704
The women remained behind: thanksgiving.	11.687334921281627
Brother Buzz.	23.643922779176467
Come around with the plate perhaps.	22.309056668189296
Pay your Easter duty.	13.658010026563586
He stood up.	13.593560711760057
Hello.	26.268180599479532
Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time?	17.47394414122267
Women enjoy it.	16.85197671292604
Never tell you.	19.512802674224293
But we.	23.7793026896676
Excuse, miss, there ’ s a (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff.	12.529272906314308
Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.	10.612015361213064
Glimpses of the moon.	29.88642639291636
Annoyed if you don ’ t.	15.120785889497567
Why didn ’ t you tell me before.	17.53576687919159
Still like you better untidy.	15.62544007293512
Good job it wasn ’ t farther south.	14.21655775153322
He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into the light.	13.543621716205635
He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water.	12.566367058171155
Trams: a car of Prescott ’ s dyeworks: a widow in her weeds.	20.614761035830735
Notice because I ’ m in mourning myself.	16.071137189291
He covered himself.	18.753593484462076
How goes the time?	20.059217791487736
Quarter past.	25.595940526222297
Time enough yet.	16.693955052131688
Better get that lotion made up.	17.197024494773753
Ah yes, the last time.	23.914648661410883
Sweny ’ s in Lincoln place.	20.162403792491705

He walked southward along Westland row.	9.636352962021185
But the recipe is in the other trousers.	19.59506131950923
O, and I forgot that latchkey too.	16.280491586446516
Bore this funeral affair.	13.088635816570582
O well, poor fellow, it ’ s not his fault.	21.822913239057446
When was it I got it made up last?	23.530639019828644
Wait.	16.144754643793675
I changed a sovereign I remember.	13.331911591995903
First of the month it must have been or the second.	24.209351370098382
O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.	20.59289730147036
The chemist turned back page after page.	11.095868283024243
Sandy shrivelled smell he seems to have.	12.301400015057228

He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs.	12.011644591183165
Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains.	9.812043864313003
— Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then orangeflower water...	9.937938236837645
It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.	9.810057846485535
— And white wax also, he said.	9.705055336992453
Brings out the darkness of her eyes.	25.47418223312573
Looking at me, the sheet up to her eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my cuffs.	18.686748036685675
Skinfood.	44.876532221709276
One of the old queen ’ s sons, duke of Albany was it?	16.01469673339467
had only one skin.	14.684478074771818
Leopold, yes.	24.586620303662023
Three we have.	25.269976390168438
Warts, bunions and pimples to make it worse.	11.04697593249504
But you want a perfume too.	15.287490070996562
What perfume does your?	14.16495304644762
_Peau d ’ Espagne_.	17.563760416313524
That orangeflower water is so fresh.	16.777413795348863
Nice smell these soaps have.	11.485416647014356
Pure curd soap.	14.312258932368088
Time to get a bath round the corner.	17.926684981527973
Hammam.	44.876532221709276
Turkish.	41.97666705394844
Massage.	44.876532221709276
Dirt gets rolled up in your navel.	19.563800767173213
Nicer if a nice girl did it.	17.310934503075696
Also I think I.	21.638278102116313
Yes I.	23.44061177252578
Do it in the bath.	26.207929566299608
Curious longing I.	16.86296060735964
Water to water.	16.906446745554042
Combine business with pleasure.	16.375923632750037
Pity no time for massage.	16.610056259157187
Feel fresh then all the day.	19.763797464227554
Funeral be rather glum.	12.461955204216885
That was two and nine.	15.623392698265473
Have you brought a bottle?	18.32716713579769
— No, Mr Bloom said.	9.646542549648625
Make it up, please.	23.013730698473175
I ’ ll call later in the day and I ’ ll take one of these soaps.	17.94007926800937
— Fourpence, sir.	11.753087221863588
Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils.	14.640052042984006
Sweet lemony wax.	14.701594607047475
— I ’ ll take this one, he said.	10.820478550443378
That makes three and a penny.	21.393017756154638
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	13.286878358652435
You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.	17.81174376209828
— Good, Mr Bloom said.	11.306060887686007
He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.	19.616695258611234
At his armpit Bantam Lyons ’ voice and hand said: — Hello, Bloom.	13.10369926277133
What ’ s the best news?	13.685112498248555
Is that today ’ s?	20.82541067851663
Show us a minute.	22.56308002144515
Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip.	14.044884413394966
He does look balmy.	13.561453011839673
Younger than I am.	19.410067024444782
Bantam Lyons ’ s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton.	11.81942325236609
Wants a wash too.	15.227265820404805
Take off the rough dirt.	20.345978426572547
Good morning, have you used Pears ’ soap?	12.81326970800752
Dandruff on his shoulders.	26.89014406244712
Scalp wants oiling.	14.601428596074184
— I want to see about that French horse that ’ s running today, Bantam Lyons said.	13.626148076198499
Where the bugger is it?	12.79886011564546
He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.	9.425460114960016
Barber ’ s itch.	36.439253667617756
Tight collar he ’ ll lose his hair.	17.045465474232252
Better leave him the paper and get shut of him.	18.209637770367294
— You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.	13.155127276002135
— Ascot.	23.60915676589556
Gold cup.	20.479050251173224
Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered.	13.19545287623673
Half a mo.	17.572892226061683
Maximum the second.	23.669371461832448
— I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.	12.212671276892568
Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.	12.486284612975123
— What ’ s that?	11.872792500682896
his sharp voice said.	7.008637958370011
— I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered.	18.75194651199963
I was going to throw it away that moment.	15.008033131184142
Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom ’ s arms.	11.566894848654348
— I ’ ll risk it, he said.	11.290709084492812
Here, thanks.	18.491901517171865
He sped off towards Conway ’ s corner.	12.690878507511373
God speed scut.	14.53095638106917
Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it, smiling.	14.237779090866834
Silly lips of that chap.	28.600709109782603
Betting.	44.25662045647404
Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence.	13.499627110423607
Raffle for large tender turkey.	10.880422005902627
Your Christmas dinner for threepence.	10.905347482899941
Jack Fleming embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America.	7.253866208371976
Keeps a hotel now.	13.223806356105825
They never come back.	16.984210389465563
Fleshpots of Egypt.	21.50436050584204
He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths.	18.219405500701182
Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets.	16.755261052943855
He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot.	11.501855793210094
Damn bad ad.	17.217135752794352
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.	23.56761266979447
Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.	8.714195089797336
Something to catch the eye.	14.780429820864127
There ’ s Hornblower standing at the porter ’ s lodge.	20.993163872892026
Keep him on hands: might take a turn in there on the nod.	17.96348631926708
How do you do, Mr Hornblower?	19.396608808787615
How do you do, sir?	15.544974736307777
Heavenly weather really.	16.531857303955327
If life was always like that.	18.504001371530222
Cricket weather.	23.05534128229531
Sit around under sunshades.	12.850710677365397
Over after over.	18.274069253331106
Out.	30.186877980577535
They can ’ t play it here.	14.532410232622357
Duck for six wickets.	13.438431905482007
Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg.	11.62702047731976
Donnybrook fair more in their line.	21.690826895998857
And the skulls we were acracking when M ’ Carthy took the floor.	11.499920185981322
Heatwave.	44.876532221709276
Won ’ t last.	24.69034368162297
Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.	15.231363044049683
Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream.	12.375797438550554
This is my body.	22.91452791397299
He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.	10.62333476665871
He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.	10.19433404990888
Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.	12.23215256363553
— Come on, Simon.	13.67078125275264
— After you, Mr Bloom said.	13.409991135134014
Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying: — Yes, yes.	15.183937499083463
— Are we all here now?	16.864081461370674
Martin Cunningham asked.	13.406050718810354
Come along, Bloom.	18.973851241571822
Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place.	18.910491383031093
He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight.	12.80553425464723
He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue.	15.894500505766967
One dragged aside: an old woman peeping.	14.432689278064645
Thanking her stars she was passed over.	18.0824223369393
Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.	17.960844322960362
Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming.	13.030942019248066
Job seems to suit them.	14.926597243813578
Huggermugger in corners.	15.510040770071248
Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he ’ d wake.	14.410871150775606
Then getting it ready.	15.712142790075609
Laying it out.	22.1427153586439
Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed.	15.211337633561042
Pull it more to your side.	21.130211320551396
Our windingsheet.	21.272490928770367
Never know who will touch you dead.	13.12011024492293
Wash and shampoo.	14.688007725642022
I believe they clip the nails and the hair.	16.035998438032813
Keep a bit in an envelope.	23.379054819240302
Grows all the same after.	27.0006531738481
Unclean job.	22.958870571959263
All waited.	19.874339711088787
Nothing was said.	17.964919848490446
Stowing in the wreaths probably.	27.355097968314112
I am sitting on something hard.	12.718328806439912
Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket.	22.300780912520406
Better shift it out of that.	16.82444602832806
Wait for an opportunity.	23.76446049490053
All waited.	19.874339711088787
Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses ’ hoofs.	12.061072943962488
A jolt.	22.408282809882227
Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.	12.894676883223863
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind.	9.658621226989311
The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.	9.893169125074122
At walking pace.	19.203044079388597
They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks.	15.002846781045427
Tritonville road.	25.672447534810182
Quicker.	44.25662045647404
The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.	13.72447278043329
— What way is he taking us?	15.993659230800004
Mr Power asked through both windows.	10.871476571249566
— Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said.	8.892155559754903
Ringsend.	50.80012333568969
Brunswick street.	27.21840453314187
Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.	15.079624501832999
— That ’ s a fine old custom, he said.	9.835754622950104
I am glad to see it has not died out.	16.160130126768664
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.	8.42539013172307
Respect.	47.24847640620578
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane.	12.357089880003526
Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.	13.836463515544137
— There ’ s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.	12.70926593266019
— Who is that?	15.307702887882716
— Your son and heir.	15.053524908762007
— Where is he?	15.752669229407468
Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.	11.923032758672656
The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.	8.857350612696077
Mr Dedalus fell back, saying: — Was that Mulligan cad with him?	16.305747210771823
His _fidus Achates_! — No, Mr Bloom said.	11.547407430800206
— Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa ’ s little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.	13.702064280675026
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road.	8.465749717201078
Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.	10.643552252250588
Richie Goulding and the legal bag.	26.2927431267174
Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm.	10.306699370596162
His jokes are getting a bit damp.	14.722723935970606
Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady ’ s two hats pinned on his head.	14.965008350356724
Out on the rampage all night.	19.815001255903233
Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear.	23.01202126584324
Wife ironing his back.	14.89542199720819
Thinks he ’ ll cure it with pills.	19.184618354655832
All breadcrumbs they are.	14.34346426976629
About six hundred per cent profit.	12.336976305746736
— He ’ s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.	16.068141741341112
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts.	11.142040560087883
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I ’ ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.	16.197049630910527
I ’ ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.	8.5104201063064
He cried above the clatter of the wheels: — I won ’ t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son.	15.162908497251308
A counterjumper ’ s son.	17.994224428371965
Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M ’ Swiney ’ s.	12.536075067900843
Not likely.	20.34293284161555
He ceased.	23.106632582853127
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power ’ s mild face and Martin Cunningham ’ s eyes and beard, gravely shaking.	15.985596730033043
Noisy selfwilled man.	15.167216417704436
Full of his son.	31.709580204500735
He is right.	17.89412160576637
Something to hand on.	21.544577417473352
If little Rudy had lived.	14.057787927896184
See him grow up.	13.755786494492561
Hear his voice in the house.	24.402462219264244
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit.	13.653444693889062
My son.	23.295429754454744
Me in his eyes.	24.773379026296013
Strange feeling it would be.	18.59923852844586
From me.	24.166859890269862
Just a chance.	18.443295121134373
Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil.	19.632797700094418
And the sergeant grinning up.	10.850716517213458
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched.	14.289884606727757
Give us a touch, Poldy.	15.519326468653217
God, I ’ m dying for it.	15.16677757748297
How life begins.	17.693562404339296
Got big then.	17.506343270702065
Had to refuse the Greystones concert.	8.69588330807966
My son inside her.	16.679078943529735
I could have helped him on in life.	17.035820522409754
I could.	18.632541701945957
Make him independent.	19.575609542771385
Learn German too.	15.429430609518917
— Are we late?	14.289145276970867
Mr Power asked.	15.20384830605139
— Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.	15.182622306170824
Molly.	27.933989065870424
Milly.	36.494839736419124
Same thing watered down.	11.885356177676405
Her tomboy oaths.	15.120040476276738
O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she ’ s a dear girl.	11.067505884911098
Soon be a woman.	26.20843682785866
Mullingar.	34.36421338257974
Dearest Papli.	21.723553208998755
Young student.	17.528190071851277
Yes, yes: a woman too.	21.7791857798558
Life, life.	18.52396791582807
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.	14.7321064974808
— Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.	11.660590124746571
— He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn ’ t that squint troubling him.	12.977892032325288
Do you follow me?	12.716993915701986
He closed his left eye.	17.29067453478567
Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.	11.609339947440573
— What is this, he said, in the name of God?	19.167332443397797
Crumbs?	44.69076581821027
— Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.	11.266301542111568
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats.	9.457996454016468
Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said: — Unless I ’ m greatly mistaken.	12.079144818995301
What do you think, Martin?	19.082828741595634
— It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.	10.814836017722195
Mr Bloom set his thigh down.	15.026040538384269
Glad I took that bath.	16.29352406886294
Feel my feet quite clean.	14.795361040048034
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.	9.229468437685894
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.	13.45723375308508
— After all, he said, it ’ s the most natural thing in the world.	16.95825071872948
— Did Tom Kernan turn up?	14.420996454055771
Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.	13.964307660438282
— Yes, Mr Bloom answered.	11.671591815273686
He ’ s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.	12.628700424272063
— And Corny Kelleher himself?	15.071963704466251
— At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.	10.115322390954262
— I met M ’ Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said.	12.16824052664481
He said he ’ d try to come.	18.760894566549844
The carriage halted short.	13.10617255313834
— What ’ s wrong?	16.744527007103713
— We ’ re stopped.	14.36503341047657
— Where are we?	18.407593851516264
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.	20.584661036445397
— The grand canal, he said.	9.906176057392976
Whooping cough they say it cures.	15.842290016365343
Good job Milly never got it.	12.75615065637441
Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions.	10.731229936465175
Shame really.	24.277196799428243
Only measles.	20.581242179641293
Flaxseed tea.	23.636405753492184
Scarlatina, influenza epidemics.	10.824635852730601
Canvassing for death.	17.849718787530648
Don ’ t miss this chance.	13.041946535108206
Dogs ’ home over there.	14.924021766624655
Thy will be done.	23.797621089719307
We obey them in the grave.	21.875686446016697
A dying scrawl.	16.035905859537262
He took it to heart, pined away.	17.48032760360549
Quiet brute.	24.4392315571736
Old men ’ s dogs usually are.	18.1715491095936
A raindrop spat on his hat.	13.810211389607566
He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags.	13.676202201179427
Apart.	44.876532221709276
Curious.	42.390196191673446
Like through a colander.	19.20173643421399
I thought it would.	19.57757650715211
My boots were creaking I remember now.	12.437191852864588
— The weather is changing, he said quietly.	12.629643843900505
— A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.	10.052727399205791
— Wanted for the country, Mr Power said.	17.740258348326762
There ’ s the sun again coming out.	16.28622638193801
Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.	12.401324330635719
— We ’ re off again.	12.892710170223332
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.	8.372776544658022
— Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.	11.94677623155835
And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.	18.919283803777535
— O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly.	15.985115152103761
Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard ’ s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.	16.921126781820995
— Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously.	10.830907708188045
_His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my <URL> — Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing.	18.157369604170576
And the retrospective arrangement.	12.820984853969174
— Did you read Dan Dawson ’ s speech?	15.563603197734835
Martin Cunningham asked.	13.406050718810354
— I did not then, Mr Dedalus said.	14.628715464959393
Where is it?	17.192258980119306
— In the paper this morning.	18.39631030367645
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket.	19.376208523744506
That book I must change for her.	16.33695714991272
Later on please.	18.42178389217921
Mr Bloom ’ s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that?	8.622554049932036
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne ’ s?	16.49403505127974
no, Sexton, Urbright.	11.152451654084455
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.	12.33639317953917
Thanks to the Little Flower.	28.370835605032838
Sadly missed.	24.675614612200924
To the inexpressible grief of his.	12.432900793391315
Aged <NUM> after a long and tedious illness.	16.146961001883543
Month ’ s mind: Quinlan.	19.851468205659117
On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.	10.793007532334936
It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high.	10.432886257511393
I tore up the envelope?	26.4321950994157
Yes.	14.82237916275066
Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath?	20.383380304093492
He patted his waistcoatpocket.	12.53434224500292
There all right.	17.853926814064117
Dear Henry fled.	16.772068542214974
Before my patience are exhausted.	11.765169282387221
National school.	25.434835391216573
Meade ’ s yard.	27.327151470869858
The hazard.	21.5579061762502
Only two there now.	14.14538668961322
Nodding.	44.876532221709276
Full as a tick.	26.315498090802254
Too much bone in their skulls.	17.2691225994281
The other trotting round with a fare.	19.174644394116896
An hour ago I was passing there.	18.86277465363088
The jarvies raised their hats.	13.426892355704853
A pointsman ’ s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom ’ s window.	10.4174685349334
Couldn ’ t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier?	11.39512066134326
Well but that fellow would lose his job then?	14.016280230926041
Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?	16.010113367816075
Antient concert rooms.	17.37159100767339
Nothing on there.	17.495979569870933
A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet.	17.603138222614767
Not much grief there.	13.718757809350267
Quarter mourning.	24.403028612469406
People in law perhaps.	13.304397054147438
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark ’ s, under the railway bridge, past the Queen ’ s theatre: in silence.	13.20665761655803
Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	9.266791359487545
Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I wonder.	21.761946405274823
I said I.	21.165057936204313
Or the _Lily of Killarney_?	9.754211446397443
Elster Grimes Opera Company.	12.17991705724624
Big powerful change.	16.824651866055678
Wet bright bills for next week.	11.509480219678707
_Fun on the Bristol_.	32.13305891808059
Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety.	17.354531275851702
Have to stand a drink or two.	15.2736165623204
As broad as it ’ s long.	21.987007092796418
He ’ s coming in the afternoon.	25.350518472623648
Her songs.	23.833306799814572
Plasto ’ s.	22.28853305971708
Sir Philip Crampton ’ s memorial fountain bust.	12.820563229032786
Who was he?	29.41064719083624
— How do you do?	13.671867659445855
Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.	14.268243919149807
— He doesn ’ t see us, Mr Power said.	13.751350174847365
Yes, he does.	23.011446302063213
How do you do?	15.45398942942087
— Who?	12.787285610070553
Mr Dedalus asked.	12.277348434955702
— Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said.	13.934996615342763
There he is airing his quiff.	11.562539120796977
Just that moment I was thinking.	20.78187086367698
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute.	12.644838568878663
From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.	12.238639312997892
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand.	19.29586474007337
The nails, yes.	15.853457267975825
Is there anything more in him that they she sees?	18.58335343009204
Fascination.	44.876532221709276
Worst man in Dublin.	23.23459423299801
That keeps him alive.	13.027609318060337
They sometimes feel what a person is.	15.192445502311278
Instinct.	38.158413547064754
But a type like that.	13.003519664858654
My nails.	24.624713098020184
I am just looking at them: well pared.	14.375989408092623
And after: thinking alone.	11.595564740063612
Body getting a bit softy.	19.60492103124361
I would notice that: from remembering.	16.010296124544922
I suppose the skin can ’ t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off.	13.489908492217024
But the shape is there.	15.848375419275934
The shape is there still.	16.471756151103623
Shoulders.	44.876532221709276
Hips.	44.876532221709276
Plump.	44.876532221709276
Night of the dance dressing.	31.368664926512125
Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.	16.0157388689605
He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.	12.952685404145534
Mr Power asked: — How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?	21.736585390350896
— O, very well, Mr Bloom said.	14.395879812906637
I hear great accounts of it.	12.492015402504833
It ’ s a good idea, you see...	14.643090411723712
— Are you going yourself?	12.495307692248302
— Well no, Mr Bloom said.	12.501412941122794
In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business.	18.291442958005774
You see the idea is to tour the chief towns.	15.26144462204688
What you lose on one you can make up on the other.	17.417570756400202
— Quite so, Martin Cunningham said.	10.456900437186132
Mary Anderson is up there now.	16.250791172745082
Have you good artists?	17.19832629684945
— Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said.	9.044391323490835
O yes, we ’ ll have all topnobbers.	18.000463743319106
J.	9.525932994442917
C.	14.373100099742409
Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and.	14.230697773131544
The best, in fact.	21.65611335925522
— And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling.	13.042839019415778
Last but not least.	20.31819122371526
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them.	12.232040666604167
Smith O ’ Brien.	24.497515936368917
Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.	10.786428129299736
Woman.	32.218436486104274
Must be his deathday.	15.898843848886166
For many happy returns.	13.20596969140433
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.	15.27449686061168
— Four bootlaces for a penny.	14.654092533691394
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls.	24.459327384397227
Had his office in Hume street.	10.387807648737512
Same house as Molly ’ s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.	11.147466426366224
Has that silk hat ever since.	14.97796975541652
Relics of old decency.	21.086270764915785
Mourning too.	22.87299924979919
Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.	10.058302678834085
O ’ Callaghan on his last legs.	18.912054341253558
Twenty past eleven.	17.37911989292906
Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.	16.08972724967133
Doing her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_.	8.808992005134263
No: _vorrei e non_.	9.274141894242545
Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split.	22.9845440950284
_Mi trema un poco il_.	8.23065741036244
Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone.	13.882378035435252
A thrush.	17.204788711247417
A throstle.	18.212387428160984
There is a word throstle that expresses that.	13.87605531715099
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power ’ s goodlooking face.	12.68657790056496
Greyish over the ears.	24.939273398536585
_Madame_: smiling.	17.798388469513256
I smiled back.	19.410753301723155
A smile goes a long way.	17.762456262224315
Only politeness perhaps.	15.672917300497295
Nice fellow.	24.649052960166863
Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps?	21.920546008754272
Not pleasant for the wife.	24.494983140965868
Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal.	25.435470608970725
You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick.	12.10546319305885
Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak.	14.110029470224687
What is this she was?	20.292463989429503
Barmaid in Jury ’ s.	11.996543752946062
They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator ’ s form.	16.4135772422998
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.	12.663459124171492
— Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.	10.763730616270532
A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery ’ s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.	12.722501438692996
— In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.	13.0447163461607
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly: — The devil break the hasp of your back! Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray ’ s statue.	14.465625458222043
— We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.	14.31936414165777
His eyes met Mr Bloom ’ s eyes.	16.70779567831289
He caressed his beard, adding: — Well, nearly all of us.	13.255855353584801
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions ’ faces.	12.231560898321595
— That ’ s an awfully good one that ’ s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.	14.21043891055135
— Yes.	10.060020338761374
Isn ’ t it awfully good?	14.41594218081438
— What is that?	12.610617174395742
Mr Dedalus asked.	12.277348434955702
I didn ’ t hear it.	13.456905460112466
— There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm ’ s way but when they were both.....	18.284949113443556
— What?	11.778589598318154
Mr Dedalus asked.	12.277348434955702
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?	9.774318739714452
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown.....	18.93878912244283
— Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried.	12.066694540961079
I wish to Christ he did! Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.	13.821767451077559
— No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....	14.035041642095202
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely: — Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.	15.096353471680938
— For God ’ s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright.	16.388702403338236
Is he dead?	19.5590012285975
— Dead! Martin Cunningham cried.	13.613674296127193
Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive.	17.81577100653464
Half the town was there.	17.50686805031269
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	8.254277600571053
But the funny part is.....	10.866292289977892
— And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son ’ s life.	11.64994637099027
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power ’ s hand.	14.663836281691344
— O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed.	16.305379395809336
Like a hero.	19.339615746923556
A silver florin.	16.559436859675117
— Isn ’ t it awfully good?	12.84182922019725
Mr Bloom said eagerly.	12.972879306909057
— One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.	11.923722645117248
Mr Power ’ s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.	17.159350574937065
Nelson ’ s pillar.	28.46924979066945
— Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny! — We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.	11.957612686062657
Mr Dedalus sighed.	17.343194688795865
— Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn ’ t grudge us a laugh.	15.467498475310009
Many a good one he told himself.	20.214598692767566
— The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers.	14.414929903873224
Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I ’ d be driving after him like this.	17.755032451104285
He ’ s gone from us.	14.22726862324914
— As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said.	13.662714745392046
He went very suddenly.	13.857461943720857
— Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said.	8.526296744301435
Heart.	38.72906440432802
He tapped his chest sadly.	13.792093869019121
Blazing face: redhot.	16.543343220769817
Too much John Barleycorn.	12.051083081536202
Cure for a red nose.	27.57650555751464
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite.	17.072884531440337
A lot of money he spent colouring it.	11.954123816264358
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.	12.420902058342902
— He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.	15.719464461436308
— The best death, Mr Bloom said.	13.077975772141123
Their wide open eyes looked at him.	13.739911964057686
— No suffering, he said.	10.849392780037713
A moment and all is over.	26.56240144665618
Like dying in sleep.	16.849991745292417
No - one spoke.	15.984743851891764
Dead side of the street this.	28.614774118264958
Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer ’ s railway guide, civil service college, Gill ’ s, catholic club, the industrious blind.	10.235883276413785
Why?	18.457368458488407
Some reason.	25.120191610576008
Sun or wind.	17.612333340720596
At night too.	18.041787033208916
Chummies and slaveys.	14.687990481940115
Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew.	15.353475347979101
Foundation stone for Parnell.	15.231431102383635
Breakdown.	49.9750299142878
Heart.	38.72906440432802
White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping.	10.56202363154065
A tiny coffin flashed by.	11.43730104368178
In a hurry to bury.	15.816459214324746
A mourning coach.	16.684076679451945
Unmarried.	44.876532221709276
Black for the married.	35.31042747682499
Piebald for bachelors.	17.961333973984228
Dun for a nun.	39.04732772867278
— Sad, Martin Cunningham said.	8.66707757512983
A child.	20.883235579129444
A dwarf ’ s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy ’ s was.	14.147946009781986
Dwarf ’ s body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box.	15.185652177605983
Burial friendly society pays.	13.647703549549293
Penny a week for a sod of turf.	15.878556025896142
Our.	32.104438638605835
Little.	41.84727669477548
Beggar.	43.11253835167618
Baby.	49.9750299142878
Meant nothing.	23.104035123063543
Mistake of nature.	18.41964089167935
If it ’ s healthy it ’ s from the mother.	25.365584599500544
If not from the man.	24.840370943757254
Better luck next time.	13.866178767989245
— Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said.	13.027425852625468
It ’ s well out of it.	14.954084208360891
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square.	8.94944312319255
Rattle his bones.	14.41400160035161
Over the stones.	15.81761298535198
Only a pauper.	16.43358188409756
Nobody owns.	17.534670613951814
— In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.	10.876088972440575
— But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.	20.172182380096128
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.	10.122526982779574
— The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.	18.560440491154054
— Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.	11.791317563045993
We must take a charitable view of it.	14.063066331576206
— They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.	16.715567011894148
— It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.	12.085607451184359
Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again.	18.133809871213632
Looking away now.	17.807411478172938
Sympathetic human man he is.	16.369254578020815
Intelligent.	44.876532221709276
Like Shakespeare ’ s face.	18.862798059564422
Always a good word to say.	20.270473786655124
They have no mercy on that here or infanticide.	16.234351967022373
Refuse christian burial.	16.44751662549685
They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave.	16.07142058976305
Yet sometimes they repent too late.	11.546266047947364
Found in the riverbed clutching rushes.	19.70199214073712
He looked at me.	14.997271934666836
And that awful drunkard of a wife of his.	18.65984459977019
Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost.	13.671538732535147
Leading him the life of the damned.	33.00702529919628
Monday morning.	26.4719910980631
Start afresh.	21.460269733513158
Shoulder to the wheel.	32.79687881982143
Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there.	20.07759831184351
Drunk about the place and capering with Martin ’ s umbrella.	19.195545609801684
And they call me the jewel of Asia, Of Asia, The geisha.	10.207087431432742
He looked away from me.	18.404733179113432
He knows.	20.34940124536195
Rattle his bones.	14.41400160035161
That afternoon of the inquest.	29.36303999662426
The redlabelled bottle on the table.	14.403527087991929
The room in the hotel with hunting pictures.	16.530148642115797
Stuffy it was.	24.577754032092997
Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind.	22.048947354225657
The coroner ’ s sunlit ears, big and hairy.	15.049821055454368
Boots giving evidence.	17.022621153136843
Thought he was asleep first.	24.836857732548324
Then saw like yellow streaks on his face.	11.624494491508175
Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.	20.651508764892405
Verdict: overdose.	15.822911115239078
Death by misadventure.	15.372838054179175
The letter.	22.869019780160176
For my son Leopold.	18.978715805003105
No more pain.	17.179661265095664
Wake no more.	20.279546257405524
Nobody owns.	17.534670613951814
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street.	7.768216131719349
Over the stones.	15.81761298535198
— We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.	11.284882154163684
— I hope not, Martin Cunningham said.	10.375135901692078
That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany.	13.92060769848294
The Gordon Bennett.	15.385705474256714
— Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said.	11.495844611778612
That will be worth seeing, faith.	13.161846228397412
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls.	12.706472320787778
Has anybody here seen Kelly?	11.629538267080596
Kay ee double ell wy.	8.679772252845483
Dead March from <URL> He ’ s as bad as old Antonio.	14.091981591116367
He left me on my ownio.	22.285467097029883
Pirouette! The _Mater Misericordiae_.	15.462955608609956
Eccles street.	24.465662162204183
My house down there.	15.835972970614689
Big place.	24.066015024773613
Ward for incurables there.	12.728849616018563
Deadhouse handy underneath.	15.672451037595042
Where old Mrs Riordan died.	15.699195091293248
They look terrible the women.	13.596413463117848
Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon.	16.17572127809075
Then the screen round her bed for her to die.	17.802476875733763
Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me.	13.232382809779608
He ’ s gone over to the lying - in hospital they told me.	13.57522744333756
From one extreme to the other.	18.66240754489676
The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.	11.427145594180638
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups.	6.848262873372926
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.	9.781005927705777
— Emigrants, Mr Power said.	11.291887060246985
— Huuuh! the drover ’ s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.	15.01460156115308
Huuuh! out of that! Thursday, of course.	19.96686822395146
Tomorrow is killing day.	12.8509639039557
Springers.	44.876532221709276
Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each.	9.708983216000307
For Liverpool probably.	15.929783089237555
Roastbeef for old England.	18.513640684602446
They buy up all the juicy ones.	16.28746131784809
And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns.	11.262247394855335
Comes to a big thing in a year.	38.61617960725305
Dead meat trade.	16.81021569258958
Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine.	12.525500656694167
Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.	9.008054941643843
The carriage moved on through the drove.	14.433387976976878
— I can ’ t make out why the corporation doesn ’ t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.	13.122103546979337
All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.	15.159375907437314
— Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.	8.8514986240565
Quite right.	17.76721585187311
They ought to.	16.67943811478807
Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all.	13.39002263608445
Don ’ t you see what I mean?	18.645337682531157
— O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.	16.275979868722683
Pullman car and saloon diningroom.	13.765118913899677
— A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.	11.76416037420877
Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus.	16.848255932284005
Wouldn ’ t it be more decent than galloping two abreast?	11.315614604893433
— Well, there ’ s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.	20.933029732390384
— And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn ’ t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy ’ s and upset the coffin on to the road.	12.915600739741345
— That was terrible, Mr Power ’ s shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road.	17.357440829019495
Gordon Bennett cup.	18.22246952962687
— Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.	12.391403219839994
Bom! Upset.	14.715258369638006
A coffin bumped out on to the road.	18.630547719325744
Burst open.	23.530223321297534
Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him.	15.508290023160912
Red face: grey now.	14.79628029002489
Mouth fallen open.	17.423656233454178
Asking what ’ s up now.	21.403575138101033
Quite right to close it.	19.523148892252017
Looks horrid open.	16.543080155209328
Then the insides decompose quickly.	10.18545889959979
Much better to close up all the orifices.	19.139321549361448
Yes, also.	22.202088835103257
With wax.	24.805072911402107
The sphincter loose.	14.864142450974756
Seal up all.	22.828105728195524
— Dunphy ’ s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.	16.592213531727516
Dunphy ’ s corner.	28.18131997079731
Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.	12.441337933554934
A pause by the wayside.	21.346872366108528
Tiptop position for a pub.	23.088862263463994
Expect we ’ ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health.	20.4324043231125
Pass round the consolation.	25.243900924313543
But suppose now it did happen.	14.288839279202818
Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about?	13.001455148754513
He would and he wouldn ’ t, I suppose.	20.97999066817838
Depends on where.	17.67749608332735
The circulation stops.	16.47958686184717
Still some might ooze out of an artery.	15.089185817807495
It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.	19.84820602326146
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road.	9.706414061972872
An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.	12.669629404437647
Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.	19.77683607706042
Water rushed roaring through the sluices.	15.349906801704416
A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf.	10.733363608441726
On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse.	11.534957136032208
Aboard of the <URL> Their eyes watched him.	22.96299406025609
On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.	7.354835299159232
Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal.	16.298353848052106
Or cycle down.	16.060948834171718
Hire some old crock, safety.	11.26838030974124
Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady ’ s.	18.149160908887506
Developing waterways.	21.577729785062214
James M ’ Cann ’ s hobby to row me o ’ er the ferry.	12.244668511814229
Cheaper transit.	22.959358561719682
By easy stages.	14.86088392247116
Houseboats.	44.876532221709276
Camping out.	24.416370139316975
Also hearses.	19.98718393531694
To heaven by water.	16.889340305407146
Perhaps I will without writing.	18.705983370862793
Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla.	12.630807265164641
Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin.	9.737737699167274
With turf from the midland bogs.	17.024947476194342
Salute.	51.98932121274747
He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.	11.013451724508355
They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house.	8.948705315271868
Near it now.	17.854660069426693
— I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.	12.62360705866959
— Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.	10.315708930069658
— How is that?	13.994334410763608
Martin Cunningham said.	8.623899982574008
Left him weeping, I suppose?	18.183966008394147
— Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.	13.848627152394673
The carriage steered left for Finglas road.	8.115436813953007
The stonecutter ’ s yard on the right.	21.494053662739795
Last lap.	20.913325147960915
Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing.	10.87595658233643
Fragments of shapes, hewn.	11.051172529894105
In white silence: appealing.	13.304373521694703
The best obtainable.	16.129047628039736
Thos.	44.876532221709276
H.	23.035625582092514
Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.	8.057013897009321
Passed.	44.876532221709276
On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton ’ s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot.	10.618012242293126
After life ’ s journey.	27.86117318365228
Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.	11.45262403474447
Mr Power pointed.	18.72410702230158
— That is where Childs was murdered, he said.	9.213828165110543
The last house.	16.883784606092036
— So it is, Mr Dedalus said.	13.958155596999505
A gruesome case.	16.16259029530307
Seymour Bushe got him off.	20.659232931747468
Murdered his brother.	19.881430650921576
Or so they said.	17.099962941165455
— The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.	11.67246070275257
— Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added.	10.726697314934189
That ’ s the maxim of the law.	17.18689273801772
Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.	10.186639426865769
They looked.	23.73158861495138
Murderer ’ s ground.	28.934937938070217
It passed darkly.	16.602540142362404
Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden.	7.713948379802107
Whole place gone to hell.	17.837796263141666
Wrongfully condemned.	20.531908815027172
Murder.	48.9929530895421
The murderer ’ s image in the eye of the murdered.	33.10374578806016
They love reading about it.	13.214365510184518
Man ’ s head found in a garden.	29.34289112638072
Her clothing consisted of.	13.090561912390365
Recent outrage.	23.29473476946619
Murderer is still at large.	17.27598758068162
Clues.	44.876532221709276
A shoelace.	20.463129549418564
The body to be exhumed.	24.49414690183089
Murder will out.	18.68707614331296
Cramped in this carriage.	22.58153992095198
She mightn ’ t like me to come that way without letting her know.	18.541168735933727
Must be careful about women.	13.306320828722756
Catch them once with their pants down.	15.547864492899086
Never forgive you after.	17.899650610690998
Fifteen.	34.66058585774379
The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze.	7.59212401925623
Dark poplars, rare white forms.	9.871134532844172
Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.	8.617629664364623
The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped.	11.338548648642199
Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee.	15.029277421007611
He stepped out.	16.6025983268108
Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.	21.075070900464898
Change that soap now.	14.61202464198385
Mr Bloom ’ s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.	8.899652712304528
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.	13.618518644625214
Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages.	10.648881553110824
It ’ s all the same.	14.73421028518315
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley.	8.194432368985481
Pomp of death.	18.273006528282178
Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit.	8.453997105611723
Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.	13.148371650527316
Dogbiscuits.	44.876532221709276
Who ate them?	18.495683633837398
Mourners coming out.	20.74229635379805
He followed his companions.	15.595652305686281
Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them.	12.083578288060068
Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths.	17.66146272782574
He handed one to the boy.	21.81935216545115
Where is that child ’ s funeral disappeared to?	18.788563235683387
A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block.	7.105712079239099
The waggoner marching at their head saluted.	11.904002080230411
Coffin now.	22.870672780332484
Got here before us, dead as he is.	19.416967287578533
Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways.	18.821560201296183
Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something.	13.052644215682502
Do they know what they cart out here every day?	17.22410304451367
Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day.	7.815066188975379
Then Mount Jerome for the protestants.	21.319066678414618
Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute.	17.11655351185913
Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.	15.532645699926578
Too many in the world.	19.30654933460343
Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl.	19.125291991764602
Leanjawed harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry.	13.077762416969874
Girl ’ s face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman ’ s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.	18.919862693453844
The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates.	13.826588453724922
So much dead weight.	13.934969873596216
Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath.	15.728345112069851
First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff.	22.58286367065391
Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths.	20.830523789068703
Who is that beside them?	21.77602403390563
Ah, the brother - in - law.	15.262989880195752
All walked after.	17.820105960224392
Martin Cunningham whispered: — I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.	13.346276997756423
— What?	11.778589598318154
Mr Power whispered.	15.354918199422295
How so?	22.969553031481034
— His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered.	12.643970992216396
Had the Queen ’ s hotel in Ennis.	15.729899103845552
You heard him say he was going to Clare.	18.962189284852755
Anniversary.	44.876532221709276
— O God! Mr Power whispered.	17.603836889976325
First I heard of it.	20.504779405508003
Poisoned himself?	25.02842764210824
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal ’ s mausoleum.	15.987444525885918
Speaking.	43.669601723859934
— Was he insured?	14.499322745672435
Mr Bloom asked.	11.735074165646148
— I believe so, Mr Kernan answered.	18.891854877482093
But the policy was heavily mortgaged.	9.941325148433384
Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.	12.758793065203337
— How many children did he leave?	15.630846563274332
— Five.	24.725405533036476
— A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently.	13.883665531367459
Five young children.	17.48848850427653
— A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.	21.081628466802954
— Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.	17.650422990221376
Has the laugh at him now.	19.27540273521927
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished.	17.148311959151656
She had outlived him.	12.717390249976235
Lost her husband.	21.782032031509235
More dead for her than for me.	19.430541417583086
One must outlive the other.	12.62100418324657
Wise men say.	17.465273775176332
There are more women than men in the world.	13.413599967649054
Condole with her.	23.705378839657026
Your terrible loss.	16.399357873883755
I hope you ’ ll soon follow him.	14.893241019035562
For Hindu widows only.	11.535219600335456
She would marry another.	14.240094511617164
Him?	53.55459618909777
No. Yet who knows after.	13.507890077692844
Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died.	23.455731900485013
Drawn on a guncarriage.	25.443761140648586
Victoria and Albert.	19.06670394867036
Frogmore memorial mourning.	14.747771946735018
But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet.	23.240338115678718
Vain in her heart of hearts.	22.876246755496048
All for a shadow.	28.06061980533242
Consort not even a king.	20.484986398300865
Her son was the substance.	26.026774026344324
Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting.	18.021121902370282
It never comes.	16.908154116619016
— How are you, Simon?	23.256015500178133
Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands.	12.363462167380886
Haven ’ t seen you for a month of Sundays.	20.163793297199792
— Never better.	15.989300281811182
How are all in Cork ’ s own town?	21.353831040539372
— I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said.	10.905807047759783
Same old six and eightpence.	14.92353258868638
Stopped with Dick Tivy.	12.859099770563803
— And how is Dick, the solid man?	17.320848962284035
— Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.	12.227333111326663
— By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder.	13.526340450351627
Dick Tivy bald?	17.653900178741022
— Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead.	15.659544767565428
A few bob a skull.	12.628177104202845
Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.	11.579506044665308
— Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously.	12.570274421331275
Is that the eldest boy in front?	20.30003468340943
— Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife ’ s brother.	18.640400971842
John Henry Menton is behind.	11.85261052502342
He put down his name for a quid.	26.81487267684625
— I ’ ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said.	10.590036618165184
I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job.	11.891801645688057
John Henry is not the worst in the world.	19.988940336145195
— How did he lose it?	16.367442439250507
Ned Lambert asked.	13.19959248234421
Liquor, what?	22.940333697486842
— Many a good man ’ s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.	19.868209002412033
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel.	21.339602995227796
Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar.	13.579502956518917
Poor boy! Was he there when the father?	21.306327895214185
Both unconscious.	21.09735785994804
Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time.	18.888254473953623
All he might have done.	20.548639651749806
I owe three shillings to O ’ Grady.	17.28531535521597
Would he understand?	17.81868481352978
The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel.	15.33899078863952
Which end is his head?	26.54259996573136
After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.	20.2516890645624
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners.	9.984404453561385
Always in front of us.	18.121105439997194
Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel.	12.058886376704308
The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks.	12.458184920232382
Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it.	10.498637256086115
He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.	11.82339356859232
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door.	15.909182886795099
Who ’ ll read the book?	25.812738208508197
I, said the rook.	15.696326438124732
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.	23.256507023980358
Father Coffey.	25.56123346173782
I knew his name was like a coffin.	23.852018081934357
<URL> Bully about the muzzle he looks.	14.693776347050939
Bosses the show.	17.112209107585134
Muscular christian.	24.286161930786534
Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest.	11.583873657463029
Thou art Peter.	18.898840598468155
Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will.	16.26176268091373
With a belly on him like a poisoned pup.	17.423459470393098
Most amusing expressions that man finds.	12.877092460169425
Hhhn: burst sideways.	13.53859497792528
_ — Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, <URL> Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin.	7.8077539520972055
Requiem mass.	23.34829395764172
Crape weepers.	21.577729785062214
Blackedged notepaper.	22.959358561719682
Your name on the altarlist.	26.391670409648466
Chilly place this.	17.510602854939968
Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please.	21.249163238783485
Eyes of a toad too.	23.41467370442849
What swells him up that way?	21.91855008319745
Molly gets swelled after cabbage.	12.049842152364084
Air of the place maybe.	35.35700226357052
Looks full up of bad gas.	15.31558504645239
Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place.	13.98929202002456
Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks.	15.975816466602849
Who was telling me?	16.24115976935368
Mervyn Browne.	23.507245565066654
Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh ’ s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it.	14.483009363755905
Out it rushes: blue.	11.778792478649013
One whiff of that and you ’ re a goner.	18.01825176065706
My kneecap is hurting me.	9.071479058568386
Ow. That ’ s better.	20.954274154906035
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy ’ s bucket and shook it over the coffin.	20.50175555646162
Then he walked to the other end and shook it again.	18.903948423442863
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket.	21.703910652521504
As you were before you rested.	20.215113745941697
It ’ s all written down: he has to do it.	15.972896869535845
_ — Et ne nos inducas in <URL> The server piped the answers in the treble.	9.243747003930237
I often thought it would be better to have boy servants.	17.646344237725636
Up to fifteen or so.	15.826522548162293
After that, of course...	19.49259022857848
Holy water that was, I expect.	25.816436633753302
Shaking sleep out of it.	17.18303156471684
He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.	14.904359782141922
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over.	20.701716915633924
Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows ’ breasts.	7.3151186020552155
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep.	17.105789234220556
On Dignam now.	16.87283368546776
_ — In <URL> Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise.	16.75907112925979
Says that over everybody.	13.645018712283038
Tiresome kind of a job.	25.066646266497777
But he has to say something.	25.83943775882224
The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.	18.38248254459096
Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart.	16.496101482897505
Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother - in - law.	15.058455100312012
All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air.	18.008201720423855
Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket.	10.284213996385018
He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left.	17.136186093986517
The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.	9.862799742371685
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo.	7.231263138444168
Lord, I mustn ’ t lilt here.	21.52377393265466
— The O ’ Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.	15.051575924719524
Mr Power ’ s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.	19.660221848856022
— He ’ s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O ’.	17.80033513385465
But his heart is buried in Rome.	13.460602663753368
How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon! — Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said.	12.70650755365831
I ’ ll soon be stretched beside her.	11.091830204820596
Let Him take me whenever He likes.	12.793301734955376
Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk.	18.83766409743212
Mr Power took his arm.	18.406273001149604
— She ’ s better where she is, he said kindly.	18.270724032762192
— I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp.	16.50591121062336
I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven.	22.00038661273348
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.	9.203336666030168
— Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.	13.294760906573782
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.	12.405733035308018
— The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said.	14.651060210582116
I suppose we can do so too.	17.12453744802869
We are the last.	20.01074551376265
This cemetery is a treacherous place.	15.434041882078198
They covered their heads.	15.423753102914588
— The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don ’ t you think?	12.837515095299752
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes.	15.050811490195748
Mason, I think: not sure.	21.334540326162397
Beside him again.	16.68232918022969
We are the last.	20.01074551376265
In the same boat.	21.841273214110533
Hope he ’ ll say something else.	18.22320118405739
Mr Kernan added: — The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say.	11.370496375183759
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent.	12.441042721182882
The language of course was another thing.	19.901824204905154
Mr Kernan said with solemnity: — _I am the resurrection and the life_.	17.30226403807161
That touches a man ’ s inmost heart.	16.79517253079532
— It does, Mr Bloom said.	12.122005953259558
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies?	16.934202929559557
No touching that.	17.828431707312
Seat of the affections.	39.71175118698841
Broken heart.	23.41507258701327
A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day.	10.945445104047778
One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are.	14.411074405393535
Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers.	9.55062079596523
Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else.	10.289925465272825
The resurrection and the life.	23.92970137906288
Once you are dead you are dead.	19.631971250687393
That last day idea.	17.35281859021131
Knocking them all up out of their graves.	22.040638981276622
Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job.	15.03769144022214
Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps.	14.95948335030684
Find damn all of himself that morning.	17.080201494790458
Pennyweight of powder in a skull.	18.40030290665185
Twelve grammes one pennyweight.	10.836854924117754
Troy measure.	27.713441497770827
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.	12.020730147576918
— Everything went off A<NUM>, he said.	9.269637444009717
What?	14.617951109062046
He looked on them from his drawling eye.	17.242204532924337
Policeman ’ s shoulders.	28.572420014686596
With your tooraloom tooraloom.	14.018913547730328
— As it should be, Mr Kernan said.	17.51165696005386
— What?	11.778589598318154
Corny Kelleher said.	12.318428971110514
Mr Kernan assured him.	13.705200151385611
John Henry Menton asked.	13.14731216824382
I know his face.	15.271844508083609
Ned Lambert glanced back.	14.958529658797994
— Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.	22.24699900245017
She ’ s his wife.	17.216336989267205
— O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said.	14.225680231689362
I haven ’ t seen her for some time.	17.06553609653951
She was a finelooking woman.	17.19736847197776
I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon ’ s in Roundtown.	13.215367559816936
And a good armful she was.	17.969934595159447
He looked behind through the others.	18.53911312183153
— What is he?	13.9771287100814
he asked.	10.295735601437203
What does he do?	18.029058126786413
Wasn ’ t he in the stationery line?	25.057018789766662
I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.	21.899519001734813
Ned Lambert smiled.	17.788715161536945
A traveller for blottingpaper.	14.203569265697434
— In God ’ s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for?	17.57545817925424
She had plenty of game in her then.	14.40856910666082
— Has still, Ned Lambert said.	11.434017441596579
He does some canvassing for ads.	10.98531449155745
John Henry Menton ’ s large eyes stared ahead.	12.567184595226033
The barrow turned into a side lane.	16.72916100471952
A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage.	12.645026828927936
The gravediggers touched their caps.	12.248909943026009
— John O ’ Connell, Mr Power said pleased.	14.596117639180065
He never forgets a friend.	12.229906542292003
Mr O ’ Connell shook all their hands in silence.	14.39035021808098
Mr Dedalus said: — I am come to pay you another visit.	16.574891537255525
— My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice.	19.314997661427004
I don ’ t want your custom at all.	10.640749374089806
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham ’ s side puzzling two long keys at his back.	13.58527549139731
— Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?	23.840652858978306
— I did not, Martin Cunningham said.	11.210265088986775
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear.	8.469653069100149
The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.	14.364257471111724
— They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs.	16.64731948585147
They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried.	16.696320143035422
After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough.	15.979830845122942
One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy.	16.90306109364854
The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.	11.126639814707053
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed.	18.152483700959294
He resumed: — And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like the man_, says he.	14.745489233002564
_That ’ s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.	13.555247808654244
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.	11.888594965140756
— That ’ s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.	13.89029053270791
— I know, Hynes said.	12.237856811358274
I know that.	18.15070924074923
— To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said.	11.815335858873617
It ’ s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.	9.987494689576096
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker ’ s prosperous bulk.	14.915710240208483
All want to be on good terms with him.	16.713485843953077
Decent fellow, John O ’ Connell, real good sort.	14.802988768704962
Keys: like Keyes ’ s ad: no fear of anyone getting out.	13.590742095272093
No passout checks.	13.442902124369056
_Habeas corpus_.	19.698768402221454
I must see about that ad after the funeral.	19.25914846683971
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha?	12.267371158550425
Hope it ’ s not chucked in the dead letter office.	18.838396672504015
Be the better of a shave.	28.07481776584043
Grey sprouting beard.	14.459901412251153
That ’ s the first sign when the hairs come out grey.	15.204771729353517
And temper getting cross.	13.106748556284462
Silver threads among the grey.	19.811912308746585
Fancy being his wife.	19.829727139300427
Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl.	13.07958175374915
Come out and live in the graveyard.	32.26103823786911
Dangle that before her.	18.90759001669113
It might thrill her first.	11.812460267755645
Courting death.	22.869747941493785
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about.	15.396985607501405
The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O ’ Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark.	14.566593082500278
Will o ’ the wisp.	16.063715980229148
Gas of graves.	14.631887468380754
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all.	15.132380751096388
Women especially are so touchy.	13.130930961105905
Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep.	16.744818167979783
Have you ever seen a ghost?	20.599549710271262
Well, I have.	21.374710891722888
It was a pitchdark night.	13.90816595060275
The clock was on the stroke of twelve.	15.575011472921151
Still they ’ d kiss all right if properly keyed up.	13.209377201497993
Learn anything if taken young.	12.9928856788318
You might pick up a young widow here.	16.222962989793146
Men like that.	21.260874974590195
Love among the tombstones.	19.381709056259496
Romeo.	49.9750299142878
Spice of pleasure.	17.971213736878003
In the midst of death we are in life.	14.70967375951411
Both ends meet.	16.773632960791748
Tantalising for the poor dead.	34.050602831079466
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving.	16.9354920566413
Gnawing their vitals.	16.338498679794668
Desire to grig people.	11.518590989200616
Molly wanting to do it at the window.	24.10167171917554
Eight children he has anyway.	22.40539614279013
He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field.	12.797532928421555
Holy fields.	26.919871418040664
More room if they buried them standing.	13.709856689653309
Sitting or kneeling you couldn ’ t.	9.893466291566474
Standing?	44.69076581821027
His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing.	16.39263617147985
And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings.	8.77699484056148
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome.	8.414233452456573
Well, so it is.	20.778358204075598
Ought to be flowers of sleep.	18.562537325203213
Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me.	7.510110378478843
The Botanic Gardens are just over there.	9.330843786510957
It ’ s the blood sinking in the earth gives new life.	14.007211562937764
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.	9.958152297099264
Every man his price.	14.560848851686773
Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden.	6.934462509115621
A bargain.	24.133695010115186
By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six.	6.995945452762476
With thanks.	23.82387839503143
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails.	8.992209025735534
Charnelhouses.	44.876532221709276
Dreadful.	43.669601723859934
Turning green and pink decomposing.	12.855067350129852
Rot quick in damp earth.	12.164879256335611
The lean old ones tougher.	12.14830778411628
Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy.	17.85573550461176
Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them.	15.538580356679775
Then dried up.	16.324922557302354
Deathmoths.	44.876532221709276
Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living.	12.51392719294251
Changing about.	26.042766371361907
Live for ever practically.	20.363572088483732
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.	12.537009909727114
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots.	13.636799949334955
Soil must be simply swirling with them.	15.773523786484688
Your head it simply swurls.	10.590228502906324
Those pretty little seaside gurls.	11.411572242418421
He looks cheerful enough over it.	10.679066501088396
Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first.	19.31661802655969
Wonder how he looks at life.	16.323006863525674
Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart.	11.490536400465757
The one about the bulletin.	17.969364081453698
Spurgeon went to heaven <NUM> <URL>. this morning.	17.55761365152591
<NUM> <URL>. (closing time).	14.897635665884142
Not arrived yet.	14.080268932055569
Peter.	45.721761596159354
The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what ’ s in fashion.	16.12123857635853
A juicy pear or ladies ’ punch, hot, strong and sweet.	8.838860700676905
Keep out the damp.	24.627134053418327
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.	12.663370621163976
Gravediggers in _Hamlet_.	19.041103444480225
Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart.	17.530582202280502
Daren ’ t joke about the dead for two years at least.	23.689652888620923
_De mortuis nil nisi prius_.	7.2198598524766195
Go out of mourning first.	27.991843857358155
Hard to imagine his funeral.	14.305142627459814
Seems a sort of a joke.	22.600937206233702
Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer.	12.89861507379468
Gives you second wind.	14.022984453032008
New lease of life.	13.61088239765554
— How many have you for tomorrow?	19.106122180880966
the caretaker asked.	11.465542688501248
— Two, Corny Kelleher said.	11.027389242147308
Half ten and eleven.	17.9087866316115
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket.	17.948000030974473
The barrow had ceased to trundle.	10.47224589867768
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves.	14.242722758942195
The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.	9.301485944653724
Burying him.	25.215174658785855
We come to bury Cæsar.	19.29323917311585
His ides of March or June.	9.694518628151489
He doesn ’ t know who is here nor care.	13.519335837749601
Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh?	17.84729534377875
Now who is he I ’ d like to know?	23.01909187466537
Now I ’ d give a trifle to know who he is.	16.414910761713355
Always someone turns up you never dreamt of.	12.48113053916723
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life.	14.559620654289251
Yes, he could.	22.594986106304923
Still he ’ d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave.	16.685654031612955
We all do.	20.68707344202497
Only man buries.	16.837695540362255
No, ants too.	11.999886114916766
First thing strikes anybody.	13.754618332966604
Bury the dead.	18.81835025005499
Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life.	10.287093506362263
Well then Friday buried him.	12.464316780460443
Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.	14.121576561765027
O, poor Robinson Crusoe! How could you possibly do so?	14.16545231285382
Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box.	19.330625087434374
When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood.	13.975820113137207
All gnawed through.	15.984633498051528
They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way.	12.257889253154064
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow ’ s.	20.943960588880266
They ’ re so particular.	14.390941653619482
Lay me in my native earth.	20.76284170984175
Bit of clay from the holy land.	22.937840420178183
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin.	14.272438168258997
I see what it means.	19.896991634082344
I see.	15.5305652366756
To protect him as long as possible even in the earth.	17.366097344256936
The Irishman ’ s house is his coffin.	18.741074315496345
Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea.	10.592161697961338
Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.	16.89443629243064
Twelve.	48.08378767059378
I ’ m thirteen.	13.060235506460042
No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.	14.784987618018203
Death ’ s number.	36.550644322825896
Where the deuce did he pop out of?	16.889913813609976
He wasn ’ t in the chapel, that I ’ ll swear.	23.84768080850489
Silly superstition that about thirteen.	12.552965265112137
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit.	16.378022781175456
Tinge of purple.	18.773016547177157
I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west.	15.377133376998048
Dressy fellow he was once.	25.203721601741773
Used to change three suits in the day.	17.059112728037817
Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias.	11.91759726108243
Hello.	26.268180599479532
It ’ s dyed.	18.44203484961907
His wife I forgot he ’ s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.	12.273987103621076
The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles.	15.3512510312048
They struggled up and out: and all uncovered.	28.59304942411251
Twenty.	44.42357965536155
Pause.	44.876532221709276
If we were all suddenly somebody else.	15.652542892517543
Far away a donkey brayed.	12.373994688291496
Rain.	35.36909335234094
No such ass.	17.200137559739098
Never see a dead one, they say.	20.600470889531643
Shame of death.	18.713247434343618
They hide.	24.923541970108385
Also poor papa went away.	13.443790598545974
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper.	15.829889506810863
Whisper.	30.458547681459176
The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space.	14.225887773165885
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.	12.183920137898197
Wellcut frockcoat.	22.44976562170923
Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.	18.153457599045364
Well, it is a long rest.	23.974208711686533
Feel no more.	20.63804026306379
It ’ s the moment you feel.	15.726826705078885
Must be damned unpleasant.	15.068861182500173
Can ’ t believe it at first.	20.041301646191688
Mistake must be: someone else.	16.055334055720873
Try the house opposite.	23.536816706549907
Wait, I wanted to.	24.644933206047394
I haven ’ t yet.	19.83826902213837
Then darkened deathchamber.	14.175978151231067
Light they want.	23.4347390888344
Whispering around you.	17.341440531099146
Would you like to see a priest?	24.181619396901432
Then rambling and wandering.	12.974419100206644
Delirium all you hid all your life.	12.93988625578666
His sleep is not natural.	20.252963427280342
Press his lower eyelid.	14.416314618030684
Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow.	16.71414593650239
Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he ’ s doomed.	16.265317389155665
Devil in that picture of sinner ’ s death showing him a woman.	20.601616714627045
Dying to embrace her in his shirt.	21.470501433049613
Shall I nevermore behold thee_?	9.987192690850637
Bam! He expires.	21.670807066540196
Gone at last.	23.314216916310762
People talk about you a bit: forget you.	19.602370599123113
Don ’ t forget to pray for him.	13.961709743793525
Remember him in your prayers.	29.858774967175464
Even Parnell.	24.15836322914801
Ivy day dying out.	13.841674062855054
Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.	16.92694740246524
We are praying now for the repose of his soul.	16.762726368008334
Hoping you ’ re well and not in hell.	21.663753248783404
Nice change of air.	21.33909501783287
Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.	21.335322139653034
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself?	24.986523970271634
They say you do when you shiver in the sun.	19.397851138785423
Someone walking over it.	14.971865714129965
Near you.	24.143788796492043
Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought.	16.766748237062817
Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.	23.639645800916743
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin.	12.295752473530495
Mr Bloom turned away his face.	13.905349994005638
And if he was alive all the time?	24.59199067582889
Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course.	18.793743743571703
Of course he is dead.	20.492457722633365
Monday he died.	23.013196346900376
They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole.	14.36418236816935
Flag of distress.	14.679575486394208
Three days.	24.228183439940832
Rather long to keep them in summer.	18.096827073269264
Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there ’ s no.	20.176270836870177
The clay fell softer.	13.409666107062153
Begin to be forgotten.	31.074674531998507
Out of sight, out of mind.	22.069443548965115
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat.	14.492845612225844
Had enough of it.	18.945405771797915
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show.	11.616158154659917
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves.	13.249045613008434
Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.	18.896702884661757
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook.	18.535624491432735
Ah, the names.	30.72560883907251
But he knows them all.	17.49441171852381
No: coming to me.	16.18771675297265
— I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath.	10.941219267176288
What is your christian name?	14.408979192334243
I ’ m not sure.	11.616548121014251
Leopold.	40.03818556982737
He asked me to.	17.2081577748905
— Charley, Hynes said writing.	14.083021939781013
I know.	14.383905838937961
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.	19.67751565719334
Good idea a postmortem for doctors.	9.159570918290315
Find out what they imagine they know.	16.171850966842854
He died of a Tuesday.	29.005159658713893
Got the run.	21.353713011296072
Levanted with the cash of a few ads.	28.162774448717222
Charley, you ’ re my darling.	19.192241829526896
That was why he asked me to.	19.25914062774488
O well, does no harm.	16.904839176594727
I saw to that, M ’ Coy.	17.351712656043293
Thanks, old chap: much obliged.	13.160611019705403
Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.	9.341948340189036
— And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the...	16.565759191514115
He looked around.	17.21455374928818
— Macintosh.	20.322826291223308
Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said.	14.592110773811461
Where is he now?	19.469681130102263
— M ’ Intosh, Hynes said scribbling.	12.002490450640554
I don ’ t know who he is.	11.709884631552347
Is that his name?	24.726328821478543
He moved away, looking about him.	19.22982050638574
— No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping.	12.387187422313174
I say, Hynes! Didn ’ t hear.	14.993647612211666
What?	14.617951109062046
Where has he disappeared to?	13.120689588062575
Not a sign.	19.715838233071096
Well of all the.	21.32189335892869
Has anybody here seen?	13.95419253670523
Kay ee double ell.	11.348965596784456
Become invisible.	23.085380554907438
Good Lord, what became of him?	24.482827852114244
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.	9.683566589706864
— O, excuse me! He stepped aside nimbly.	15.226259295742844
Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole.	18.583725019695258
It rose.	23.780150463478346
Nearly over.	24.283193764163688
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades.	11.826039473496857
All uncovered again for a few instants.	18.7090321838408
The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother - in - law his on a lump.	12.659932095603693
The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow.	12.017633866187841
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean.	12.54676866372369
One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass.	13.374486834990837
One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.	9.126690740714963
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.	13.012738005116741
His navelcord.	23.449199244824868
The brother - in - law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.	15.833826064984343
Thanks in silence.	17.378253154981827
Sorry, sir: trouble.	19.89060281515098
Headshake.	44.876532221709276
I know that.	18.15070924074923
For yourselves just.	16.140443280593228
The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.	10.01986859073173
— Let us go round by the chief ’ s grave, Hynes said.	18.215962590323407
— Let us, Mr Power said.	13.671455244739368
They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts.	16.789137065229365
With awe Mr Power ’ s blank voice spoke: — Some say he is not in that grave at all.	19.78055862472149
That the coffin was filled with stones.	12.18990152665473
That one day he will come again.	18.437381067228667
Hynes shook his head.	16.60671496336536
— Parnell will never come again, he said.	13.903423559575149
He ’ s there, all that was mortal of him.	21.051806011931284
Peace to his ashes.	28.942389227139646
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland ’ s hearts and hands.	7.759605358196935
More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living.	13.735695533596843
Pray for the repose of the soul of.	25.635394619379515
Does anybody really?	17.506053304924784
Plant him and have done with him.	22.848284836973196
Like down a coalshoot.	16.638081068979556
Then lump them together to save time.	12.609050118839773
All souls ’ day.	13.74388042216767
Twentyseventh I ’ ll be at his grave.	22.818714099117706
Ten shillings for the gardener.	25.654585002808375
He keeps it free of weeds.	12.257868824749673
Old man himself.	17.67971569203876
Bent down double with his shears clipping.	14.379363575449386
Near death ’ s door.	24.687827787747803
Who passed away.	18.034651241977627
Who departed this life.	14.358226915203685
As if they did it of their own accord.	23.243578907470322
Got the shove, all of them.	14.277915776782931
Who kicked the bucket.	13.08423574004297
So and So, wheelwright.	12.69498747039793
I travelled for cork lino.	11.365595851594781
I paid five shillings in the pound.	25.14507187962712
Or a woman ’ s with her saucepan.	21.376940619502687
I cooked good Irish stew.	11.612235358429624
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.	13.191963530058656
Entered into rest the protestants put it.	10.893738914036843
Old Dr Murren ’ s.	13.29047855227119
The great physician called him home.	13.333807015598879
Well it ’ s God ’ s acre for them.	20.090755089913387
Nice country residence.	18.741009038770937
Newly plastered and painted.	13.08529917882189
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the _Church <URL> Marriage ads they never try to beautify.	10.661597277809395
Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil.	6.972252553595622
Better value that for the money.	22.693103530935566
Still, the flowers are more poetical.	20.8435335023836
The other gets rather tiresome, never withering.	9.8996923798976
Expresses nothing.	23.104035123063543
Immortelles.	44.876532221709276
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch.	10.885306081284872
Like stuffed.	23.623288479010405
Hoo! Not a budge out of him.	14.316826459510084
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him.	12.606688631806264
Dead animal even sadder.	12.386972156727506
Silly - Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.	13.028848132670156
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it.	14.404260332966427
Heart on his sleeve.	33.702101136755815
Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart.	15.562633138361798
Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that.	16.05833391835112
Seems anything but pleased.	17.10606194557287
Why this infliction?	14.80120898439253
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy.	17.052286822723918
Apollo that was.	26.05027806367666
How many! All these here once walked round Dublin.	11.236773803815671
Besides how could you remember everybody?	20.974771292520604
Eyes, walk, voice.	17.63994038903216
Well, the voice, yes: gramophone.	24.763237604406154
Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house.	13.965720816446241
Put on poor old greatgrandfather.	14.978103543262238
Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth.	4.4846649453384915
Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face.	23.676185952868252
Otherwise you couldn ’ t remember the face after fifteen years, say.	14.391619830847691
For instance who?	17.32294819855936
For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	12.39783738111576
Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles.	15.097212497375589
Wait.	16.144754643793675
Stop! He looked down intently into a stone crypt.	19.766813993494594
Some animal.	25.17965458233043
Wait.	16.144754643793675
There he goes.	16.69342978022955
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles.	11.394124212297358
An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes.	10.670244171760595
The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.	9.141372513359048
Good hidingplace for treasure.	11.967273701630955
Who lives there?	18.980063043913642
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery.	11.636750754288705
Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn ’ t he?	9.739781926786863
Making his rounds.	17.939586449040586
Tail gone now.	17.73093616155351
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow.	16.459162096839126
Pick the bones clean no matter who it was.	14.10379419174418
Ordinary meat for them.	14.978527049481997
A corpse is meat gone bad.	10.221975599757817
Well and what ’ s cheese?	25.449679485690687
Corpse of milk.	19.815280538446704
I read in that _Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse.	14.504022994112542
Cremation better.	23.66302654126309
Priests dead against it.	14.515827694632708
Devilling for the other firm.	33.66112865476004
Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers.	7.296197505492754
Time of the plague.	34.314111394437234
Quicklime feverpits to eat them.	13.548468091535085
Lethal chamber.	23.71000342814089
Ashes to ashes.	15.713987534192059
Or bury at sea.	14.806086462776411
Where is that Parsee tower of silence?	12.322981600244429
Eaten by birds.	16.251939478146635
Earth, fire, water.	15.776569354464815
Drowning they say is the pleasantest.	23.82109225122168
See your whole life in a flash.	22.189854142088063
But being brought back to life no.	16.55337510854948
Can ’ t bury in the air however.	21.718061649645666
Out of a flying machine.	24.339390469334532
Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down.	11.060313562648545
Underground communication.	21.577729785062214
We learned that from them.	18.341469692410307
Wouldn ’ t be surprised.	17.507416172353718
Regular square feed for them.	12.472149691612152
Got wind of Dignam.	19.989957415158752
They wouldn ’ t care about the smell of it.	18.42293138422949
Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.	6.392969554641167
The gates glimmered in front: still open.	9.852390045954232
Back to the world again.	34.38521003017985
Enough of this place.	24.23808387599687
Brings you a bit nearer every time.	18.995576651752508
Poor papa too.	15.663005042151783
The love that kills.	16.04254917944662
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores.	12.030969633290676
Give you the creeps after a bit.	17.744654672948702
I will appear to you after death.	18.321655542255915
You will see my ghost after death.	11.897291189537942
My ghost will haunt you after death.	9.92659605341268
There is another world after death named hell.	13.829446959925223
I do not like that other world she wrote.	16.963289852209932
No more do I.	18.755570840147293
Plenty to see and hear and feel yet.	15.968157293148762
Feel live warm beings near you.	10.248718456359217
Let them sleep in their maggoty beds.	15.853452697774696
They are not going to get me this innings.	16.018607669408237
Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.	9.854127542562283
Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.	12.406094361542484
Solicitor, I think.	22.547922278464917
I know his face.	15.271844508083609
Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits.	10.016257595278224
Dignam used to be in his office.	28.305133167002644
Convivial evenings.	23.957636184226807
Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses.	13.87236805536349
Heart of gold really.	21.15959228713598
Yes, Menton.	19.726239302032095
Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him.	12.798282274347232
Pure fluke of mine: the bias.	18.191972909251273
Why he took such a rooted dislike to me.	13.328473295518888
Hate at first sight.	20.13721220102842
Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing.	11.003011052469466
Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.	13.152300067382708
Got a dinge in the side of his hat.	21.384380302763663
Carriage probably.	22.020961890230947
— Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.	15.59708315464922
They stopped.	22.89469287811501
— Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.	16.74053205587857
John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.	14.423068848512703
— There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.	11.547135389993363
John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve.	11.004692726784558
He clapped the hat on his head again.	17.696976830510405
— It ’ s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.	11.458484805911521
John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.	14.437049312382895
— Thank you, he said shortly.	15.416773623576654
They walked on towards the gates.	22.689834143236155
Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear.	11.806643476382899
Martin laying down the law.	23.336441913460636
Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.	13.375897548956655
Oyster eyes.	23.755767161935605
Never mind.	23.288411000977444
Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.	10.31005755391118
Get the pull over him that way.	14.55722302391016
Thank you.	18.917318561470015
How grand we are this morning! IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS Before Nelson ’ s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure, Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold ’ s Cross.	5.868155069113671
The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company ’ s timekeeper bawled them off: — Rathgar and Terenure! — Come on, Sandymount Green! Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.	9.439471945255116
— Start, Palmerston Park! THE WEARER OF THE CROWN Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and polished.	8.611016483866711

GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince ’ s stores and bumped them up on the brewery float.	10.80171736455944
On the brewery float bumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince ’ s stores.	9.010696232971958
— There it is, Red Murray said.	14.18537993611055
Alexander Keyes.	24.28798087980982
— Just cut it out, will you?	17.696618270925956
Mr Bloom said, and I ’ ll take it round to the _Telegraph_ office.	17.66196907020999
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office creaked again.	13.690356312587936
Davy Stephens, minute in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a roll of papers under his cape, a king ’ s courier.	14.792700309770641
Red Murray ’ s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes.	14.925618335188398
Scissors and paste.	15.798464844409969
— I ’ ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square.	12.99852385386697
— Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind his ear, we can do him one.	15.254455087072044
— Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod.	18.45502097852884
I ’ ll rub that in.	13.556117615781261
We. WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT Red Murray touched Mr Bloom ’ s arm with the shears and whispered: — Brayden.	8.598488187931684
Dullthudding Guinness ’ s barrels.	24.90215753776563
It passed statelily up the staircase, steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face.	12.723624902768107
The broadcloth back ascended each step: back.	8.030239906639649
All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalus says.	19.773786593727678
Welts of flesh behind on him.	13.921471860720477
Fat folds of neck, fat, neck, fat, neck.	11.147704123093439
— Don ’ t you think his face is like Our Saviour?	14.699006622052432
Red Murray whispered.	17.7019786152291
The door of Ruttledge ’ s office whispered: ee: cree.	11.373368522331184
They always build one door opposite another for the wind to.	13.520941006009933
Way in.	27.645229929759434
Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk.	12.95986759514751
Mary, Martha.	27.08640035171699
Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.	14.035590161397453
— Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.	9.625995333742706
— Yes, Red Murray agreed.	10.918986219064342
But Mario was said to be the picture of Our Saviour.	15.977094288274834
Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs.	7.82156923641874
Hand on his heart.	32.08651650424757
In <URL> Co - ome thou lost one, Co - ome thou dear one! THE CROZIER AND THE PEN — His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.	7.630939383188126
They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish.	12.789510044621228
A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word: _ — Freeman! _ Mr Bloom said slowly: — Well, he is one of our saviours also.	15.934458167508064
A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now reverberating boards.	11.447399416291274
But will he save the circulation?	16.88306511284874
Thumping.	31.115649569681647
Thumping.	31.115649569681647
He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper.	9.526131568334954
Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti ’ s reading closet.	12.610853212985997
WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS Hynes here too: account of the funeral probably.	6.244997284090488

His machineries are pegging away too.	8.669895892176001
Like these, got out of hand: fermenting.	17.691638270733893
Working away, tearing away.	16.346695982269164
And that old grey rat tearing to get in.	14.096291462431212
HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman ’ s spare body, admiring a glossy crown.	8.691232145493016
Strange he never saw his real country.	17.739680160656253

The machines clanked in threefour time.	8.064435292554165
Thump, thump, thump.	10.869084770344932
Now if he got paralysed there and no - one knew how to stop them they ’ d clank on and on the same, print it over and over and up and back.	17.34792634421423
Monkeydoodle the whole thing.	20.527006823065424
Want a cool head.	17.939610729635778
— Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.	13.224478379639372
Soon be calling him my lord mayor.	13.411657663414873
Long John is backing him, they say.	14.510866138080125
The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter.	16.897229467090643
He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.	14.332778114886013
— Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.	10.411317068766802
Mr Bloom stood in his way.	20.78306400446295
— If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb.	13.968244950191743
— Did you?	16.27740396613547
— Mm, Mr Bloom said.	10.231221097174501
Look sharp and you ’ ll catch him.	16.061211232981247
— Thanks, old man, Hynes said.	14.175623533027649
I ’ ll tap him too.	11.632735090857924
He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman ’ s Journal_.	15.314783376662438
Three bob I lent him in Meagher ’ s.	14.249952739135075
Three weeks.	25.074347701560654
Third hint.	22.959309760409862
WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti ’ s desk.	10.112309234729421
— Excuse me, councillor, he said.	12.927542038806319
Keyes, you remember?	31.54457116888899
Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.	9.459082821105946
— He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.	12.537527339121823
The foreman moved his pencil towards it.	9.056727970127692
— But wait, Mr Bloom said.	11.345979890035807
He wants it changed.	14.306309350207112
Keyes, you see.	20.811993080954526
He wants two keys at the top.	17.300267663711647
Hell of a racket they make.	20.444602620197497
He doesn ’ t hear it.	13.674776898106598
Nannan.	51.98932121274747
Iron nerves.	22.44951510817813
Maybe he understands what I.	14.7867803265671
The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.	15.095806134659961
— Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.	15.394208212083061
Let him take that in first.	22.935336687338353
Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman ’ s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.	13.04328208862536
Clank it.	20.17257782316253
Clank it.	20.17257782316253
Miles of it unreeled.	25.78599975063735
What becomes of it after?	24.772096993034456
O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.	8.525945854848652
Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.	15.049925901761815
HOUSE OF KEY (E) S — Like that, see.	10.167251235299323
Two crossed keys here.	13.459154363332502
A circle.	24.32246554615279
Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant.	12.31518605702119
So on.	20.717655563733143
Better not teach him his own business.	17.953411606615504
— You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants.	14.851650220487484
Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys.	18.337992225885557
You see?	24.863294122060946
Do you think that ’ s a good idea?	19.680917607770365
The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.	9.959571954032585
— The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys.	18.14554542382521
You know, councillor, the Manx parliament.	19.496476716460318
Innuendo of home rule.	15.988573979635197
Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man.	20.207874420323943
Catches the eye, you see.	22.293404543630565
Can you do that?	25.5657320545881
I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <URL> But then if he didn ’ t know only make it awkward for him.	11.533106261271081
Better not.	22.97813108838338
— We can do that, the foreman said.	18.880029187679394
Have you the design?	21.120342777617648
— I can get it, Mr Bloom said.	13.549068776565269
It was in a Kilkenny paper.	18.890915718870637
He has a house there too.	16.39350622802973
I ’ ll just run out and ask him.	14.112437530471935
Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention.	20.73131254976157
Longfelt want.	25.04096645274837
So on.	20.717655563733143
The foreman thought for an instant.	12.648320950385253
— We can do that, he said.	12.37100053305278
Let him give us a three months ’ renewal.	13.243443994338824
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage.	14.978793204612343
He began to check it silently.	10.772316287572876
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.	9.843588615893538
ORTHOGRAPHICAL Want to be sure of his spelling.	24.346837659662743
Proof fever.	25.038543438146807
Martin Cunningham forgot to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning.	10.859095355200001
It is amusing to view the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it?	5.451941889783104
double ess ment of a harassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled pear under a cemetery wall.	10.120469360476601
Silly, isn ’ t it?	12.922694136662967
Cemetery put in of course on account of the symmetry.	21.645871276371352
I should have said when he clapped on his topper.	21.643390103303624
Thank you.	18.917318561470015
I ought to have said something about an old hat or something.	16.965320588259278
No. I could have said.	17.71093972386181
Looks as good as new now.	14.18436112340817
See his phiz then.	11.527521355542813
Sllt.	31.115649569681647
The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its flyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers.	8.945060998924921
Sllt.	31.115649569681647
Almost human the way it sllt to call attention.	13.787155746710287
Doing its level best to speak.	13.488262468776506
That door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut.	12.625318471444329
Everything speaks in its own way.	18.004016787150825

It ’ s to be repeated in the <URL> Where ’ s what ’ s his name?	19.63024992550586
He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.	13.498230661772594
— Monks, sir?	16.400941207841807
— Ay. Where ’ s Monks?	18.105172485324484
— Monks! Mr Bloom took up his cutting.	19.810271566217917
Time to get out.	21.04881128111884
— Then I ’ ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you ’ ll give it a good place I know.	19.469984108292987
— Monks! — Yes, sir.	13.070527007892288
Three months ’ renewal.	13.716360274017966

A DAYFATHER He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed, spectacled, aproned.	11.344382792884387
Old Monks, the dayfather.	31.190231152168415
Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs ’ ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned.	9.365508710560471
Nearing the end of his tether now.	18.393304218303072
Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I ’ d say.	23.117001692930735

Plain Jane, no damn nonsense.	15.604759545269847
AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.	7.452731546489181
Reads it backwards first.	13.102123383835112
Quickly he does it.	18.026560566343992

Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu_.	11.782487454818579
No, that ’ s the other.	19.49392384441549
Then the twelve brothers, Jacob ’ s sons.	16.245022735642397
And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher.	33.98548682246571
And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat.	14.693880445738229
Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well.	19.465554655484727
Justice it means but it ’ s everybody eating everyone else.	14.416659489248255
That ’ s what life is after all.	14.160607572639412
Practice makes perfect.	17.111129870993334
Seems to see with his fingers.	27.04848875468606
Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing.	17.98618711203524
Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps.	23.023529131210854
Better phone him up first.	16.293647177664063
Number?	47.84085941932481
Yes.	14.82237916275066
Same as Citron ’ s house.	15.113364664845982

ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP He went down the house staircase.	11.834240297532471
Who the deuce scrawled all over those walls with matches?	9.472033005002439
Looks as if they did it for a bet.	28.446787188759384
Heavy greasy smell there always is in those works.	14.206628441221664
Lukewarm glue in Thom ’ s next door when I was there.	14.964598096024918
He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose.	11.386448254910327
Citronlemon?	44.75790071189311
Ah, the soap I put there.	26.621706264656808
Lose it out of that pocket.	24.072673997878553
Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.	13.96323918123436
What perfume does your wife use?	11.25395371419821
I could go home still: tram: something I forgot.	11.462642822669812
Just to see: before: dressing.	13.863922895322872
No. Here.	16.56601015368081
No. A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.	10.548210855838635
Know who that is.	18.69404684842438
What ’ s up?	17.997262638706243
Ned Lambert it is.	16.049287773031274
He entered softly.	17.788700135498964
ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA — The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane.	9.229001691951018
Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert ’ s quizzing face, asked of it sourly: — Agonising Christ, wouldn ’ t it give you a heartburn on your arse?	15.074693420700255
Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on: — _Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way, tho ’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters of Neptune ’ s blue domain, ’ mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’ neath the shadows cast o ’ er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest_.	10.222545009367781
What about that, Simon?	27.655130272560623
he asked over the fringe of his newspaper.	23.817588333239044
How ’ s that for high?	20.66013571694271
— Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.	11.15136999472812
Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating: — _The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_.	14.643439366096917
O boys! O boys! — And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.	18.598255715103893
— That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window.	15.118882063355155
I don ’ t want to hear any more of the stuff.	18.380506671691776
High falutin stuff.	14.687629566539716
Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.	12.863555696578764
Rather upsets a man ’ s day, a funeral does.	22.67517571238438
He has influence they say.	12.480757344753235
Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle.	17.011368213798963
Close on ninety they say.	11.616767057169614
Subleader for his death written this long time perhaps.	16.16208758678109
Living to spite them.	13.23170507784585
Might go first himself.	13.91101879389422
Johnny, make room for your uncle.	18.662407615450917
The right honourable Hedges Eyre Chatterton.	8.858346687025136
Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on gale days.	9.478388012306754
Windfall when he kicks out.	19.149231931320735
Alleluia.	51.98932121274747
— Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.	8.64371730004174
— What is it?	10.593475497978059
Mr Bloom asked.	11.735074165646148
— A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered with pomp of tone.	8.070858433198373
_Our lovely land_.	14.647936814476596
SHORT BUT TO THE POINT — Whose land?	6.939471016813834
Mr Bloom said simply.	14.671365450615012
— Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews.	14.248773028482901
With an accent on the whose.	22.55182469209925
— Dan Dawson ’ s land Mr Dedalus said.	13.574077099203318
— Is it his speech last night?	15.013634423296775
Mr Bloom asked.	11.735074165646148
— But listen to this, he said.	12.982841015795657
The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in.	23.409839418844445
— Excuse me, J.	15.365379235644303
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy said, entering.	15.31764621413257
Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.	11.720114873496344
— I beg yours, he said.	11.507230567397908
— Good day, Jack.	15.07226496709731
— Come in.	14.267053687179443
Come in.	20.71989339324605
— Good day.	12.77343778960995
— How are you, Dedalus?	24.45336980592378
And yourself?	24.082819323271785
J.	9.525932994442917
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy shook his head.	11.200221586521765
SAD Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be.	12.895278422186449
Decline, poor chap.	19.401744275665358
That hectic flush spells finis for a man.	10.92932263077367
Touch and go with him.	18.322860332158243
What ’ s in the wind, I wonder.	22.067629625977908
Money worry.	19.698674193045512
— _Or again if we but climb the serried mountain <URL> — You ’ re looking extra.	9.340246727087225
— Is the editor to be seen?	20.44401561741426
J.	9.525932994442917
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy asked, looking towards the inner door.	15.330265731991332
— Very much so, professor MacHugh said.	10.778014003618425
To be seen and heard.	19.115903176299053
He ’ s in his sanctum with Lenehan.	13.786327678501658
J.	9.525932994442917
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file.	16.775755074457752
Practice dwindling.	21.577706852610767
A mighthavebeen.	20.463129549418564
Losing heart.	23.416328924852145

Debts of honour.	18.552343921159263
Reaping the whirlwind.	14.648010810549117
Used to get good retainers from D.	12.116693586522263
and T.	10.267736432776289
Fitzgerald.	53.25925464381786
Their wigs to show the grey matter.	14.407953314966989
Brains on their sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin.	16.74971260073336
Believe he does some literary work for the _Express_ with Gabriel Conroy.	13.672474152212995
Wellread fellow.	24.167503692481056
Myles Crawford began on the <URL> Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening.	15.785223994942228
Weathercocks.	44.876532221709276
Hot and cold in the same breath.	21.46494228908296
Wouldn ’ t know which to believe.	15.695068157227329
One story good till you hear the next.	15.606742973997449
Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over.	20.451663917503286
Hail fellow well met the next moment.	13.470362123101774
— Ah, listen to this for God ’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded.	12.666136205373215
_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks... _ — Bombast! the professor broke in testily.	10.402540127195879
Enough of the inflated windbag! — _Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our souls, as it were... _ — Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said.	14.085169801985487
Blessed and eternal God! Yes?	16.628978598324657
Is he taking anything for it?	19.741798743862816
_ — As ’ twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland ’ s portfolio, unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight... _ HIS NATIVE DORIC — The moon, professor MacHugh said.	8.0062301022726
He forgot Hamlet.	17.81783231399666
Shite and onions! That ’ ll do, Ned.	17.104206563421315
Life is too short.	21.42547826365165
He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.	9.59888732828633
Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight.	9.941157289516596
An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh ’ s unshaven blackspectacled face.	11.385564304498423
— Doughy Daw! he cried.	11.63235030867407
WHAT WETHERUP SAID All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff.	9.101058233532468
He was in the bakery line too, wasn ’ t he?	15.73314367476673
Why they call him Doughy Daw.	14.123682812391117
Feathered his nest well anyhow.	10.666565329808556
Daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor.	19.075818963845887
Hooked that nicely.	16.0299110355981
Entertainments.	49.9750299142878
Open house.	23.71860995865202
Big blowout.	20.21711057282564
Wetherup always said that.	20.030483269352466
Get a grip of them by the stomach.	22.05648396796875
The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in.	11.374841214104293
The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked: — What is it?	14.019915269794566
— And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.	8.4431541051888
— Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.	12.859596810797324
— Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat.	16.98247930903151
I must get a drink after that.	19.258797961763037
— Drink! the editor cried.	11.822232864889324
No drinks served before mass.	11.429715826615695
— Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out.	16.87001217359062
Come on, Ned.	20.659727288384346
Ned Lambert sidled down from the table.	13.638571003854127
The editor ’ s blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom ’ s face, shadowed by a smile.	16.202590348002033
— Will you join us, Myles?	16.00483503910509
Ned Lambert asked.	13.19959248234421
MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED — North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece.	9.355844889040277
We won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers! — Where was that, Myles?	15.26683437518564
Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps.	17.567238657287945
— In Ohio! the editor shouted.	11.877556720802755
— So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.	13.61049404321352
Passing out he whispered to J.	13.30617023678149
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy: — Incipient jigs.	12.551228815708752
Sad case.	24.887086238146715
— Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.	10.169307953995665
My Ohio! — A perfect cretic! the professor said.	12.783370638049126
Long, short and long.	14.194090265953777
O, HARP EOLIAN! He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.	11.445880091023037
— Bingbang, bangbang.	10.400770941643671
Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.	14.637286801288687
— Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said.	15.896001805343383
I just want to phone about an ad.	15.026493259932025
He went in.	18.425103683413944
— What about that leader this evening?	12.829470013846638
professor MacHugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.	17.862518108174367
— That ’ ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly.	10.855481122327467
Never you fret.	14.589224868214176
Hello, Jack.	19.726302095169352
That ’ s all right.	10.658339576539126
— Good day, Myles, J.	12.9208033432898
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file.	12.606111009857043
Is that Canada swindle case on today?	10.238431401124881
The telephone whirred inside.	11.518605452354185
— Twentyeight...	15.580227638008767
Double four...	18.695631570164803
Yes.	14.82237916275066
SPOT THE WINNER Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_ ’ s tissues.	14.471013716841291
— Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup?	14.319242247521451
he asked.	10.295735601437203
Sceptre with O.	19.571313726784354
Madden up.	23.34844212629285
He tossed the tissues on to the table.	15.685373619337284
Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.	16.081823785897814
— Hush, Lenehan said.	10.774436159979533
I hear feetstoops.	16.956181367637196
Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps.	14.398044086090128
The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.	14.477412825458591
— It wasn ’ t me, sir.	14.91916263490347
It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.	14.183244496928962
— Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said.	17.343927487956933
There ’ s a hurricane blowing.	12.358613407558883
Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.	15.53905024853792
— Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said.	17.263996352370192
It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir.	10.401090761416096
He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.	11.16716748996664
— Him, sir.	15.590519308668885
— Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.	17.967352890342863
He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.	15.035139991901456
J.	9.525932994442917
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking: — Continued on page six, column four.	9.292406435861523
— Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.	13.25814612356875
Is the boss...?	17.59974984542111
Yes, _Telegraph_...	13.373958813815724
To where?	26.72640511784576
Aha! Which auction rooms?...	9.976379950850887
Aha! I see...	20.570259669502033
Right.	26.368445767368986
I ’ ll catch him.	11.846513109295165
A COLLISION ENSUES The bell whirred again as he rang off.	9.0442826534278
He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.	15.250881041936003
— _Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.	12.197590981859054
— My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip.	13.097626632904184
Are you hurt?	19.76325495318825
I ’ m in a hurry.	16.65661603269471
— Knee, Lenehan said.	10.227220042689959
He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee: — The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.	12.26275952333846
— Sorry, Mr Bloom said.	11.876883591105377
He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused.	17.49577193342468
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy slapped the heavy pages over.	10.877644357120907
The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps: We are the boys of Wexford Who fought with heart and hand.	13.049887321847002
EXIT BLOOM — I ’ m just running round to Bachelor ’ s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes ’ s.	14.055617925793591
Want to fix it up.	12.953003187460286
They tell me he ’ s round there in Dillon ’ s.	19.1195195964288
He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces.	15.915823105603938
The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.	13.844537463945647
— Begone! he said.	11.507173321081117
The world is before you.	15.009450530682852
— Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.	16.25527459342414
J.	9.525932994442917
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan ’ s hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment.	15.179854068211798
— He ’ ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind.	14.759497370058101
Look at the young scamps after him.	16.29248825663708
— Show.	21.72585292261706
Where?	20.307631490117476
Lenehan cried, running to the window.	24.19985617407369
A STREET CORTÈGE Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom ’ s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots.	13.116079066468824
— Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and you ’ ll kick.	16.21194259246927
O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk.	12.148235162720018
Small nines.	21.577683920281174
Steal upon larks.	14.685849698345063
He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J.	8.59583391771382
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.	11.806820537848868
— What ’ s that?	11.872792500682896
Myles Crawford said with a start.	21.989606925016883
Where are the other two gone?	22.62763754584816
— Who?	12.787285610070553
the professor said, turning.	12.874413613207363
They ’ re gone round to the Oval for a drink.	17.425889841726605
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall.	15.515190124616112
Came over last night.	15.086265754664032
— Come on then, Myles Crawford said.	11.1429387184457
Where ’ s my hat?	21.50914547791246
He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket.	13.318581148001101
They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.	16.80737539494868
— He ’ s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.	16.637677516769195
— Seems to be, J.	16.76786772789042
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems.	13.73860537979323
Who has the most matches?	24.780296015290144
THE CALUMET OF PEACE He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself.	12.690848520475734
Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn.	12.573894264019195
J.	9.525932994442917
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy opened his case again and offered it.	12.055073245194064
— _Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.	11.616116083271002
The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.	18.67984086798977
He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh: ’ Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, ’ Twas empire charmed thy heart.	7.103270217440177
The professor grinned, locking his long lips.	8.78659440633855
— Eh?	17.76306839242804
You bloody old Roman empire?	15.687648541692
Myles Crawford said.	10.256759566061492
He took a cigarette from the open case.	17.691844275283643
Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said: — Silence for my brandnew riddle! — _Imperium romanum_, J.	13.642917965716448
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy said gently.	11.462322922449573
It sounds nobler than British or Brixton.	8.071468301359921
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.	14.325390854380794
Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.	12.139344996754707
— That ’ s it, he said.	12.002009913543953
We are the fat.	19.002757459007128
You and I are the fat in the fire.	27.70811642274855
We haven ’ t got the chance of a snowball in hell.	17.073094920567392
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME — Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws.	8.885378104664152
We mustn ’ t be led away by words, by sounds of words.	14.67030076800941
We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative.	8.963930109503378
He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing: — What was their civilisation?	8.32161501611353
Vast, I allow: but vile.	21.247352383858026
Cloacae: sewers.	14.710701146333635
The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to be here.	15.597186908942462
Let us build an altar to Jehovah_.	9.416408302378091
The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession.	12.08338857260751
He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to be here.	16.15275380762611
Let us construct a <URL> — Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said.	11.706278105456553
Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness ’ s, were partial to the running stream.	17.13011365091688
— They were nature ’ s gentlemen, J.	17.207607545623926
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy murmured.	13.434486522460526
But we have also Roman law.	13.864794467272162
— And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.	7.276773895959055
— Do you know that story about chief baron Palles?	8.98317208819398
J.	9.525932994442917
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy asked.	11.626564698444845
Everything was going swimmingly...	14.585105183443522
— First my riddle, Lenehan said.	10.373206386369835
Are you ready?	20.38569795825992
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from the hallway.	10.21654707452021
Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.	22.840372785238284
— _Entrez, mes enfants! _ Lenehan cried.	10.551790012496875
Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety.	9.27434416762404
— How do you do?	13.671867659445855
the editor said, holding out a hand.	19.281540022859208
Come in.	20.71989339324605
Your governor is just gone.	12.4238871466408
???	13.063153586005889
Lenehan said to all: — Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline?	16.096245421716453
Reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply.	7.346070263153736
Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.	14.81040541332945
— Who?	12.787285610070553
the editor asked.	11.60595170146982
Bit torn off.	17.046300072403167
— Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.	9.352959288954084
— That old pelters, the editor said.	12.339596275852795
Who tore it?	20.929096383457598
Was he short taken?	15.519515223252716
On swift sail flaming From storm and south He comes, pale vampire, Mouth to my mouth.	7.9033341210208015
— Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their shoulders.	14.41962555530255
Foot and mouth?	23.1461403051719
Are you turned...?	21.425089791116203
Bullockbefriending bard.	22.214954394131457
SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT — Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing.	10.601629232215302
The letter is not mine.	18.724382905565598
Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to...	14.536629472531532
— O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too.	18.914659284499407
The bloodiest old tartar God ever made.	8.37051279886539
By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter ’ s face in the Star and Garter.	18.034020037386206
Oho! A woman brought sin into the world.	15.145506661515068
For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks.	11.768794686400117
O ’ Rourke, prince of Breffni.	9.088362896585705
— Is he a widower?	15.691799595180806
Stephen asked.	15.442182356790978
— Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the typescript.	17.804117133563803
Emperor ’ s horses.	33.00678376245635
Habsburg.	44.876532221709276
An Irishman saved his life on the ramparts of Vienna.	14.560644865805067
Don ’ t you forget! Maximilian Karl O ’ Donnell, graf von Tirconnell in Ireland.	7.165530059693234
Going to be trouble there one day.	18.76971042407642
Wild geese.	20.531690611469006
O yes, every time.	18.75483299741889
Don ’ t you forget that! — The moot point is did he forget it, J.	14.947054145770652
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy said quietly, turning a horseshoe paperweight.	10.02941788529089
Saving princes is a thank you job.	16.93144912212235
Professor MacHugh turned on him.	14.913041570208843
— And if not?	20.085249911997714
he said.	10.465399985534118
— I ’ ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began.	13.792810700448458
A Hungarian it was one day...	20.621054711913203
LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED — We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.	8.395000776992507
Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination.	31.76100007487476
We were never loyal to the successful.	22.939318315538156
We serve them.	16.988557720561587
I teach the blatant Latin language.	11.36832195823008
I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money.	12.870531668861608
Material domination.	19.698757934423995
_Dominus! _ Lord! Where is the spirituality?	25.065382181132353
Lord Jesus?	28.702151325878013
Lord Salisbury?	22.585276394056493
But the Greek! KYRIE ELEISON! A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.	9.087785091813455
— The Greek! he said again.	17.964221549696216
_Kyrios! _ Shining word! The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not.	14.768265455575822
_Kyrie! _ The radiance of the intellect.	27.74748335042812
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind.	21.396852496955688
_Kyrie eleison! _ The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.	15.628409178530331
We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium, _ that went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami.	12.367099845518458
They went under.	20.22172823390124
Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece.	8.7670275924577
Loyal to a lost cause.	21.943976922046506
He strode away from them towards the window.	18.124219045986795
— They went forth to battle, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell.	11.723741251233202
— Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise.	13.791704244818996
Owing to a brick received in the latter half of the _matinée_.	26.02455663280276
Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus! He whispered then near Stephen ’ s ear: LENEHAN ’ S LIMERICK — _There ’ s a ponderous pundit MacHugh Who wears goggles of ebony hue.	8.832096346754037
As he mostly sees double To wear them why trouble?	8.803323645183752
I can ’ t see the Joe Miller.	13.167574750405635
Can you? _ In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says.	14.294971051804403
Whose mother is beastly dead.	13.45478159470759
Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.	11.700548160912271
— That ’ ll be all right, he said.	11.131193316036434
I ’ ll read the rest after.	16.057173126962706
That ’ ll be all right.	10.918345480107986
Lenehan extended his hands in protest.	17.73971238527911
— But my riddle! he said.	11.520863726167901
What opera is like a railwayline?	17.72301809010753
— Opera?	23.224858223979748
Mr O ’ Madden Burke ’ s sphinx face reriddled.	11.902294224182459
Lenehan announced gladly: — _The Rose of Castile_.	13.41273193280621
See the wheeze?	19.22741203559497
Rows of cast steel.	12.918696263252457
Gee! He poked Mr O ’ Madden Burke mildly in the spleen.	16.227072271126442
Mr O ’ Madden Burke fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.	11.535430693921946
— Help! he sighed.	16.27878016917187
I feel a strong weakness.	17.1565841948254
Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.	12.894138426288869
— Paris, past and present, he said.	14.65768874509068
You look like communards.	15.077822477240984
— Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J.	11.30963834658306
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy said in quiet mockery.	12.721927690795082
Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you?	10.796451771505502
You look as though you had done the deed.	13.849828460457713
General Bobrikoff.	20.80251593625774
OMNIUM GATHERUM — We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.	13.618922320816525
— All the talents, Myles Crawford said.	8.46424268780296
Law, the classics...	24.824591885191378
— The turf, Lenehan put in.	16.591639372721957
— Literature, the press.	24.52900866319342
— If Bloom were here, the professor said.	12.985666816809548
The gentle art of advertisement.	14.793906729349702
— And Madam Bloom, Mr O ’ Madden Burke added.	14.356673278819336
The vocal muse.	14.709174904337939
Dublin ’ s prime favourite.	25.12852914594524
Lenehan gave a loud cough.	18.34925643072198
— Ahem! he said very softly.	15.962627864210829
O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a cold in the park.	18.058459620290563
The gate was open.	14.294924787342506
“ YOU CAN DO IT! ” The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen ’ s shoulder.	8.310904609073694
— I want you to write something for me, he said.	16.12863099903948
Something with a bite in it.	21.37683893944599
You can do it.	16.90282480360216
I see it in your face.	19.35152803896895
_In the lexicon of youth_...	8.375623980608575
See it in your face.	18.557814275663354
See it in your eye.	20.966299760671678
Lazy idle little schemer.	9.98274429434772
— Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective.	8.624332448124045
Great nationalist meeting in Borris - in - Ossory.	9.038478129854248
All balls! Bulldosing the public! Give them something with a bite in it.	11.243924126855246
Put us all into it, damn its soul.	18.79229804337263
Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M ’ Carthy.	9.394415295059787
— We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	8.072439179930466
Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.	19.741189384588203
— He wants you for the pressgang, J.	13.713658616831614
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy said.	9.253323995634037
THE GREAT GALLAHER — You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.	12.90599901962392
Wait a minute.	17.380146847186506
We ’ ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence.	14.017468201718819
Gallaher, that was a pressman for you.	23.058610422603298
That was a pen.	24.745801159892103
You know how he made his mark?	19.369508227143143
I ’ ll tell you.	9.964143596095205
That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known.	11.011123207700837
I ’ ll show you.	11.835025879703373
He pushed past them to the files.	23.64738050561677
The _New York World_ cabled for a special.	12.208018534828016
Remember that time?	25.861461882281322
Professor MacHugh nodded.	16.260057838862814
— _New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.	11.776232693092123
Where it took place.	16.177830705856252
Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean.	14.991408629269364
Joe Brady and the rest of them.	18.819200691725833
Where Skin - the - Goat drove the car.	8.885181884159428
Whole route, see?	15.703662223617407
— Skin - the - Goat, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	9.335412333364298
Fitzharris.	51.98932121274747
He has that cabman ’ s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge.	15.660850480939537
Holohan told me.	19.99666520180431
You know Holohan?	17.705208714832434
— Hop and carry one, is it?	14.754810034791287
Myles Crawford said.	10.256759566061492
— And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for the corporation.	17.998102865385967
A night watchman.	16.380341282628013
Stephen turned in surprise.	18.234441211339476
— Gumley?	24.526790112888815
he said.	10.465399985534118
You don ’ t say so?	16.606908568958882
— Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily.	10.547476562079591
Look at here.	15.129753491627019
What did Ignatius Gallaher do?	12.485221919555945
I ’ ll tell you.	9.964143596095205
Inspiration of genius.	17.919930772630348
Cabled right away.	16.98004403734563
Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of <NUM> March?	12.394357565245544
Right.	26.368445767368986
Have you got that?	15.874278349440909
He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.	16.974368468603334
— Take page four, advertisement for Bransome ’ s coffee, let us say.	11.706260947334252
Have you got that?	15.874278349440909
Right.	26.368445767368986
The telephone whirred.	14.43571999453805
A DISTANT VOICE — I ’ ll answer it, the professor said, going.	17.160777785042438
— B is parkgate.	12.704302714888208
Good.	25.782918879857334
His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.	8.29079704126279
— T is viceregal lodge.	11.114007103517672
C is where murder took place.	13.007872804924896
K is Knockmaroon gate.	11.93208677534341
The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock ’ s wattles.	23.498074206554733
An illstarched dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat.	13.424830519396197
— Hello?	18.83250039104444
_Evening Telegraph_ here...	16.248755320259946
Hello?...	15.58964357184087
Who ’ s there?...	15.939021179622126
Yes...	13.877945632704913
Yes...	13.877945632704913
Yes.	14.82237916275066
— F to P is the route Skin - the - Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh.	6.9380436218329
<URL>. Got that?	18.4144926674068
X is Davy ’ s publichouse in upper Leeson street.	11.683860944024612
The professor came to the inner door.	20.118129855427224
— Bloom is at the telephone, he said.	17.57881185183407
— Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly.	19.16751406992495
X is Davy ’ s publichouse, see?	14.64523609541517
CLEVER, VERY — Clever, Lenehan said.	7.689549079381458
Very.	40.926698858146054
— Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody history.	18.40215390651625
Nightmare from which you will never awake.	19.04751898014931
— I saw it, the editor said proudly.	19.545971263428044
I was present.	21.685792292259833
Dick Adams, the besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and myself.	17.887264942579485
Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing: — Madam, I ’ m Adam.	19.727563266696425
And Able was I ere I saw Elba.	12.874220407537207
— History! Myles Crawford cried.	11.114823744194924
The Old Woman of Prince ’ s street was there first.	15.281064990693363
There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that.	9.508002214915336
Out of an advertisement.	24.627975727194414

Pyatt! He was all their daddies! — The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the brother - in - law of Chris Callinan.	14.744297000888153
— Hello?...	10.87774732645605
Are you there?...	15.65759117622755
Yes, he ’ s here still.	17.991698874455814
Come across yourself.	17.299906974507426
— Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh?	16.904676943586235
the editor cried.	9.200851982263885
He flung the pages down.	14.55393303710963
— Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O ’ Madden Burke.	12.580573404973906
— Very smart, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	10.929690641573796
Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.	15.45498296901617
— Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder...	14.462400249071823
— O yes, J.	14.027786483711733
O ’ Molloy said eagerly.	10.787121831873614
Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she ’ d buy a view of Dublin.	14.617142444061209

Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O ’ Hagan.	17.93014147133885
Eh?	23.62115905831347
Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.	18.63719477916285
His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.	6.407415467748023
Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss?	14.05655825267406
Why did you write it then?	19.654649971341236
RHYMES AND REASONS Mouth, south.	9.582665416848553
Is the mouth south someway?	16.805553784448513
Or the south a mouth?	14.919058351534739
Must be some.	19.256176996523777
South, pout, out, shout, drouth.	11.553885646399005

O ’ Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.	12.704092979837165
— My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false construction on my words.	14.12471746098894
I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running away with you.	10.263934371792311
Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke?	7.8388031511298095
Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly ’ s Budget_, _Pue ’ s Occurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_.	12.13163228502557
Why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside?	13.638374048735514

Psha! — Well, J.	19.665876195064037

O ’ Molloy said, Bushe <URL>., for example.	17.286661766446635
— Bushe?	24.885977089871297
the editor said.	8.31929346462128
Well, yes: Bushe, yes.	15.273213026193668
He has a strain of it in his blood.	22.64791613011602
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.	14.862617256879368
— He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for....	19.88777353566338

J.	9.525932994442917
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly: — One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe.	14.914906216716156
It was in that case of fratricide, the Childs murder case.	18.443713167476286
Bushe defended him.	16.787417235728423
_And in the porches of mine ear did <URL> By the way how did he find that out?	18.620283737707283
He died in his sleep.	27.325979152670914
Or the other story, beast with two backs?	16.34008586759269
— What was that?	16.965102751087436
the professor asked.	11.466369452424562
ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM — He spoke on the law of evidence, J.	12.717263565576753
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy said, of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_.	12.227169642027494
And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.	13.323786748140433
— Ha. — A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced.	16.515754982464475
J.	9.525932994442917
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy took out his cigarettecase.	13.691729708553003
False lull.	21.460269733513158
Something quite ordinary.	17.06831488951362
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.	11.145963033177676
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.	13.026996127420178
A POLISHED PERIOD J.	8.99329143809448
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy resumed, moulding his words: — He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to <URL> His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.	10.718834778335722
— Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.	12.385745515830719
— The divine afflatus, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said.	9.25013196715261

J.	9.525932994442917
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy asked Stephen.	12.062717231638361
Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.	11.894589920554743
He took a cigarette from the case.	19.00154139615285
J.	9.525932994442917
J.	9.525932994442917

Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying: — Muchibus thankibus.	10.215100014252497
A MAN OF HIGH MORALE — Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.	9.717075670160094
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy said to Stephen.	14.186274909687942
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A.	14.418171763398691
E.	17.860184031499212
the mastermystic?	10.96751826474075
She was a nice old bag of tricks.	16.198950622740675
A.	12.889029081532971
E.	17.860184031499212
has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness.	15.157241674239483
Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A.	16.490543150483283
E. ’ s leg.	28.38735332090384
He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.	16.38995028054857
Speaking about me.	20.059123731812328
What did he say?	16.767818326391467
What did he say?	16.767818326391467
What did he say about me?	16.61457748714868
Don ’ t ask.	16.815324564159535
— No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.	11.822814141644875
Wait a moment.	15.272557989519207
Let me say one thing.	14.998734784983286
The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society.	12.680049733497041
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.	13.753223518734913
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said: — You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.	13.350268019461556
Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.	19.309559654910295
— He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.	9.102609732145165
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy said, rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission.	14.134996747806811
— He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child ’ s frock.	21.05712834442399
Go on.	22.393594358867215
— It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man ’ s contumely upon the new movement.	11.84251094268985
It was then a new movement.	20.331035337662552
We were weak, therefore worthless.	10.348394425770522
He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.	12.895784639398094
IMPROMPTU In ferial tone he addressed J.	8.588681354938329
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy: — Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.	19.965855860619644
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall.	17.11053651520236
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it.	10.381243642762268
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.	11.41633222459634
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.	11.312788617925783
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy ’ s towards Stephen ’ s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking.	19.018681137937445
His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair.	10.640152546935465
Still seeking, he said: — When Fitzgibbon ’ s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.	12.733426450108583
Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.	24.562039099555776
He raised his head firmly.	19.990961803054816
His eyes bethought themselves once more.	10.649996112465981
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.	10.983028089473937
He began: _ — Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend.	12.142334837245345
It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful <URL> His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech.	15.087431097899175
_And let our crooked <URL> Noble words coming.	8.85236634581328
Could you try your hand at it yourself?	18.766488192124207
_ — And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.	14.986842976260393
I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to <URL> FROM THE FATHERS It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted.	10.468529972560768
Ah, curse you! That ’ s saint Augustine.	16.828073681880117
_ — Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language?	12.355940272423325
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.	11.254255093055148
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe.	7.131431851223326
You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a <URL> Nile.	12.964169264193233
Child, man, effigy.	20.54295190826373
By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.	6.982160643440215
_ — You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas.	6.904385003780207
Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms.	10.150550814506017
Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our <URL> A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech.	10.309793538756345
He lifted his voice above it boldly: _ — But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day.	12.825049035364177
He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai ’ s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the <URL> He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.	14.498491826335275
OMINOUS — FOR HIM! J.	8.084976854167028
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy said not without regret: — And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.	10.788543549431546
— A — sudden — at — the — moment — though — from — lingering — illness — often — previously — expectorated — demise, Lenehan added.	5.841196539500919
And with a great future behind him.	19.319976149482635
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase.	8.702224744985001
— That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.	13.800216001719255
Gone with the wind.	34.538593207217396
Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.	14.9901016581896
Miles of ears of porches.	11.20065421551498
The tribune ’ s words, howled and scattered to the four winds.	16.952801749025333
A people sheltered within his voice.	12.210874631637385
Dead noise.	24.34724530562564
Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was.	15.22968515966599
Love and laud him: me no more.	13.191746249655074
I have money.	19.511933468233746
— Gentlemen, Stephen said.	11.430444685470382
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn?	13.868622460958253
— You take my breath away.	14.047728051948287
It is not perchance a French compliment?	12.56514262118277
Mr O ’ Madden Burke asked.	12.030822612715951
’ Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.	8.083320440746927
— That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved.	10.547829299315113
All that are in favour say ay, Lenehan announced.	16.52376024146442
The contrary no.	17.181162873074843
I declare it carried.	13.85931789786395
To which particular boosing shed...?	11.679523794978133
My casting vote is: Mooney ’ s! He led the way, admonishing: — We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not?	12.31572757282615
Yes, we will not.	22.35600505233308
By no manner of means.	14.464498182777842
Mr O ’ Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally ’ s lunge of his umbrella: — Lay on, Macduff! — Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the shoulder.	16.039432626812175
Let us go.	18.258165093546673
Where are those blasted keys?	13.656096706491637
He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.	14.407877680176313
— Foot and mouth.	13.072517915198082
I know.	14.383905838937961
That ’ ll be all right.	10.918345480107986
That ’ ll go in.	16.971845576013706
Where are they?	20.31178042615015
That ’ s all right.	10.658339576539126
He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.	15.737037912625508
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen: — I hope you will live to see it published.	19.266225832238987
Myles, one moment.	28.533245051309724
He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.	14.50518276700874
— Come along, Stephen, the professor said.	15.546603107639541
That is fine, isn ’ t it?	12.217743988389559
It has the prophetic vision.	14.939219249510277
_Fuit Ilium! _ The sack of windy Troy.	12.941231126976943

The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling: — Racing special! Dublin.	12.652927912272457
I have much, much to learn.	18.153706656387797
They turned to the left along Abbey street.	16.17794805195108
— I have a vision too, Stephen said.	14.16909835412882
— Yes?	16.620972851440886
the professor said, skipping to get into step.	14.392500123229516
Crawford will follow.	17.32637456632244
Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran: — Racing special! DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN Dubliners.	10.855321008402441
— Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally ’ s lane.	9.89623805759905
— Where is that?	16.19028203464353
the professor asked.	11.466369452424562
— Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.	9.539254340774159
Damp night reeking of hungry dough.	8.547006927469198
Against the wall.	18.971630434582423

Let there be life.	15.395243790208589
— They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	15.873510614238965
They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox.	11.870394765554485
They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife.	13.71422371849596
Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers.	14.03349358875202
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.	12.848179513548908
— Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.	9.530099981746584
LIFE ON THE RAW — They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins, proprietress...	7.0639418079842144
They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson ’ s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn.	16.335438066322588
They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.	13.410234138515488
Glory be to God.	17.326944624741287
They had no idea it was that high.	21.463229756669573
Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe.	7.882939807930816
Anne Kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father.	12.492936300815417
Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.	10.45308566446095
— Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice.	14.740968533010635
Vestal virgins.	22.277806255541787
I can see them.	18.825845653587518
What ’ s keeping our friend?	16.92216872999064
He turned.	16.337976297193315
A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering.	9.830864004424045
Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking with J.	15.405595406683364
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy.	13.657802444923718
— Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.	15.227366648940036
He set off again to walk by Stephen ’ s side.	19.196790013182945
RETURN OF BLOOM — Yes, he said.	11.543900528384311
I see them.	19.459122212954817
Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called: — Mr Crawford! A moment! — _Telegraph_! Racing special! — What is it?	10.986922492681026
Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.	15.320803886854183
A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom ’ s face: — Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows! INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR — Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket.	12.1698021997938
I spoke with Mr Keyes just now.	13.550336878445973
He ’ ll give a renewal for two months, he says.	15.795627413466844
After he ’ ll see.	23.047437796574428
But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the Saturday pink.	18.33515272437565
And he wants it copied if it ’ s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_.	14.146709276321571
I can have access to it in the national library.	16.672516723142078
House of keys, don ’ t you see?	14.310039716682017
His name is Keyes.	19.7090057282652
It ’ s a play on the name.	18.755753340962205
But he practically promised he ’ d give the renewal.	11.660782562331141
But he wants just a little puff.	18.743228196723756
What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?	27.259206387098136
<URL>. — Will you tell him he can kiss my arse?	18.86393566095915
Myles Crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis.	12.481941828788491
Tell him that straight from the stable.	22.920830306568043
Look out for squalls.	19.611393029606027
All off for a drink.	20.63186768564841
Arm in arm.	17.95745186734053
Lenehan ’ s yachting cap on the cadge beyond.	20.22571932371915
Usual blarney.	21.577706852610767
Has a good pair of boots on him today.	23.205414030248704
Last time I saw him he had his heels on view.	20.538789069548393
Been walking in muck somewhere.	11.941038412841426
What was he doing in Irishtown?	15.550184504797292
— Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I suppose it ’ s worth a short par.	16.49871862635789
He ’ d give the ad, I think.	14.428862459814637
I ’ ll tell him...	11.560338637169595
<URL>. — He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his shoulder.	10.902575963267399
Any time he likes, tell him.	16.945748476613797
RAISING THE WIND — _Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin.	11.481319863533423
I ’ m up to here.	16.128302060230975
I ’ ve been through the hoop myself.	12.856056260819706
I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week.	17.83742078719457
Sorry, Jack.	20.75806473740489
You must take the will for the deed.	23.67285785815514
With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind anyhow.	20.653266681006983
J.	9.525932994442917
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently.	15.41765032492787
They caught up on the others and walked abreast.	19.494232661636183
— When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings.	14.250791687479651
— Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford.	16.350654720551177
Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson ’ s pillar.	15.057193322650015
SOME COLUMN! — THAT ’ S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID — That ’ s new, Myles Crawford said.	8.843856953816031
That ’ s copy.	18.74644188145669
Out for the waxies ’ Dargle.	17.326244104564296
Two old trickies, what?	13.566894682800815
— But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.	15.39219937751343
They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines ’ blue dome, Adam and Eve ’ s, saint Laurence O ’ Toole ’ s.	8.119558497761172
THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES — Easy all, Myles Crawford said.	6.921408489351889
No poetic licence.	15.134171096965462
We ’ re in the archdiocese here.	17.26695482096584
— And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer.	14.755573478373831
— Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried.	11.678466401609459
I like that.	18.120245226333175
I see the idea.	20.948617099424915
I see what you mean.	25.076528317652603
DAMES DONATE DUBLIN ’ S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF — It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak.	10.564562028842538
They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.	12.372297828333016
He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close.	15.422007130160223
Lenehan and Mr O ’ Madden Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney ’ s.	10.559129580182454
— Finished?	20.282520284002942
Myles Crawford said.	10.256759566061492
So long as they do no worse.	19.040605397517236
SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS.	12.01962573241864
— You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist.	15.030265297499247
It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself.	12.142594932586919
He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman.	23.77998369106494
And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.	12.303035619520793
Poor Penelope.	22.610527638691252
Penelope Rich.	27.809369591782076
They made ready to cross O ’ Connell street.	13.411861482613897
Hackney cars, cabs, delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn, rapidly.	4.737445231803963
WHAT? — AND LIKEWISE — WHERE?	7.903777964765759
— But what do you call it?	15.690851628521212
Myles Crawford asked.	16.98980604765439
Where did they get the plums?	22.257599872929973
VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE.	10.18674679614022
SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.	7.37091552595853
— Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to reflect.	17.020932013816562
Call it, let me see.	21.998062776957408
Call it: _deus nobis hæc otia <URL> — No, Stephen said.	9.584160627722829
I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of The <URL> — I see, the professor said.	9.389244623921343
He laughed richly.	16.437954341258916
— I see, he said again with new pleasure.	16.734477512564734
We gave him that idea, he added to J.	19.006627188657347
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy.	13.657802444923718
HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY J.	4.956233508367579
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held his peace.	10.356046249009777
— I see, the professor said.	14.512490870405454
He halted on sir John Gray ’ s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson through the meshes of his wry smile.	10.65639906361802
DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS.	4.776046565194154
— Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly.	13.323251524505821
That tickles me, I must say.	21.97719007511628
— Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty ’ s truth was known.	16.37547024236287
Pineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch.	9.506423968524656

Bloo...	19.77967057339287
Me?	29.37855752182649
No. Blood of the Lamb.	19.397057444070107
His slow feet walked him riverward, reading.	9.27276145297798
Are you saved?	20.598438394221382
All are washed in the blood of the lamb.	21.38719073019696

I could see the bluey silver over it.	11.937740375100077
Night I went down to the pantry in the kitchen.	29.074214738913657
Don ’ t like all the smells in it waiting to rush out.	16.414879198083003
What was it she wanted?	24.840570793066995

Very good for the brain.	30.232094209524462
From Butler ’ s monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor ’ s walk.	12.358306143691918

Undermines the constitution.	15.755499533858867
As he set foot on O ’ Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from the parapet.	11.110801111494238
Brewery barge with export stout.	9.422511743090848

Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see the brewery.	14.513910226919915
Regular world in itself.	18.262141597775667
Vats of porter wonderful.	17.370208661980527
Rats get in too.	20.840375086422295
Drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating.	11.527251137235917
Dead drunk on the porter.	28.037730332570316
Drink till they puke again like christians.	11.688619137657772
Imagine drinking that! Rats: vats.	10.217613531623329
Well, of course, if we knew all the things.	20.4586470273277
Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt quaywalls, gulls.	8.420270512997394
Rough weather outside.	16.92245478295481
If I threw myself down?	15.781412131221606
Reuben J ’ s son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage.	19.08087236664765
One and eightpence too much.	10.908037712412344
Hhhhm.	44.876532221709276
It ’ s the droll way he comes out with the things.	16.92888140313567
Knows how to tell a story too.	20.697384202717597
They wheeled lower.	15.547253383208153
Looking for grub.	15.791123047142285
Wait.	16.144754643793675
He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball.	12.334743581989828
Elijah thirtytwo feet per sec is com.	8.602519098808397
Not a bit.	19.389294695460613
The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of swells, floated under by the bridgepiers.	12.193111537396613
Not such damn fools.	13.523796369054663
Also the day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin ’ s King picked it up in the wake fifty yards astern.	14.999631279886348
Live by their wits.	17.57017154849904
They wheeled, flapping.	13.076464097632714
The hungry famished gull Flaps o ’ er the waters dull.	7.234682237684447
That is how poets write, the similar sounds.	15.285657120950123
But then Shakespeare has no rhymes: blank verse.	9.57888965541532
The flow of the language it is.	25.714418391204347
The thoughts.	22.99275626788011
Solemn.	44.25662045647404
Hamlet, I am thy father ’ s spirit Doomed for a certain time to walk the earth.	17.89717913696732
— Two apples a penny! Two for a penny! His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand.	13.307364069297957
Australians they must be this time of year.	16.740484062313
Shiny peels: polishes them up with a rag or a handkerchief.	15.372795610882722
Wait.	16.144754643793675
Those poor birds.	16.652054176608306
He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the Liffey.	11.038281388125803
See that?	24.707140477376203
The gulls swooped silently, two, then all from their heights, pouncing on prey.	11.354752372353387

O rocks! Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice.	17.62153513992561
She ’ s right after all.	16.490353573979586
Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.	15.37365164072053
She ’ s not exactly witty.	16.06830853840368
Can be rude too.	13.290047065999945
Blurt out what I was thinking.	21.765523271607417
Still, I don ’ t know.	14.294995275505478
She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice.	17.09179975131064
He has legs like barrels and you ’ d think he was singing into a barrel.	16.50267200126744
Now, isn ’ t that wit.	15.040542493830824
They used to call him big Ben.	18.17779001967425
Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone.	8.405950844289313

Our staple food.	15.939474631416548
Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street.	14.656054784372968

I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper.	9.097466526064412
I bet that would have caught on.	17.77090508617546
Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once.	12.23117393180662
Everyone dying to know what she ’ s writing.	23.59239252184153
Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing.	15.240096189425964

Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman.	17.78422147518243
I disturbed her at her devotions that morning.	13.638020497689801
But glad to communicate with the outside world.	16.828299657899894
Our great day, she said.	17.377427167522033

Sweet name too: caramel.	16.51865588368453

If she had married she would have changed.	20.58500387077172
I suppose they really were short of money.	11.980672379250906

Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.	19.231637526812374
— Go away! Isn ’ t that grand for her?	13.369843662472876

I hope it wasn ’ t any near relation.	12.23490837186064
May as well get her sympathy.	16.751153293154513

Hasn ’ t lost them anyhow.	17.285244904504616

He ’ s always bad then.	12.891048801977869
Do you know what he did last night?	17.105630558009704
Her hand ceased to rummage.	13.20813823401858
Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.	11.820959344136874
— What?	11.778589598318154
Mr Bloom asked.	11.735074165646148
Let her speak.	17.61166123960467
Look straight in her eyes.	18.197462305436755
I believe you.	21.14159364963936
Trust me.	23.62421552584227
— Woke me up in the night, she said.	17.000156790192257
Dream he had, a nightmare.	34.49810834837443
Indiges.	44.876532221709276
— Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.	10.091436651912831
— The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.	8.914195158717396
She took a folded postcard from her handbag.	16.41008750439365
— Read that, she said.	17.086719929939353
He got it this morning.	17.094089320471454

Mr Bloom asked, taking the card.	17.69980175822694
U.	20.136332872350966
P.?	24.011846969274192
— U.	20.313107031172763
p: up, she said.	15.092742653006377
Someone taking a rise out of him.	16.568407171345225
It ’ s a great shame for them whoever he is.	14.908907751764458
— Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.	13.517272651449009
She took back the card, sighing.	16.01980231543441
— And now he ’ s going round to Mr Menton ’ s office.	18.933202598325906
He ’ s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.	14.596800012233656
She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.	11.536574735787749
Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching.	16.54306303453404
Seen its best days.	13.474360932455188
Wispish hair over her ears.	18.340032657473046
And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to take the harm out of it.	8.84591177694954
Shabby genteel.	19.698768402221454
She used to be a tasty dresser.	15.357293913212352
Lines round her mouth.	20.98332456479962
Only a year or so older than Molly.	13.7743419793358
See the eye that woman gave her, passing.	20.187407047240452
Cruel.	37.15636826260063
The unfair sex.	13.894364366639804
He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.	14.627457072299283
Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny.	9.218639877035029
I ’ m hungry too.	10.859649079528577
Flakes of pastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek.	12.622711418167183
Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior.	7.6113501665151615

— Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy?	16.36161487905499
Mr Bloom asked.	11.735074165646148
— Mina Purefoy?	21.44417771525606
she said.	12.925446897228667
Philip Beaufoy I was thinking.	22.64829217073045
Playgoers ’ Club.	17.343233143304673
Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke.	21.639553677888017
Did I pull the chain?	14.931721431054033
Yes.	14.82237916275066
The last act.	17.409030442387124
— Yes.	10.060020338761374
— I just called to ask on the way in is she over it.	18.737726920867882
She ’ s in the lying - in hospital in Holles street.	12.981911546407476
Dr Horne got her in.	16.501508608609864
She ’ s three days bad now.	13.449028429394566
— O, Mr Bloom said.	9.929121419344971
I ’ m sorry to hear that.	11.022227146339647
— Yes, Mrs Breen said.	12.00897991401099
And a houseful of kids at home.	8.440209848224079
It ’ s a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.	17.13230272397042
— O, Mr Bloom said.	9.929121419344971
His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news.	7.8829790842393495
His tongue clacked in compassion.	11.047722689720693
Dth! Dth! — I ’ m sorry to hear that, he said.	13.066457238256318
Poor thing! Three days! That ’ s terrible for her.	15.048808430616097
Mrs Breen nodded.	19.409234185660313
— She was taken bad on the Tuesday...	16.7032001778156
Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her: — Mind! Let this man pass.	9.949045044259949
A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass.	13.872515060458488
Tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head.	12.941305810854457
— Watch him, Mr Bloom said.	12.854302127672677
He always walks outside the lampposts.	12.171288928713837
Watch! — Who is he if it ’ s a fair question?	24.0678814171044
Mrs Breen asked.	19.0391788311257
Is he dotty?	17.56358796994554
— His name is Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr Bloom said smiling.	9.428184636481264
Watch! — He has enough of them, she said.	21.252117940491697
Denis will be like that one of these days.	27.117431351350618
She broke off suddenly.	16.99916467356662
— There he is, she said.	12.74747312595422
I must go after him.	17.963481778613193
Goodbye.	43.770624527723555
Remember me to Molly, won ’ t you?	18.015492251257626
— I will, Mr Bloom said.	11.614769623378981
He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts.	10.105396225547663
Denis Breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison ’ s hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs.	10.78260327094697
Blown in from the bay.	23.28921425038446
Like old times.	17.573484330386318
He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.	11.253640237021955
Meshuggah.	49.9750299142878
Off his chump.	15.27985087859416
Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat.	13.465963163232567
Going the two days.	24.62450554023853
Watch him! Out he goes again.	17.913085744048896
One way of getting on in the world.	21.49096813774049

_It grew bigger and bigger and bigger_.	10.143590798803784
— Getting it up?	19.3847609213538
he said.	10.465399985534118
Well, it ’ s like a company idea, you see.	17.823840852961283
Part shares and part profits.	9.115497230299336
— Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket to scratch his groin.	13.208541703165688
Who is this was telling me?	18.321874616624086
Isn ’ t Blazes Boylan mixed up in it?	20.78297445079021
A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom ’ s heart.	10.272018110319053
He raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock.	14.445414228590813
Two.	28.11431108355381
Pub clock five minutes fast.	12.86349691638476

Hands moving.	25.288474406637892

His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly, longingly.	7.563462567291284
Wine.	37.50114057555287
He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to speed it, set his wineglass delicately down.	10.02068656195245
— Yes, he said.	8.850452724988298
No fear: no brains.	15.052857293816622
Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched.	12.163273069519397
Flea having a good square meal.	19.41561835601735
— He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello barracks.	12.523376334147846
By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he was telling me...	17.342488753046386
Hope that dewdrop doesn ’ t come down into his glass.	14.402993988968893
No, snuffled it up.	12.544274782213073

Sucking duck eggs by God till further orders.	10.858462073841297
Keep him off the boose, see?	18.424071691118403
O, by God, Blazes is a hairy chap.	18.899768951236485
Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves, cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin.	12.460774488621524
Herring ’ s blush.	37.6584288816821
Whose smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete.	8.38219582235322
Too much fat on the parsnips.	20.502181689291664
— And here ’ s himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said.	14.144298098840828
Can you give us a good one for the Gold cup?	22.24046084308097
— I ’ m off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered.	13.091918096333155
I never put anything on a horse.	21.682446931887043
Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese.	8.989803342181927
Sips of his wine soothed his palate.	15.952085868584518
Not logwood that.	14.712343332807896
Tastes fuller this weather with the chill off.	13.574855864515676
Nice quiet bar.	17.325347382276327
Nice piece of wood in that counter.	20.17971375993474
Nicely planed.	19.698768402221454
Like the way it curves there.	17.062644609216605
— I wouldn ’ t do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said.	12.84321423583445
It ruined many a man, the same horses.	23.148157800778076

I could have got seven to one against Saint Amant a fortnight before.	9.53416943459086
— That so?	13.53697205495797
Davy Byrne said...	11.760896329607169
He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned its pages.	15.560914830297332
— I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	12.856366789534045

Ay. He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the flutes.	16.609786251172256
— Ay, he said, sighing.	16.327582034550506
Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh.	14.149487718112733
Will I tell him that horse Lenehan?	20.364188213134266
He knows already.	17.11175120694375
Better let him forget.	24.660264367649262

Green by Drumleck.	15.964548519008074
Yellowgreen towards Sutton.	15.792367488319453
Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities.	10.817959756835002
Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you ’ ll toss me all.	16.34011418509761
O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away.	11.368480149141407

Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman ’ s breasts full in her blouse of nun ’ s veiling, fat nipples upright.	15.493093451817078
Hot I tongued her.	12.116126640402545

Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do.	22.38882944045779
A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.	13.00508770007448
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book: — What is this he is?	19.41005430645201
Isn ’ t he in the insurance line?	22.803315419648015
— He ’ s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said.	13.973729821927648
He does canvassing for the <URL> — I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said.	16.811751006553315
Is he in trouble?	20.003110638907486
— Trouble?	22.290936975209764
Nosey Flynn said.	9.956882661233214
Not that I heard of.	23.89629002847156
Why?	18.457368458488407
— Was he?	17.102544199680683
Nosey Flynn said.	9.956882661233214
So he was, faith.	18.242875623487304
I asked him how was all at home.	16.814482397414384
You ’ re right, by God.	18.7596319217833
So he was.	19.72278951375784
— I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way.	13.165571940423694
It only brings it up fresh in their minds.	17.363516713312116
— It ’ s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.	11.191506347830513
I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan ’ s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half.	17.070586102854346
She ’ s well nourished, I tell you.	14.474557581154329
Plovers on toast.	16.500578518635358
— And is he doing for the _Freeman? _ Davy Byrne said.	15.347783356624957
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.	10.75555183258086
You can make bacon of that.	14.489624668544796
— How so?	16.501117021679537
Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.	20.535799102832474
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers.	11.787788931318378
He winked.	23.46897060186244
— He ’ s in the craft, he said.	13.289568744411534
— Do you tell me so?	18.311135777307225
Davy Byrne said.	11.02748911430849
— Very much so, Nosey Flynn said.	9.435008846171772
Ancient free and accepted order.	14.41406751399049
He ’ s an excellent brother.	12.167657494711566
Light, life and love, by God.	21.031487567560223
They give him a leg up.	18.618506465151096
I was told that by a — well, I won ’ t say who.	19.779565802249763
— Is that a fact?	12.259471496257484
— O, it ’ s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said.	12.051372943934398
They stick to you when you ’ re down.	17.734258737493903
But they ’ re as close as damn it.	12.464827036946186
By God they did right to keep the women out of it.	17.83883516486767
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one: — Iiiiiichaaaaaaach! — There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing.	18.658408121960296
But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason.	14.112933532271068
That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.	14.299461703530001
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes: — And is that a fact?	13.581311685372569
Decent quiet man he is.	16.61525130142255
I often saw him in here and I never once saw him — you know, over the line.	23.81074967197348
— God Almighty couldn ’ t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.	11.530620162108514
Slips off when the fun gets too hot.	15.813962344081432
Didn ’ t you see him look at his watch?	21.960288994290952
Ah, you weren ’ t there.	22.008045444615647
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe.	21.014939785663966
Declare to God he does.	18.338843788513064
— There are some like that, Davy Byrne said.	11.572018047261762
— He ’ s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.	12.093003301884217
He ’ s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow.	13.648907310810278
Give the devil his due.	14.957697248640935
O, Bloom has his good points.	20.74198578819784
But there ’ s one thing he ’ ll never do.	21.3991119640167
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.	8.6524227835077
— I know, Davy Byrne said.	9.91456998415372
— Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.	11.190539947119834
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in.	12.266623642811231
Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.	15.451424593585116
— Day, Mr Byrne.	22.957731083395043
— Day, gentlemen.	14.830886345082137
They paused at the counter.	19.87633076838219
— Who ’ s standing?	19.61657850581199
Paddy Leonard asked.	14.620072697116175
— I ’ m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.	9.546651125333065
— Well, what ’ ll it be?	20.630074441178017
Paddy Leonard asked.	14.620072697116175
— I ’ ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.	10.008473026133178
— How much?	15.989117117789405
Paddy Leonard cried.	17.151358140797953
Since when, for God ’ sake?	26.81633054901031
What ’ s yours, Tom?	19.518911340856004
— How is the main drainage?	16.843514894663258
Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.	17.173400403206315
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.	12.173570413883766
— Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne?	19.73755766264538
he said.	10.465399985534118
— Certainly, sir.	11.02859168345434
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.	10.66928357833607
— Lord love a duck, he said.	10.906761416755982
Look at what I ’ m standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.	10.27293639236176
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup.	15.199028423341314
A dead snip.	14.90432609716354
— Zinfandel is it?	14.665302771418585
Nosey Flynn asked.	15.478627142109318
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.	13.310680614542942
— That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.	13.161994005642823
— Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.	10.168747437511227
Tom Rochford nodded and drank.	14.692404891743896
— Is it Zinfandel?	13.9355109665585
— Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked.	10.17239787381239
I ’ m going to plunge five bob on my own.	11.421641437677863
— Tell us if you ’ re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said.	12.236879727439643
Who gave it to you?	24.119033030325486
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.	13.894323310275
— So long! Nosey Flynn said.	8.933560586525923
The others turned.	18.487636807280197
— Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn.	11.677409640602859
Mr Byrne, sir, we ’ ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a...	17.74789013907389
— Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.	9.531277030041846
— Ay, Paddy Leonard said.	9.850836942059184
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth.	14.544981348691634
Something green it would have to be: spinach, say.	15.658888580261744
Then with those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.	11.096808566928038
At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest.	9.50516096789042
Surfeit.	44.876532221709276
Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents.	7.59426245156037
First sweet then savoury.	13.623254160301386
Mr Bloom coasted warily.	12.595839940050185
Ruminants.	44.876532221709276
Their upper jaw they move.	11.459724905210491
Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his?	16.918964603741628
Wasting time explaining it to Flynn ’ s mouth.	19.269565878922332
Lean people long mouths.	13.011050455364797
Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free.	15.424851130503992
Course then you ’ d have all the cranks pestering.	18.44518572330369
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars: Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M ’ invitasti.	10.143243851964344
Feel better.	22.787204635667955
Burgundy.	43.67326148961827
Good pick me up.	17.02431495044352
Who distilled first?	15.638046567258172
Some chap in the blues.	26.58306046506544
Dutch courage.	24.999911380567298
That _Kilkenny People_ in the national library now I must.	16.31028036579687
Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts.	12.004210043658365
They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes.	10.42222437153785
But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show.	15.659320357552092
— _A cenar <URL> What does that _teco_ mean?	9.844030233635527
Tonight perhaps.	22.326135201870652
Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited To come to supper tonight, The rum the rumdum.	9.972125828067792
Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to.	18.237812019769706
That ’ ll be two pounds ten about two pounds eight.	10.612287641304704
Three Hynes owes me.	12.795055479258181
Two eleven.	24.276319827719917
Prescott ’ s dyeworks van over there.	17.99401699076259
If I get Billy Prescott ’ s ad: two fifteen.	14.651298626465373
Five guineas about.	17.014404869931035
On the pig ’ s back.	17.696455591986485
Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.	15.012961089078857
Today.	33.733869721302284
Not think.	24.391954635814713
Tour the south then.	18.8076055262919
What about English wateringplaces?	12.728113330640292
Brighton, Margate.	19.734865374772
Piers by moonlight.	18.678019011166903
Her voice floating out.	14.651756619122438
Those lovely seaside girls.	11.167222137910704
Against John Long ’ s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle.	7.732811675915163
Handy man wants job.	14.110316976022549
Small wages.	19.698747466654336
Will eat anything.	18.063006473800193
Mr Bloom turned at Gray ’ s confectioner ’ s window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan ’ s bookstore.	13.021681908784613
_Why I left the church of Rome?	17.421814963699138
Birds ’ <URL> Women run him.	12.358355691690742
They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.	15.49628871839013
Same bait.	21.97136031001801
No tram in sight.	16.075258458754764
Wants to cross.	19.479840188974098
— Do you want to cross?	14.35287482686103
Mr Bloom asked.	11.735074165646148
The blind stripling did not answer.	15.311585614996131
His wallface frowned weakly.	10.236164345822282
He moved his head uncertainly.	20.972351442341473
— You ’ re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said.	10.6489597611246
Molesworth street is opposite.	14.423140559619082
Do you want to cross?	16.819078257066394
There ’ s nothing in the way.	21.758057536067742
The cane moved out trembling to the left.	14.22373631385596
Mr Bloom ’ s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks ’ van drawn up before Drago ’ s.	9.720290476556753
Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was.	13.68370121931015
Horse drooping.	25.63672198434905
Driver in John Long ’ s.	13.687001936489812
Slaking his drouth.	17.29158572821
— There ’ s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it ’ s not moving.	16.083372006088414
I ’ ll see you across.	13.506283866421432
— Yes, the stripling answered.	15.309758828946734
South Frederick street.	18.03092383071145
— Come, Mr Bloom said.	11.2076816486056
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.	11.350645809045012
Say something to him.	23.109741814480998
Better not do the condescending.	16.54528355611165
They mistrust what you tell them.	17.537802995092566
Pass a common remark.	13.238819299074418
— The rain kept off.	11.695143748632203
No answer.	21.891076865626466
Stains on his coat.	28.295147030481864
Slobbers his food, I suppose.	18.811880474663887
Tastes all different for him.	13.02872336369761
Have to be spoonfed first.	20.749229999856592
Like a child ’ s hand, his hand.	23.611046350480326
Like Milly ’ s was.	21.011569487657606
Sensitive.	44.25662045647404
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.	15.123756341064901
Wonder if he has a name.	23.482702464420843
Van.	44.25662045647404
Keep his cane clear of the horse ’ s legs: tired drudge get his doze.	13.848651778237372
That ’ s right.	13.33396386920888
Behind a bull: in front of a horse.	20.437386503164298
— Thanks, sir.	14.096548111287241
Knows I ’ m a man.	19.784938431716615
Voice.	44.876532221709276
— Right now?	16.77404148197636
First turn to the left.	25.93861963614052
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.	13.94590968237251
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed.	11.688969826608028
Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?	16.99935597817387
Must have felt it.	17.26425147849442
See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume.	16.452167423866268
Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.	17.382513305553843
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed.	17.41815270846083
Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.	18.596857042380055
Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn ’ t that cane?	17.303134157335016
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.	20.5375489555919
Penrose! That was that chap ’ s name.	25.21079326744188
Look at all the things they can learn to do.	20.55443377710742
Read with their fingers.	24.048712950153753
Tune pianos.	21.577729785062214
Or we are surprised they have any brains.	18.017910506177465
Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.	11.203245764821709
Of course the other senses are more.	17.178186910945303
Embroider.	44.876532221709276
Plait baskets.	21.577729785062214
People ought to help.	27.651482228613958
Workbasket I could buy for Molly ’ s birthday.	20.54648920292975
Hates sewing.	19.698768402221454
Might take an objection.	14.794830734199802
Dark men they call them.	15.855685372715687
Sense of smell must be stronger too.	11.836246050153614
Smells on all sides, bunched together.	11.468056481682554
Then the spring, the summer: smells.	19.163295638991368
Tastes?	44.624031918175795
They say you can ’ t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head.	17.14295449453932
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.	18.26410784363738
And with a woman, for instance.	23.732949860596307
More shameless not seeing.	14.056646603384559
That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air.	12.912768689322297
Look at me.	19.169099655033932
I have them all on.	22.45316030281561
Must be strange not to see her.	18.419553993921518
Kind of a form in his mind ’ s eye.	27.751845011788102
The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves.	18.248599813704153
His hands on her hair, for instance.	23.659742402799754
Say it was black, for instance.	26.046416774692183
Good.	25.782918879857334
We call it black.	23.003197883136597
Then passing over her white skin.	16.48236082284697
Different feel perhaps.	16.21248065830876
Feeling of white.	24.22209002250599
Postoffice.	43.669601723859934
Fag today.	21.894413417555118
Send her a postal order two shillings, half a crown.	12.534450230987883
Accept my little present.	15.41647927917996
Stationer ’ s just here too.	22.93908941978461
Wait.	16.144754643793675
Think over it.	18.921223209221647
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears.	10.734789416297918
Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek.	17.919647914691794
Downy hair there too.	16.106397366565588
Not smooth enough.	16.977377739725473
The belly is the smoothest.	23.53060980566003
No - one about.	16.597018092528796
There he goes into Frederick street.	11.400016530502134
Perhaps to Levenston ’ s dancing academy piano.	13.607254371708244
Might be settling my braces.	10.307624800493619
Walking by Doran ’ s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly.	15.420976872214109
But I know it ’ s whitey yellow.	20.85319142393551
Want to try in the dark to see.	22.18709931985873
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.	13.791307837647947
Poor fellow! Quite a boy.	14.710612689767714
Terrible.	45.74910187899788
What dreams would he have, not seeing?	21.559325932492246
Life a dream for him.	15.094458540714847
Where is the justice being born that way?	17.17561688361772
All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York.	7.010125970254954
Holocaust.	44.876532221709276
Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.	10.124563925147063
Dear, dear, dear.	19.386731713760764
Pity, of course: but somehow you can ’ t cotton on to them someway.	18.12425484902282
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons ’ hall.	12.000669683011674
Solemn as Troy.	16.331607152208186
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace.	11.001138135282433
Old legal cronies cracking a magnum.	8.876563073930042
Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school.	16.71206874580356
I sentenced him to ten years.	17.201537567317242
I suppose he ’ d turn up his nose at that stuff I drank.	17.298696648012868
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle.	20.69885436243583
Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder ’ s court.	23.841028606806947
Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime.	6.437133641020201
Sends them to the rightabout.	27.94644150409497
The devil on moneylenders.	12.078429245735538
Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling.	16.43732034575752
Now he ’ s really what they call a dirty jew.	16.928973056787385

No use sticking to him like a leech.	19.661664387568653
Wear out my welcome.	13.121895762705622
Sure to know someone on the gate.	25.577756832144292
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street.	14.948725179209497
First I must.	24.23857047771253

He swerved to the right.	20.426426476692725
Is it?	24.293989426525417
Almost certain.	26.104763871459824
Wine in my face.	26.793509995768783
Why did I?	20.559486190109975
Too heady.	20.024822024424243
Yes, it is.	15.404257934742308
The walk.	23.61333636470821
Not see.	24.06700299946348
Get on.	24.787967131675178
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.	13.893527516655379
Handsome building.	23.2946109852925
Sir Thomas Deane designed.	11.19245657674062
Not following me?	21.345707278444806
Didn ’ t see me perhaps.	15.77705819925951
Light in his eyes.	24.084674580871233
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs.	15.691392408113396
Quick.	32.35443626726641
Cold statues: quiet there.	13.298895878375173
Safe in a minute.	26.422536140933264
No. Didn ’ t see me.	13.754837773870534
After two.	25.438444124611568
Just at the gate.	28.194021894426054
My heart! His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone.	9.170040835471598
Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.	15.159719038778475
Look for something I.	21.02013963311862
Where did I?	22.018967866843575
Busy looking.	24.486406866335837
He thrust back quick Agendath.	11.671518303916292
Afternoon she said.	16.41472755815052
I am looking for that.	18.897773553867896
Yes, that.	18.734516089161026
Try all pockets.	16.933539157685132
Handker.	44.876532221709276

Walk quietly.	24.067808072226573
Moment more.	24.12328040865078
My heart.	21.942156059366837
His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap lotion have to call tepid paper stuck.	15.019390706815944
Ah soap there I yes.	15.269276156344505
Gate.	51.98932121274747
Safe! Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred: — And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.	14.088109323445845
A great poet on a great brother poet.	17.721511244396964
A hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.	8.103173276712917
He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.	11.327166510953841
A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck.	12.042128287331764
— Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering.	13.713825311763852
The beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts.	7.414481255071686
One always feels that Goethe ’ s judgments are so true.	12.88983954250281
True in the larger analysis.	27.605998657016464
Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off.	9.610004926628969
Bald, most zealous by the door he gave his large ear all to the attendant ’ s words: heard them: and was gone.	19.44928586878078
Two left.	25.64785608627411

Folly.	44.25662045647404
Persist.	44.876532221709276
— Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare ’ s Hamlet though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.	11.85616083549746
— All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his shadow.	9.961223575789889
I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.	9.128243880964217

Art has to reveal to us ideas, formless spiritual essences.	8.6859396120016
The supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring.	13.54827637432481
The painting of Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas.	9.525470872224783
The deepest poetry of Shelley, the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal wisdom, Plato ’ s world of ideas.	11.632847211385295

Wall, tarnation strike me! — The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.	13.79078781768441
Aristotle was once Plato ’ s schoolboy.	20.661989762198445
— And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said.	12.223206775131363
One can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.	19.00932753481854
He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.	16.171376949100473
Formless spiritual.	23.29473476946619

Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light.	12.827789409781975
He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.	11.751523705182962
— That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet ’ s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato ’ s.	11.164826373862068
John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth: — Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.	10.200144747363252
— Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?	23.53231387570622
Unsheathe your dagger definitions.	11.22381458675551
Horseness is the whatness of allhorse.	15.98639917050168
Streams of tendency and eons they worship.	8.348593998793513

Through spaces smaller than red globules of man ’ s blood they creepycrawl after Blake ’ s buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow.	9.600984085040436
Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.	28.39771452971749
Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.	11.394346548338222
— Haines is gone, he said.	13.242146763208705
— Is he?	16.140537525197093
— I was showing him Jubainville ’ s book.	16.42468724579101
He ’ s quite enthusiastic, don ’ t you know, about Hyde ’ s _Lovesongs of <URL> I couldn ’ t bring him in to hear the discussion.	13.721247969030559
He ’ s gone to Gill ’ s to buy it.	12.46688869060617
Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick To greet the callous public.	9.543281572845938
Writ, I ween, ’ twas not my wish In lean unlovely English.	10.286684159900654
— The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.	15.374615686045667
We feel in England.	14.437734405587719
Penitent thief.	22.959358561719682
Gone.	25.591004547417455
I smoked his baccy.	12.252923151397056
Green twinkling stone.	17.298029283736508
An emerald set in the ring of the sea.	22.764607987722083
— People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of Russell warned occultly.	10.454113670366526
The movements which work revolutions in the world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant ’ s heart on the hillside.	16.93286668003163
For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother.	16.640415748669472
France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer ’ s Phæacians.	14.064179045398024
From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.	11.614052480145297
— Mallarmé, don ’ t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris.	11.662337758691239
The one about <URL> He says: _il se promène, lisant au livre de lui - même_, don ’ t you know, _reading the book of himself_.	6.696199007454092
He describes _Hamlet_ given in a French town, don ’ t you know, a provincial town.	14.182370691494961
They advertised it.	15.505671191131114
His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.	8.904282441388348
_Hamlet ou Le Distrait Pièce de Shakespeare_ He repeated to John Eglinton ’ s newgathered frown: — _Pièce de Shakespeare_, don ’ t you know.	7.612748584367849
It ’ s so French.	14.850948178122973
The French point of view.	16.57643821655942
_Hamlet ou_...	13.709667123441927
— The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.	15.269863809648669
John Eglinton laughed.	18.67878906912669
— Yes, I suppose it would be, he said.	14.034624877394618
Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.	15.325711697341895
Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.	8.69593413492978
— A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said.	14.051917377078592
Not for nothing was he a butcher ’ s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms.	11.814017902513381
Nine lives are taken off for his father ’ s one.	18.496523572689906
Our Father who art in purgatory.	13.301239763524242
Khaki Hamlets don ’ t hesitate to shoot.	9.927725900543466

Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.	11.079329926139492
Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none But we had spared...	7.5321688828288424
Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp.	8.944549012360325
The devil and the deep sea.	23.865179530768575
— He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best ’ s behoof.	16.75071677634262
Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.	11.572991019743313
List! List! O List! My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.	10.152731115388708
If thou didst ever...	11.966798054531075
— What is a ghost?	18.704641494975807
Stephen said with tingling energy.	15.692630447557402
One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners.	11.100608801583771
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin.	7.773673611989491
Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_, returning to the world that has forgotten him?	12.10565769615607
Who is King Hamlet?	16.425024961137698
John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.	13.827319311880316
Lifted.	44.876532221709276
— It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a swift glance their hearing.	16.011932878379174
The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside.	20.659759216175907

Work in all you know.	23.70187697332301
Make them accomplices.	14.807277496281067
— Shakespeare has left the huguenot ’ s house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank.	14.325661812081366
But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes.	9.567672891287293
The swan of Avon has other thoughts.	8.104356874777
Composition of place.	19.143899572434318
A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice.	17.914549988323316
It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre.	19.680173502995906
He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name: Hamlet, I am thy father ’ s spirit, bidding him list.	13.124621718434641
To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.	16.80557121166168
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son ’ s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet ’ s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?	14.707134270521497
— But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.	18.168634225320517
Art thou there, truepenny?	18.310998150733937
— Interesting only to the parish clerk.	18.497715927745805
I mean, we have the plays.	19.33501300169595
I mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the poet lived?	15.711548706864827
As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l ’ Isle has said.	9.597266852886463
Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet ’ s drinking, the poet ’ s debts.	20.52279327691217
We have _King Lear_: and it is immortal.	19.62268508352019
Mr Best ’ s face, appealed to, agreed.	15.41964935786955
Flow over them with your waves and with your waters, Mananaan, Mananaan MacLir...	13.693371970755187
How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?	14.71897695309609
Marry, I wanted it.	28.320272515483687
Take thou this noble.	14.393629788918112

Well...	15.400303255052028
No. When, then?	19.253788175793048

John Eglinton ’ s carping voice asked.	15.658520157471317
Her ghost at least has been laid for ever.	13.990484748197666
She died, for literature at least, before she was born.	18.46501688722909
— She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born.	13.471272670109274
She saw him into and out of the world.	19.003944059239757
She took his first embraces.	20.751518702388307
She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.	17.607999159152012

— The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.	16.31663971043261
— Bosh! Stephen said rudely.	17.345152620686843
A man of genius makes no mistakes.	12.162116928762295
His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.	10.075666044442274
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.	8.935147026439923
— A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine.	11.063595209721921
What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?	7.617528470283885
— Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world.	20.876820172206656
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit nomen! _), Socratididion ’ s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know.	15.339389440852946
But neither the midwife ’ s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.	9.294725950734376

Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.	14.315866274450892
His look went from brooder ’ s beard to carper ’ s skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned.	10.811925809548564
— He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.	14.373173593723473
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling _The girl I left behind <URL> If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows.	11.686144497301093

Stephen sat down.	22.906228642834822
The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers.	14.885505789100698
Blushing, his mask said: — Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.	16.540110874139486
He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low: — Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?	16.931871545528892
Alarmed face asks me.	14.253526576901315
Why did he come?	18.600100816896607
Courtesy or an inward light?	16.570048124019184
— Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.	14.32936498016953
— Yes.	10.060020338761374
Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.	15.984627865467706
Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully tapsters ’ wives.	10.707064335734412

And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.	8.7591856306523
— Yes.	10.060020338761374
So you think...	18.463426516705308
The door closed behind the outgoer.	13.598555708316717

Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.	11.352298821089562

— Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic.	17.092708003245214
We know nothing but that he lived and suffered.	16.791089398600132
Not even so much.	19.192597516639687
Others abide our question.	12.81454855526821
A shadow hangs over all the rest.	16.774134392065864
— But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn ’ t it?	11.21415085993852
Mr Best pleaded.	16.298451245788115
I mean, a kind of private paper, don ’ t you know, of his private life.	17.26711889031193
I mean, I don ’ t care a button, don ’ t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...	12.56028148134833

Put beurla on it, littlejohn.	18.666080367368924
Quoth littlejohn Eglinton: — I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.	11.900514954299094
Bear with me.	20.146824111321855
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows.	5.3377620799043175
A basilisk.	22.408282809882227
_E quando vede l ’ uomo l ’ attosca_.	7.165387456607341
Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.	19.03341694405833
— As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image.	10.244589944917939
And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth.	16.86753506185651
In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be.	16.616238729567208
So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.	19.823827286654403
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.	10.987856656154815
— Yes, Mr Best said youngly.	11.307972490170698
I feel Hamlet quite young.	12.93301199791417
The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.	16.551398715344313
Has the wrong sow by the lug.	18.99681369861855
He is in my father.	27.350619836739604
— That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.	18.374947569867217
John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.	11.984321569381803
— If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market.	15.384878864626884
The plays of Shakespeare ’ s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.	10.249822121208632
— The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.	13.80845214327198
— There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.	14.627372162220198
Said that.	26.66738449222806
— If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, _ look to see when and how the shadow lifts.	12.087700799561885
What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?	8.92858332677293
Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.	7.885685094635613
— A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.	20.808790266285662
— The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected.	9.558009416682493
The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.	14.706578133477407
Good Bacon: gone musty.	10.305877035182025
Shakespeare Bacon ’ s wild oats.	21.73834688945916
Cypherjugglers going the highroads.	15.949893560700552

What town, good masters?	19.062950467859373
Mummed in names: A.	13.7139005141207
East of the sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n - og_.	14.583227890408033
Booted the twain and staved.	9.587094123208077
How many miles to Dublin?	15.515990292301435
Three score and ten, sir.	11.894139225813548
Will we be there by candlelight?	13.475674163050236
— Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.	17.800255962349464
— Does he?	20.16683880532974
What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?	11.447296358141733
— Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, that which was lost.	16.674919157573495
What was lost is given back to him: his daughter ’ s child.	21.55316095192321
_My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this <URL> Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?	10.513796319420909
— The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.	16.125020475813844
_L ’ art d ’ être grand_...	8.987285737668994
— Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?	18.338438632519622
Do you know what you are talking about?	17.96745134138913
Such an appeal will touch him.	11.869365159318889
The images of other males of his blood will repel him.	14.01049314217487
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.	10.981199393852446
— I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public.	18.462564501753626
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw.	11.697508357612692
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris.	10.00222140573911
His articles on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant.	10.600344196034245
Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets.	16.866757609901686
The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke.	7.5255642548868815
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk ’ s egg, prize of their fray.	12.816991623279414
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords.	10.00892395937715
Dost love, Miriam?	19.973537835910022
Dost love thy man?	14.110786551403322
— That may be too, Stephen said.	15.169640590383809
Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life.	16.947065497252627
Why does he send to one who is a _buonaroba, _ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him?	14.459243955664455
He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written _Romeo and Juliet_.	13.060794968070292
Why?	18.457368458488407
He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down.	12.012489564357189
Assumed dongiovannism will not save him.	13.034484610459174
No later undoing will undo the first undoing.	11.760015320720461
The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding.	11.365743400591755
If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman ’ s invisible weapon.	11.250498494396707
There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself.	19.98479818808482
A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.	13.796969524976518
And in the porches of their ears I pour.	18.325268212203895
— The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear.	16.533056370589055
But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come.	13.31743531691961
The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet ’ s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator.	11.98068624131131
He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.	18.79947965712284
But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed.	12.776652241338304
His beaver is up.	14.449173204500891
He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore ’ s rocks or what you will, the sea ’ s voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.	28.517776860125366
— Amen! was responded from the doorway.	14.278639815623697
Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?	17.972551203644418
_Entr ’ acte_.	14.700349745950076
A ribald face, sullen as a dean ’ s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles.	14.09765762696146
My telegram.	23.841481076341285
— You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not?	14.400847884015997
he asked of Stephen.	18.63550321204512
Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.	14.399680761575105
They make him welcome.	19.688669486395092
_Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch <URL> Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.	4.383614581964119
He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.	7.925159522240398
He lifts his hands.	16.073168454690435
Veils fall.	23.417692095215532
O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.	8.553953940619335
— Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said.	12.942163033319133
A most instructive discussion.	13.776643491109885
Mr Mulligan, I ’ ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare.	20.164158384888683
All sides of life should be represented.	20.17694679610138
He smiled on all sides equally.	16.211334989432974
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled: — Shakespeare?	18.0219864389721
he said.	10.465399985534118
I seem to know the name.	21.633588772331148
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.	12.405212306702499
— To be sure, he said, remembering brightly.	15.695681393030858
The chap that writes like Synge.	11.271777612439418
Mr Best turned to him.	17.452174820783963
— Haines missed you, he said.	12.11693113215631
Did you meet him?	18.424912033157117
He ’ ll see you after at the D.	20.320528330273337
B.	17.785236174055573
C.	14.373100099742409
He ’ s gone to Gill ’ s to buy Hyde ’ s _Lovesongs of Connacht_.	11.24373999022861
— I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said.	12.364401155684158
I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.	12.801283420559395
Vining held that the prince was a woman.	24.003724254950477
Has no - one made him out to be an Irishman?	22.96205816436619
Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues.	19.184567586271204
— The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde ’ s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook.	16.943874498577888
<URL> where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.	16.449421394813147
— For Willie Hughes, is it not?	17.079467806425026
the quaker librarian asked.	8.456281809671285
Or Hughie Wills?	13.095554370852845
Mr William Himself.	20.58658733536844
W.	26.96142366609788
H.: who am I?	19.368062108439716
— I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.	13.10004939800049
Of course it ’ s all paradox, don ’ t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it ’ s so typical the way he works it out.	11.98487981708796
It ’ s the very essence of Wilde, don ’ t you know.	10.104275289689124
The light touch.	16.756367342996864
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.	16.40335539616342
Tame essence of Wilde.	14.96253212997684
You ’ re darned witty.	11.618887940389952
Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy ’ s ducats.	9.536721032778178
How much did I spend?	19.57514716722202
O, a few shillings.	23.97909935660662
For a plump of pressmen.	11.456091250167809
Humour wet and dry.	16.158568586330517
Wit.	44.876532221709276
You would give your five wits for youth ’ s proud livery he pranks in.	9.963128543998355
Lineaments of gratified desire.	11.476736969353276
Take her for me.	22.031357005139455
In pairing time.	15.4264836308636
Jove, a cool ruttime send them.	20.625780010674678
Yea, turtledove her.	11.818161374706186
Eve.	50.378566370130095
Naked wheatbellied sin.	13.939531594496039
A snake coils her, fang in ’ s kiss.	15.66845570180608
— Do you think it is only a paradox?	16.07466879764884
the quaker librarian was asking.	8.746554289353003
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.	12.19437191061784
They talked seriously of mocker ’ s seriousness.	13.576199505503023
Buck Mulligan ’ s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile.	10.164498451827678
Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket.	17.748773649570616
His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.	12.509906936661839
— Telegram! he said.	12.582823577413688
Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull! He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully: — _The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing <URL> Signed: Dedalus.	10.095287377488665
Where did you launch it from?	17.402880794348988
The kips?	22.37386930341673
No. College Green.	15.01264881430335
Have you drunk the four quid?	13.744755182003917
Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street.	13.350385067319557
O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite! Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue: — It ’ s what I ’ m telling you, mister honey, it ’ s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in.	13.214126079130518
’ Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I ’ m thinking, and he limp with leching.	9.944261719727793
And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery ’ s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.	10.582195553811012
He wailed: — And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.	14.62630124877199
Stephen laughed.	26.25163505494403
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.	12.669155810753088
— The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you.	13.280907933017891
He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule.	11.979033963591588
He ’ s out in pampooties to murder you.	10.507777519199507
— Me! Stephen exclaimed.	13.89699289967103
That was your contribution to literature.	11.158364963481217
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.	17.018206063172673
— Murder you! he laughed.	19.579844447992233
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint - André - des - Arts.	5.839066799348989

I met a fool i ’ the forest.	12.494329752038265
— Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.	16.069762635520643
—...	8.070682464843227
in which everyone can find his own.	13.433761506735424
So Mr Justice Madden in his _Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms...	9.355516520587601
Yes?	31.42736445295056
What is it?	12.175206074269104
— There ’ s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card.	18.2427190993211
From the <URL> He wants to see the files of the _Kilkenny People_ for last year.	17.40112173171979
— Certainly, certainly, certainly.	12.142462498898041
Is the gentleman?...	16.298061814753844
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked: — Is he?...	11.904211993042756
O, there! Brisk in a galliard he was off, out.	19.964082719786976
In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.	8.244278694123091
— This gentleman?	18.3741116623417
Kilkenny People? _ To be sure.	19.240836175649854
Good day, sir.	14.380659463243616
_Kilkenny_...	19.513536995961765
We have certainly...	15.045355938981997
A patient silhouette waited, listening.	10.164121256719453
— All the leading provincial...	12.168973605112907
_Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian, _ <NUM>...	7.856754028824204
Will you please?...	14.938510815212856
Evans, conduct this gentleman...	11.290521123512285
If you just follow the atten...	10.459347237498672
Or, please allow me...	14.013087767236557
This way...	20.11631015653977
Please, sir...	16.304386037140667
The door closed.	16.721668799375724
— The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.	10.677857210487797
He jumped up and snatched the card.	15.93614872738864
— What ’ s his name?	12.450007667987022
Bloom.	18.279381378412623
He rattled on: — Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more.	11.790840748462163
I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite.	15.367624199429233
The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer.	10.523188538789986
Every day we must do homage to her.	13.85039683184621
_Life of life, thy lips <URL> Suddenly he turned to Stephen: — He knows you.	17.369024955135036
He knows your old fellow.	12.165286888670908
O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks.	20.44013160692581
His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.	9.962782834407742
Venus Kallipyge.	22.27451478501541
O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the maiden hid_.	10.369695249996328
— We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best ’ s approval.	18.684246323437872
We begin to be interested in Mrs S.	17.52495426676113
Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.	22.059021658920482
— Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus ’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope.	8.89479192617427
Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland.	20.238947239045586
His life was rich.	18.42952969237294
His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit.	13.101051726921702
Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies.	5.373667299938993
Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays.	14.726578870338807
The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba.	7.60303334482206
Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.	7.157079856527908
You know Manningham ’ s story of the burgher ’ s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon ’ s blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_.	13.150408992740008
And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.	12.685314979341504
Cours la Reine.	15.593308209257264
_Encore vingt sous.	12.019620622697591
Minette?	44.75790071189311
Tu veux? _ — The height of fine society.	15.986382611697795
And sir William Davenant of Oxford ’ s mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.	12.828345171793789
Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed: — Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock! — And Harry of six wives ’ daughter.	10.554719902343496
And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings.	6.807306632130696
But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?	10.753834785053304
Do and do.	20.2783048579186
Thing done.	23.691867114069705
In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn.	8.60226607090249
An azured harebell like her veins.	10.269271693837519
Lids of Juno ’ s eyes, violets.	19.213554208657616
He walks.	24.248207420673783
One life is all.	18.73203415776963
One body.	20.545827598615112
Do. But do.	11.973019089698964
Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.	11.969652808101843
Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton ’ s desk sharply.	13.884366312220479
— Whom do you suspect?	17.79571197197021
he challenged.	20.716189822330634
— Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets.	21.063801047590406
Once spurned twice spurned.	13.025076670240374
But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.	18.356545096361952
Love that dare not speak its name.	10.208236626041806
— As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.	17.874914810726544
Old wall where sudden lizards flash.	9.153601009100099
— It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion.	16.8981524183045
Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife.	15.788934030831388
But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow.	14.615549479375302
Two deeds are rank in that ghost ’ s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband ’ s brother.	11.373682166232504
Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood.	31.695020516120465
Once a wooer, twice a wooer.	10.618025534549952
Stephen turned boldly in his chair.	19.627477651976456
— The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning.	18.025788308478777
If you deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him.	15.36561828115335
All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan ’ s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy ’ s words, wed her second, having killed her first.	14.154522546230234
O, yes, mention there is.	14.268951153538987
In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father ’ s shepherd.	13.676113958277963
Explain you then.	20.671017453163522
Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.	10.004363791024726
He faced their silence.	11.427196340413118
To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.	14.226950442641776
She was entitled to her widow ’ s dower At common law.	14.152722693915152
His legal knowledge was great Our judges tell us.	8.601881769798815
Him Satan fleers, Mocker: And therefore he left out her name From the first draft but he did not leave out The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters, For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford And in London.	12.382986813030056
<URL> Leftherhis Secondbest Leftherhis Bestabed Secabest Leftabed.	5.983575747773255
Woa! — Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.	11.094421248278628
— He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer.	16.479719782915428
Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?	15.38671292476209
— It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.	15.713505933094986
— _Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.	8.005043858424283
— Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.	5.835086038816171
Let me think.	20.61088600203895
— Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don ’ t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.	9.198434595906827
— Do you mean he died so?	13.3891052001559
Mr Best asked with slight concern.	12.257469363404399

Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen ’ s leech Lopez, his jew ’ s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting.	13.531869294006388

— Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions.	12.32820195354624
He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it.	11.516722397828527
Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage.	11.599092753160013
Accusations are made in anger.	15.50673079791238
The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel.	10.958692633472769
Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet.	7.634174488996303

Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to man.	16.099433428014994
It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten.	9.727276723058507

When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote _Hamlet_ he was not the father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.	18.64597622310849

Be acted on.	15.363736988552487
Lapwing.	30.82645828986655
I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau.	21.459988763854504
My kingdom for a drink.	20.730505316715853
On. — You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he took the stuff of his plays.	18.684802551131266
Why did he take them rather than others?	14.98970239048796
Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what ’ s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow.	14.009618854856912
Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered.	9.914513867139876
The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first.	11.587073915313281
Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare ’ s reverence, the angel of the world.	17.057505421290305
Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney ’ s _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?	11.608526091322606
— That was Will ’ s way, John Eglinton defended.	18.283310458143784
We should not now combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith.	8.978136240859277
_Que voulez - vous? _ Moore would say.	9.754696176885773
He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.	9.569937427696901
— Why?	18.250995805704118
Stephen answered himself.	22.785790049104083
Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him.	17.98389863282797
The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book.	7.090298901941902
It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.	10.836798910170641
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.	15.054543571463096
But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil.	11.481818846161076
The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth.	13.33032648368964
An original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.	10.931293390161263
It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid.	18.002220636996338
Age has not withered it.	14.600290922007826
Beauty and peace have not done it away.	13.361656810708384
It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_, twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet, _ in _Measure for Measure_ — and in all the other plays which I have not read.	12.481853411302893
He laughed to free his mind from his mind ’ s bondage.	19.946586031235704
Judge Eglinton summed up.	12.321377723756507
— The truth is midway, he affirmed.	14.794193126275205
He is the ghost and the prince.	25.875329339457522
He is all in all.	22.764735335360932
— He is, Stephen said.	14.74103629567699
The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.	16.000437059422513
All in all.	21.467523213197744
In _Cymbeline, _ in _Othello_ he is bawd and cuckold.	11.48428297034292
He acts and is acted on.	11.634981520409799
Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he kills the real Carmen.	12.358059882671947
His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.	9.545434718270709
— Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly.	7.283825103534303
O word of fear! Dark dome received, reverbed.	9.541240941681496
— And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.	9.1319938695048
When all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?) _ is right.	11.578345351756441
After God Shakespeare has created most.	12.66270809537655
— Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said.	8.614867950708952
He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth.	17.161214186680443
The motion is ended.	13.23417292572692
Gravediggers bury Hamlet _père_ and Hamlet <URL> A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music.	13.356649441250699
And, what though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced.	10.280163646875518
If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa ’ s lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go.	14.661373235500927
Strong curtain.	21.57747753479845
He found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible.	17.136547303250556
Maeterlinck says: _If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep.	11.165057791774005
If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will <URL> Every life is many days, day after day.	9.07512607268766
We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers - in - love, but always meeting ourselves.	9.680450015157302
The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.	12.809047181301638
_ — Eureka! _ Buck Mulligan cried.	16.72739931302484
_Eureka! _ Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton ’ s desk.	15.578878461177492
— May I?	20.975794462191978
he said.	10.465399985534118
The Lord has spoken to Malachi.	11.82886139017043
He began to scribble on a slip of paper.	13.50766785426453
Take some slips from the counter going out.	18.02233998192339
— Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall live.	14.825058074017196
The rest shall keep as they are.	13.12554224384823
He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.	11.36098850483393
Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his variorum edition of _The Taming of the <URL> — You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen.	9.175037824007841
You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle.	19.532790564523193
Do you believe your own theory?	16.624167243779937
— No, Stephen said promptly.	16.422848094778136
— Are you going to write it?	14.070979957662916
Mr Best asked.	15.807327805202362
You ought to make it a dialogue, don ’ t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.	11.851069863939236
John Eclecticon doubly smiled.	11.723358086647377
— Well, in that case, he said, I don ’ t see why you should expect payment for it since you don ’ t believe it yourself.	13.880673099830952
Dowden believes there is some mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more.	10.010728318663238
Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument.	13.547652277071299
It will come as a surprise to his grace.	24.6222010691321
But he believes his theory.	12.444658800764776
I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief.	14.386122775389456
That is, help me to believe or help me to unbelieve?	18.627110275587754
Who helps to believe?	18.413956916594262
<URL> Who to unbelieve?	15.913471450596177
Other chap.	22.342149049782474
— You are the only contributor to _Dana_ who asks for pieces of silver.	9.443232809398783
Fred Ryan wants space for an article on economics.	9.909384018143568
Fraidrine.	44.876532221709276
Two pieces of silver he lent me.	12.024715109076869
Tide you over.	17.38169697762812
Economics.	44.876532221709276
— For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.	13.726187027147827
Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice: — I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.	13.481152625834973
He broke away.	17.157730092415083
— Come, Kinch.	12.670644819878584
Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.	19.307301280666103
Come, Kinch.	16.41859312420788
You have eaten all we left.	11.765138609361363
Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.	10.665853341428166
Stephen rose.	26.471875806926963
Life is many days.	14.56722914333197
This will end.	17.333785772941464
— We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said.	12.077611741919808
_Notre ami_ Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.	11.741101582035668
Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.	8.217277017576233
— Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland.	12.274874896640009
I ’ ll be there.	11.97594737578706
Come, Kinch, the bards must drink.	16.118904184608184
Can you walk straight?	16.75806961822111
Laughing, he...	21.65870909926974
Swill till eleven.	16.654509490838045
Lubber...	19.513536995961765
Stephen followed a lubber...	11.458267517307506
One day in the national library we had a discussion.	20.303332413838817
Shakes.	53.34750102697415
After.	33.46862420931481
His lub back: I followed.	17.875053800141895
I gall his kibe.	11.919913905988865
Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.	11.262992477359157
What have I learned?	16.955200024483947
Of them?	25.6439919615101
Of me?	25.385875720997802
Walk like Haines now.	13.845176550199445
The constant readers ’ room.	11.980239479540359
In the readers ’ book Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables.	6.189767739878047
Item: was Hamlet mad?	13.911121998432069
The quaker ’ s pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.	13.343084148092426
— O please do, sir...	13.433414884748908
Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding: — A pleased bottom.	11.763074384949537
The turnstile.	22.319615270881965
Is that?...	16.244325618162822
Blueribboned hat...	19.20270838985766
Idly writing...	17.571054537100338
What?	14.617951109062046
Looked?...	15.483735795766657
The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.	7.082805593080124
Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling: John Eglinton, my jo, John, Why won ’ t you wed a wife?	9.3000524270873
He spluttered to the air: — O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton.	10.974951744945468
We went over to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers ’ hall.	18.014121687604646
Our players are creating a new art for Europe like the Greeks or M.	10.93451066932968
Maeterlinck.	44.25662045647404
Abbey Theatre! I smell the pubic sweat of monks.	11.29350559178355
He spat blank.	16.696329520193164
Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him.	9.905663217431384
And left the _femme de trente <URL> And why no other children born?	10.553949118897094
And his first child a girl?	17.172053494674447
Afterwit.	44.876532221709276
Go back.	25.087210849619595

I just eh...	14.901212521852576

I forgot...	15.851625964016385
he...	16.160191500467295
— Longworth and M ’ Curdy Atkinson were there...	10.233081287792022
Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling: I hardly hear the purlieu cry Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by Before my thoughts begin to run On F.	8.572629685253398
M ’ Curdy Atkinson, The same that had the wooden leg And that filibustering filibeg That never dared to slake his drouth, Magee that had the chinless mouth.	8.495359555751438
Jest on.	24.646646929962746
Know thyself.	22.38298217223015
Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me.	16.130735101488384
I halt.	26.577137822835113
— Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned.	10.821985214446139
Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature.	15.987534850698525
Only crows, priests and English coal are black.	8.467058650152286
A laugh tripped over his lips.	13.919267747896264
— Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory.	14.202647058001437
O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.	11.813122814640934
Couldn ’ t you do the Yeats touch?	15.825483577075385
He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms: — The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.	14.329547616999951
One thinks of Homer.	16.50449387616221
He stopped at the stairfoot.	21.52329477541435
The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined.	9.19249584872669
Gone the nine men ’ s morrice with caps of indices.	11.969141207820035
In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: _Everyman His Own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky <URL> He turned a happy patch ’ s smirk to Stephen, saying: — The disguise, I fear, is thin.	10.867504372597221
But listen.	24.324841507781265
He read, _marcato: _ — Characters: TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole) CRAB (a bushranger) MEDICAL DICK) and) (two birds with one stone) MEDICAL DAVY) MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier) FRESH NELLY and ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).	6.535352367422274
He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men: — O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit! — The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.	12.932439807503759
About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.	19.958050178176652
Part.	43.11253835167618
The moment is now.	15.076299227157627
Where then?	25.50014727540379
If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight.	11.416317533647593
Why?	18.457368458488407
That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.	16.009963175089847
My will: his will that fronts me.	12.450239933783406
Seas between.	24.69972114204345
A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.	15.646736392834935
— Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.	11.242270366203362
The portico.	20.38689311590405
Here I watched the birds for augury.	12.33690828599008
Ængus of the birds.	38.12668692973984
They go, they come.	26.850975537131006
Last night I flew.	17.583697284033676
Easily flew.	21.57747753479845
Men wondered.	23.532248554499777
Street of harlots after.	12.792042070550089
A creamfruit melon he held to me.	11.98228865458784
In. You will see.	13.91768701424445
— The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown ’ s awe.	13.586247351524909
Did you see his eye?	23.89385180832024
He looked upon you to lust after you.	13.075664546785275
I fear thee, ancient mariner.	14.378156785527159
O, Kinch, thou art in peril.	15.992960673675956
Get thee a breechpad.	12.165449261446069
Manner of Oxenford.	14.679575486394208
Day.	35.49411887597041
Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.	10.609771580039629
A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.	14.420876051828703
They followed.	23.05683083312174
Speak on.	26.758111616153627
Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street.	7.256517561009077
No birds.	23.396001437817496
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.	9.898894375777234
Cease to strive.	15.726570528331303
Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic: from wide earth an altar.	9.492328255966564
Laud we the gods And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils From our bless ’ d altars.	8.75676881187891
The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.	13.670258114296386
J.	9.525932994442917
reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps.	15.866973304885414
Five to three.	17.571740717745282
Just nice time to walk to Artane.	15.029504971103991
What was that boy ’ s name again?	19.599981501303933
Dignam.	28.61541969695315
Yes.	14.82237916275066

Mr Cunningham ’ s letter.	25.290600158526598
Yes.	14.82237916275066
Oblige him, if possible.	34.920217831696405
Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.	7.927745536083101
A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes.	8.390595701449678
He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S.	11.306103619567876
J.	9.525932994442917
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.	19.151938148703177
Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square.	11.552154817682377
He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey ’ s words: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old <URL> He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. — Very well, indeed, father.	13.80401218859032
And you, father?	32.86247524250224
Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed.	9.783305383971715
He would go to Buxton probably for the waters.	18.154427905155902
And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere?	14.036823068676163
Was that so?	22.303600557930757
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.	12.646640151922842
And Mr Sheehy himself?	13.325341402580426
Still in London.	17.012816491480116
The house was still sitting, to be sure it was.	17.720737018901865
Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed.	17.52755474398731
Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach.	12.507563422362319
O, yes: a very great success.	19.785352790668306
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy <URL>. Yes, he would certainly call.	14.690595647903974
— Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.	15.583194984298611
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun.	14.944415901639028
He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.	16.63440778928646
Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan ’ s droll eyes and cockney voice.	14.35051053793434
— Pilate! Wy don ’ t you old back that owlin mob?	8.74236405202407
A zealous man, however.	20.14824634331587
Really he was.	25.950370547708825
And really did great good in his way.	16.645801851999323
Beyond a doubt.	16.95431651502262
He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.	20.868066523387583
Of good family too would one think it?	12.382330401649282
Welsh, were they not?	26.15191135648136
O, lest he forget.	14.170689232217688
That letter to father provincial.	13.667149423893845
Yes: they were from Belvedere.	19.12473590777199
The little house.	19.1000877388031
Aha.	36.57812394567824
And were they good boys at school?	14.428239473405783
O.	16.57850871695433
That was very good now.	20.722083597229883
And what was his name?	21.03554496302194
Jack Sohan.	22.467322954558792
And his name?	20.65822845914721
Ger.	49.9750299142878
Gallaher.	51.75538385775211
And the other little man?	23.467084041545572
His name was Brunny Lynam.	13.731594736865263
O, that was a very nice name to have.	20.604180314131618
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.	13.487362820695086
— But mind you don ’ t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.	13.271023443138523
The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed: — O, sir.	12.58488126409552
— Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.	14.921049097469263
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee ’ s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.	15.822872641662569
Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.	10.816074138867547
Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam ’ s court.	9.924373753819694
Was that not Mrs M ’ Guinness?	14.556380706456446
Mrs M ’ Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed.	10.822336075596358
And Father Conmee smiled and saluted.	15.459621035827883
A fine carriage she had.	15.339984137932557
Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.	13.699845201158244
And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a...	16.012718853402383
what should he say?...	11.092200789267645
such a queenly mien.	17.96528681706413
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left.	12.308680352384325
The reverend T.	14.048985442709814
R.	23.024025358745593
Greene <URL>. will (<URL>.) speak.	24.876623822403186
The incumbent they called him.	13.878643468512195
He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words.	18.060465206395566
But one should be charitable.	17.609635139938895
Invincible ignorance.	22.449801410497564
They acted according to their lights.	17.15207541027614
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road.	12.994086173298914
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare.	15.392839032403518
Surely, there ought to be.	21.11605732979235
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.	8.166451901362835
All raised untidy caps.	12.69132280895605
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.	10.934732940870717
Christian brother boys.	18.46001883155054
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.	16.01807689631531
Saint Joseph ’ s church, Portland row.	15.717084252997813
For aged and virtuous females.	10.885448746722105
Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.	19.363627917797608
Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.	15.570991033621205
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman.	11.580540818554814
And now it was an office or something.	19.32418861097401
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.	16.45491333206149
Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.	6.713015506084777
He passed Grogan ’ s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York.	9.373836973001914
In America those things were continually happening.	10.429052296473657
Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.	18.00553641705465
Still, an act of perfect contrition.	18.022635251936737
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin ’ s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged.	12.854854348677314
They saluted him and were saluted.	19.95680427805904
Father Conmee passed H.	12.354900466593282
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Neill ’ s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.	10.718169558441367
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable.	12.982055348281502
In Youkstetter ’ s, the porkbutcher ’ s, Father Conmee observed pig ’ s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.	14.006534245290654
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him.	10.309762651188876
It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.	15.005897051143366
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.	10.116247002595188
J.	9.525932994442917
of saint Francis Xavier ’ s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.	11.543003607541609
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C.	9.119174604413908
C.	14.373100099742409
of saint Agatha ’ s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.	14.795266108467576
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.	8.256301334296008
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.	14.93489411753751
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket.	8.420468143322717
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap.	17.105513030604342
Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.	10.404826804236361
It was a peaceful day.	16.1366632777705
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down.	13.4164216835989
His wife, Father Conmee supposed.	20.355841560410134
A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses.	21.841948348023305
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.	7.769791254430829
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car.	17.213302422795945
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.	17.8509415535818
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight.	16.81339293136204
The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her.	10.079146973147386
She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you, my child, _ that they have been absolved, _pray for <URL> But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.	16.00157291712526
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.	6.651235232426658
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.	12.999490387409784
J.	9.525932994442917
and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night.	15.46766853358202
That book by the Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus, _ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea.	8.870402666457853
Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (<URL>.) been brought.	12.756367223577843
But they were God ’ s souls, created by God.	17.59114669759997
It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.	15.268461271631555
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.	14.779578392004534
The Malahide road was quiet.	11.791590262419593
It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.	12.454425892027501
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide.	8.579284506808833
Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.	9.004165024217711
Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.	15.997336381343208
Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.	11.404321049107123
Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.	12.948380269103358
A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged.	9.7104962448938
Who could know the truth?	19.994929868221913
Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, _ with her husband ’ s brother?	8.733989705283458
She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did.	12.07863454456522
Only God knew and she and he, her husband ’ s brother.	22.53815867276045
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man ’ s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.	13.631673538679186
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore.	12.51735389365321
He was humane and honoured there.	9.515827473556868
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.	13.037980009723343
It was a charming day.	17.681671218755326
The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves.	10.92179780223205
The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind.	11.328021948542075
_Moutonner, _ the French said.	18.469087288211412
A just and homely word.	11.831918676112437
Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey.	8.202546378604417
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field.	10.005530519744964
He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys ’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening.	22.415376939227986
He was their rector: his reign was mild.	9.789923472687544
Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.	11.192765931013636
An ivory bookmark told him the page.	16.72432829486208
Nones.	44.876532221709276
He should have read that before lunch.	15.812310112730419
But lady Maxwell had come.	13.092601187368311
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.	8.027814024242886
_Deus in <URL> He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ <URL> A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand.	8.987043238164327
The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	11.28475622545047
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary.	13.127652761119702
_Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor <URL> * * * Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner.	7.207302467442182
He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings.	11.34651355727218
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway.	13.147215638753279
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.	11.968120087575624
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.	11.544994353040185
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.	9.550689662326869
Constable <NUM> C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.	15.590824625943865
— That ’ s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.	16.74613197020819
— Ay, Corny Kelleher said.	9.958790519485673
— It ’ s very close, the constable said.	16.264925078566463
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.	9.175092245945123
— What ’ s the best news?	12.108576700855034
he asked.	10.295735601437203
— I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.	12.945456642955163
Towards Larry O ’ Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably: — _For England_...	15.614540389310093
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled: — _home and <URL> J.	9.299635256953046
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy ’ s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.	15.76429637295774
A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her.	12.071054163870139
The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.	9.877114457523486
He halted and growled angrily: — _For England_...	9.802115455062493
Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.	10.388325510655527
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply: — _home and <URL> The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.	10.07885741774409
The blind of the window was drawn aside.	18.568269395807285
A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps.	11.242663277721919
A woman ’ s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.	14.222650149083904
It fell on the path.	23.340106910014708
One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel ’ s cap, saying: — There, sir.	17.275853330551655
* * * Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.	12.31918918882383
— Did you put in the books?	25.302113178113057
Boody asked.	20.388740064116877
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.	9.255449619229983
— They wouldn ’ t give anything on them, she said.	15.236255816392092
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.	10.26527675425586
— Where did you try?	22.990228730715867
Boody asked.	20.388740064116877
— M ’ Guinness ’ s.	13.106444136335922
Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.	14.088995706360683
— Bad cess to her big face! she cried.	12.635965646224406
Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.	14.87137911924669
— What ’ s in the pot?	19.65850965913066
she asked.	16.944107288055257
— Shirts, Maggy said.	9.086545239613162
Boody cried angrily: — Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?	19.466023655090883
Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked: — And what ’ s in this?	18.36341372679499
A heavy fume gushed in answer.	9.964528206373746
— Peasoup, Maggy said.	9.086545239613162
Katey asked.	24.289009134028507
— Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.	9.400140825827828
The lacquey rang his bell.	10.247878487113578
— Barang! Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily: — Give us it here.	14.438677294521376
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl.	16.756535437153776
Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs: — A good job we have that much.	15.57552153555271
Where ’ s Dilly?	24.2520854374793
— Gone to meet father, Maggy said.	12.958789075631161
Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added: — Our father who art not in heaven.	14.100368745345452
Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey ’ s bowl, exclaimed: — Boody! For shame! A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George ’ s quay.	9.111413544499417
* * * The blond girl in Thornton ’ s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre.	8.30017501534736
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.	12.946909830403293
— Put these in first, will you?	13.380092839873564
he said.	10.465399985534118
— Yes, sir, the blond girl said.	13.563261998942785
And the fruit on top.	14.163041577037015
— That ’ ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.	10.72661152772022
She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.	10.539456351102114
Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.	8.681558556882365
H.	23.035625582092514
E.	17.860184031499212
L.	21.061307083543863
Y. ’ S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.	9.741995926651224
He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain ’ s length.	13.3913273547863
— Can you send them by tram?	16.139179390395945
Now?	36.02559857417337
A darkbacked figure under Merchants ’ arch scanned books on the hawker ’ s cart.	11.740433518698746
— Certainly, sir.	11.02859168345434
Is it in the city?	32.461365858319354
— O, yes, Blazes Boylan said.	12.48587032701539
Ten minutes.	25.895837945792103
The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.	13.00539406216274
— Will you write the address, sir?	13.812825298116843
Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.	12.670620248062157
— Send it at once, will you?	16.796075009227398
he said.	10.465399985534118
It ’ s for an invalid.	15.405680010209377
— Yes, sir.	7.883810949841353
I will, sir.	14.377027350163731
Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers ’ pocket.	13.678677151175005
— What ’ s the damage?	12.876739363776904
he asked.	10.295735601437203
The blond girl ’ s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.	12.447417763290893
Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse.	21.76569255405765
A young pullet.	14.89724769081186
He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.	16.187783328953742
he asked gallantly.	15.183820111471752
The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.	13.949754999544686
— Yes, sir, she said.	9.365025543602583
Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.	7.279410142369953
Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.	16.697626149603973
— May I say a word to your telephone, missy?	14.782511834252208
he asked roguishly.	14.116928810645915
* * * _ — Ma! _ Almidano Artifoni said.	11.916203474987883
He gazed over Stephen ’ s shoulder at Goldsmith ’ s knobby poll.	13.313306374262028
Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests.	8.497136781453884
Palefaces.	44.25662045647404
Men ’ s arms frankly round their stunted forms.	13.632029263442773
They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.	13.446671437248318
— _Anch ’ io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand ’ ero giovine come Lei.	5.024166933346316
Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.	4.70184771559591
È peccato.	19.698768402221454
Perchè la sua voce...	8.742889671202105
sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.	6.617925950788135
_ — Speriamo, _ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly.	10.262885011896408
_Ma, dia retta a me.	8.93483640099243
Ci rifletta_.	19.698768402221454
By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.	9.099952820407944
— _Ci rifletterò, _ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.	13.88900018763107
— _Ma, sul serio, eh? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	7.609282715219783
His heavy hand took Stephen ’ s firmly.	16.138986887896888
Human eyes.	23.748002397050932
They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.	10.35918416192889
_ — Eccolo, _ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste.	12.424729906130755
_Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi.	7.8848180412831645
Addio, <URL> — _Arrivederla, maestro, _ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed.	14.74812531067986
_E <URL> — _Di che? _ Almidano Artifoni said.	9.759993893492151
_Scusi, eh?	15.580587241086967
In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.	5.889880863973753
* * * Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_ far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.	7.714292441398827
Too much mystery business in it.	11.350498234096188
Is he in love with that one, Marion?	23.263098352748973
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.	11.90469144964424
The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.	7.872809846507262
Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard: — <NUM> June <NUM>.	18.03387038130672
Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny ’ s corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone ’ s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H.	11.280519512820485
E.	17.860184031499212
L.	21.061307083543863
Y. ’ S and plodded back as they had come.	14.649677871497476
Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses.	9.199034090166679
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks.	16.1442414412364
She ’ s not nicelooking, is she?	17.588219583047312
The way she ’ s holding up her bit of a skirt.	22.739210460049392
Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight.	19.333538848681712
If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle ’ s.	9.704978524878438
They kick out grand.	13.803659550576729
Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.	16.496171984915378
Hope to goodness he won ’ t keep me here till seven.	12.518298995974483
— Hello.	14.773143049833322
Yes, sir.	9.971021983540197
No, sir.	12.671120635307762
Yes, sir.	9.971021983540197
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	11.357704764107897
Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool.	20.282337469561057
All right, sir.	16.06671521024506
Then I can go after six if you ’ re not back.	15.676198950344947
A quarter after.	19.23639918954978
Yes, sir.	9.971021983540197
Twentyseven and six.	17.5942686655388
I ’ ll tell him.	11.054267655668962
Yes: one, seven, six.	19.5299000694059
She scribbled three figures on an envelope.	11.821779352070067
— Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.	11.621644476336224
Mr Lenehan, yes.	23.880927868133135
He said he ’ ll be in the Ormond at four.	18.86200362198222
No, sir.	12.671120635307762
Yes, sir.	9.971021983540197
I ’ ll ring them up after five.	11.357704764107897
* * * Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.	14.92225976159121
— Who ’ s that?	13.614688725113785
Ned Lambert asked.	13.19959248234421
Is that Crotty?	16.260659234032033
— Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.	11.942178087096721
— Hello, Jack, is that yourself?	17.382427712404358
Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches.	9.366920478166842
Come on.	19.227485892247252
Mind your steps there.	15.483709576413961
The vesta in the clergyman ’ s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall.	17.667683069860324
At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.	9.295236816077717
— How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.	12.807048446447777
— Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily.	9.842591786285482
We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary ’ s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in <NUM>.	11.884222335029023
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.	17.426766640281308
The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews ’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road.	12.985538301743427
You were never here before, Jack, were you?	18.38242937302176
— No, Ned.	15.24332768277961
— He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me.	12.681341707459506
— That ’ s right, Ned Lambert said.	10.969049547251423
That ’ s quite right, sir.	14.407889273979082
— If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...	20.468710384703023
— Certainly, Ned Lambert said.	9.46394656942249
Bring the camera whenever you like.	11.607881094306876
I ’ ll get those bags cleared away from the windows.	12.88164321490826
You can take it from here or from here.	18.21248376571013
In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.	9.566012171550534
From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.	14.161620091338262
— I ’ m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said.	15.279956527318872
I won ’ t trespass on your valuable time...	13.187357723670885
— You ’ re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said.	10.415855965891149
Drop in whenever you like.	14.139918156125434
Next week, say.	16.99965602167033
Can you see?	23.04156766041273
— Yes, yes.	10.322981487806095
Good afternoon, Mr Lambert.	23.71209396077523
Very pleased to have met you.	22.860222718084536
— Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.	12.89728821056912
He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars.	13.697231501444714
With J.	21.39052493416004
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary ’ s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O ’ Connor, Wexford.	7.5719428344468325
He stood to read the card in his hand.	19.235485273499094
— The reverend Hugh C.	10.22416387717154
Present address: Saint Michael ’ s, Sallins.	12.936858919553103
Nice young chap he is.	13.881531289120698
He ’ s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me.	13.304012901481117
He ’ s well up in history, faith.	15.925674015647111
The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	8.94624295368103
— I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.	13.80344308672017
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Molloy said.	9.253323995634037
Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.	15.819642417591615
— God! he cried.	17.115406899573532
I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.	15.910673957992824
You know that one?	28.72376376538136
_I ’ m bloody sorry I did it, _ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was <URL> He mightn ’ t like it, though.	16.456358115357734
What?	14.617951109062046
God, I ’ ll tell him anyhow.	16.629445500983337
That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor.	21.865854000956855
Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.	22.357589881571258
The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness.	10.228167686844321
He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried: — Woa, sonny! He turned to J.	10.941703493872774
O ’ Molloy and asked: — Well, Jack.	15.039981803255465
What is it?	12.175206074269104
What ’ s the trouble?	16.972091164289626
Wait awhile.	18.71606967019696
Hold hard.	22.544037867931745
With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.	13.809770467352958
— Chow! he said.	11.953759325208129
Blast you! — The dust from those sacks, J.	14.30021586287665
J.	9.525932994442917
— No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a...	13.660474654431805
cold night before...	17.184039807988185
blast your soul...	17.141201525015823
night before last...	16.498092805862793
and there was a hell of a lot of draught...	16.87101237149205
He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...	18.461188952084388
— I was...	12.805812053559139
Glasnevin this morning...	17.65752221823996
poor little...	18.374319114449513
what do you call him...	14.969233459957959
Chow!...	16.56286689282615
Mother of Moses! * * * Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.	11.34512315743286
— See?	18.533198393047964
he said.	10.465399985534118
Say it ’ s turn six.	21.47329654756255
In here, see.	24.83204406385871
Turn Now On. He slid it into the left slot for them.	13.191842086441477
It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.	8.419356757328835
Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king ’ s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.	8.658365741771501
— See?	18.533198393047964
See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.	16.533709105746585
The impact.	22.319615270881965
Leverage, see?	19.269664257569563
He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.	12.433015843249889
— Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	13.10676688711914
So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.	14.788107914438438
— See?	18.533198393047964
Tom Rochford said.	14.098461208411608
He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four.	10.707684574506532
Turn Now On. — I ’ ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him.	18.973784665946752
One good turn deserves another.	12.588820301759757
— Do, Tom Rochford said.	11.28847019503163
Tell him I ’ m Boylan with impatience.	16.09363382674728
— Goodnight, M ’ Coy said abruptly.	10.5749690068388
When you two begin...	13.138779611750778
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.	11.294127621220971
— But how does it work here, Tommy?	16.241117329494305
he asked.	10.295735601437203
— Tooraloo, Lenehan said.	10.227220042689959
See you later.	18.43707788332833
— He ’ s a hero, he said simply.	16.266774233803986
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	9.26305558024279
The drain, you mean.	18.5182744234778
— Drain?	20.282520284002942
Lenehan said.	15.25892727513949
It was down a manhole.	17.495770279898178
They passed Dan Lowry ’ s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.	9.669951368349146
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M ’ Coy how the whole thing was.	11.005062478161525
One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas.	15.528682312427113
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky ’ s vest and all, with the rope round him.	16.812509391026737
And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.	17.947707993339684
— The act of a hero, he said.	16.089253038147866
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.	7.262691868906788
— This way, he said, walking to the right.	22.8668688391094
I want to pop into Lynam ’ s to see Sceptre ’ s starting price.	16.43768348335914
What ’ s the time by your gold watch and chain?	15.594066853200161
M ’ Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses ’ sombre office, then at O ’ Neill ’ s clock.	11.172590125274708
— After three, he said.	13.412494297533568
Who ’ s riding her?	19.300977109615275
— O.	13.965256730298949
Madden, Lenehan said.	16.23865279845109
While he waited in Temple bar M ’ Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter.	11.570609053293598
Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.	11.734095140882152
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.	19.151644152641857
— Even money, Lenehan said returning.	16.57769939342487
I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn ’ t an earthly.	13.968862870959784
Through here.	23.765942362207888
They went up the steps and under Merchants ’ arch.	15.407522251189686
— There he is, Lenehan said.	12.899354817262187
— Wonder what he ’ s buying, M ’ Coy said, glancing behind.	15.621655349603659
— _Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, _ Lenehan said.	17.600970043151694
— He ’ s dead nuts on sales, M ’ Coy said.	8.52983982956462
I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob.	20.252118169418974
There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails.	15.766047064206221
Astronomy it was about.	34.78270299672698
Lenehan laughed.	25.92215771306962
— I ’ ll tell you a damn good one about comets ’ tails, he said.	10.315371914370617
Come over in the sun.	23.729162863823777
They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.	17.29873960477748
Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.	13.625607981967937
— There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly.	12.023341209953317
The annual dinner, you know.	14.461926961192463
Boiled shirt affair.	16.15970059610129
The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music.	14.157251010133304
Bartell d ’ Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...	10.088019092948919
— I know, M ’ Coy broke in.	11.678583457756867
My missus sang there once.	12.173677538453274
— Did she?	18.641755632697166
Lenehan said.	15.25892727513949
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number <NUM> Eccles street.	9.330857720229279
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.	13.136620508715836
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	11.403513083566025
Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher.	8.239421439818162
Bloom and the wife were there.	26.97311533885852
Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice.	9.342410990623431
Fast and furious it was.	16.008448544069722
After liquids came solids.	10.513682177446068
Cold joints galore and mince pies...	6.862736579059997
— I know, M ’ Coy said.	9.26305558024279
The year the missus was there...	12.839565677489283
Lenehan linked his arm warmly.	15.207455587954495
— But wait till I tell you, he said.	11.403513083566025
We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o ’ clock the morning after the night before.	15.893034749434069
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter ’ s night on the Featherbed Mountain.	19.78005379994391
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other.	23.088440715200694
We started singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_.	8.878989986883967
She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt ’ s port under her bellyband.	13.730338724559079
Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me.	12.325471243843996
Hell ’ s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her.	18.80100106107133
Like that.	17.041964513101775
He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning: — I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.	11.166894479965128
He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.	16.452713943613677
— The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.	15.51983081751712
She ’ s a gamey mare and no mistake.	12.090709638587438
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot.	19.57656824610087
But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way.	19.800190596138812
He knows them all, faith.	18.28649602271323
_And what star is that, Poldy? _ says she.	17.83288201385724
By God, she had Bloom cornered.	17.92022164651132
_That one, is it? _ says Chris Callinan, _sure that ’ s only what you might call a <URL> By God, he wasn ’ t far wide of the mark.	17.586037688451214
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.	13.371603893004773
— I ’ m weak, he gasped.	16.399275527105285
M ’ Coy ’ s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.	12.648840759669428
Lenehan walked on again.	20.014953636701183
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly.	7.612108966422795
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M ’ Coy.	15.609228620041764
— He ’ s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously.	15.492933628269427
He ’ s not one of your common or garden...	14.3902450787941
you know...	14.682089564012701
There ’ s a touch of the artist about old Bloom.	16.866053039225864
* * * Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk_, then of Aristotle ’ s <URL> Crooked botched print.	8.907526528024217
Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows.	7.913612389969445
Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world.	19.032770761798893
All butting with their skulls to get out of it.	15.680672906882368
Child born every minute somewhere.	13.88288232179725
Mrs Purefoy.	23.570319264001093
He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.	10.610762589934238
— That I had, he said, pushing it by.	17.128395866712204
The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.	11.060007877324063
— Them are two good ones, he said.	9.849401220591629
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.	22.75075207107868
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.	11.894292180924756
On O ’ Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c.	8.084787500329735
Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles.	18.982259079690724
_Fair Tyrants_ by James Lovebirch.	11.698734705087121
Know the kind that is.	16.42402775420686
Had it?	24.792817198085256
Yes.	14.82237916275066
He opened it.	16.92762905472552
Thought so.	21.063299184426825
A woman ’ s voice behind the dingy curtain.	15.088879805613407
Listen: the man.	32.52287830778403
Got her it once.	15.33616938753067
He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_.	13.08005943701164
More in her line.	28.5152130039622
Let us see.	17.841353483828097
He read where his finger opened.	15.85726135106271
For him! For Raoul! _ Yes.	18.71745543475954
This.	28.80116903865326
Here.	19.800593100854
Try.	41.75502599170982
— _Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her <URL> Yes.	11.956211838756053
Take this.	25.8296565054389
The end.	21.64570242324618
— You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.	13.902961286384999
The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint.	6.881637712981575
An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.	14.212903171311686
Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful <URL> Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh.	8.982910522805229
Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up.	5.967423139152743
His nostrils arched themselves for prey.	10.37702761713408
Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul! _).	10.941685092823521
Armpits ’ oniony sweat.	11.435853712640425
Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint! _).	9.857664047578172
Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions! Young! Young! An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king ’ s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor ’ s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.	9.785014952211586
Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains.	14.86345397168723
The shopman ’ s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing.	15.689793944908356
He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor.	8.857426421298488
He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.	10.551593972551576
Mr Bloom beheld it.	14.503263489942475
Mastering his troubled breath, he said: — I ’ ll take this one.	14.205847404048274
The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.	7.759457546385516
— _Sweets of Sin, _ he said, tapping on it.	16.24348846880689
That ’ s a good one.	13.649221696509036
Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within.	24.008753589140607
Four and nine.	18.178938362411774
Those lovely curtains.	16.30556564158653
Five shillings.	23.461809881173092
Cosy curtains.	21.251463663385504
Selling new at two guineas.	13.775352634872304
Any advance on five shillings?	14.473823651356263
Going for five shillings.	15.410103367377149
The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it: — Barang! Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.	9.979570965158828
J.	9.525932994442917
A.	12.889029081532971
Jackson, W.	14.860250049243493
E.	17.860184031499212
Munro and H.	16.300299237538994
T.	20.980755442869455
Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.	11.759944272939043
Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams ’ s row.	13.643118849576489
He halted near his daughter.	16.15348262724968
— It ’ s time for you, she said.	17.155795437916304
— Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.	16.374624172763376
Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?	14.173734723618004
Melancholy God! Dilly shrugged her shoulders.	11.407161956527819
Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.	18.529940298609738
— Stand up straight, girl, he said.	10.223355777916488
You ’ ll get curvature of the spine.	18.141593943088665
Do you know what you look like?	18.838121485944338
He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.	11.347731958671645
— Give it up, father, Dilly said.	15.653352488645934
All the people are looking at you.	15.348656765555207
Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.	11.404592865235212
— Did you get any money?	16.29450428545762
Dilly asked.	25.22354960166188
— Where would I get money?	18.443881100482788
Mr Dedalus said.	8.43077714347946
There is no - one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.	14.025840285106549
— You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.	15.36287988762781
— How do you know that?	15.088387904471793
Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.	25.83052980248163
Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James ’ s street.	13.400096573729504
— I know you did, Dilly answered.	14.892847447497383
Were you in the Scotch house now?	20.383164241135812
Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy?	18.9439055957861
Here.	19.800593100854
— See if you can do anything with that, he said.	16.44160423741058
— I suppose you got five, Dilly said.	11.984217216130487
Give me more than that.	21.082102839263282
— Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly.	14.184235026032129
You ’ re like the rest of them, are you?	17.867201674817597
An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died.	9.470187613776606
But wait awhile.	16.626251097993322
You ’ ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me.	16.499374806655783
Low blackguardism! I ’ m going to get rid of you.	14.44095937517905
Wouldn ’ t care if I was stretched out stiff.	18.492072698985833
He ’ s dead.	14.683685808488738
The man upstairs is dead.	11.60785898668668
He left her and walked on.	19.46884510156948
Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.	14.178660561488709
— Well, what is it?	13.428478875439867
he said, stopping.	18.94166856676873
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.	8.650315556503575
— Barang! — Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.	14.114067459169894
The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly: — Bang! Mr Dedalus stared at him.	10.223247163916698
— Watch him, he said.	13.726629359119991
It ’ s instructive.	18.792591826816164
— You got more than that, father, Dilly said.	14.74417980259152
— I ’ m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said.	13.00310955691281
I ’ ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews.	12.591004915465767
Look, there ’ s all I have.	22.27284315805856
I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.	17.2934147211675
He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.	10.330582424177521
— Can ’ t you look for some money somewhere?	18.162343373605573
Dilly said.	19.552042752208937
Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.	14.238312653325666
— I will, he said gravely.	18.244312001239784
I looked all along the gutter in O ’ Connell street.	12.310106096169815
I ’ ll try this one now.	11.709933562475143
— You ’ re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.	12.389039063911387
— Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies.	13.610300721859502
Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something.	18.27727390547319
I ’ ll be home shortly.	10.459820800471487
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.	17.657598646876416
The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.	11.170654172373068
— I ’ m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.	9.958920250065288
The lacquey banged loudly.	11.258105867104149
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently: — The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn ’ t do anything! O, sure they wouldn ’ t really! Is it little sister Monica! * * * From the sundial towards James ’ s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James ’ s street, past Shackleton ’ s offices.	11.290799365916962
Got round him all right.	22.09408361487412
How do you do, Mr Crimmins?	17.906553577040036
First rate, sir.	15.55116351908555
I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico.	16.094765012770655
How are things going?	14.673254004155549
Just keeping alive.	15.115271592012489
Lovely weather we ’ re having.	20.858389654031164
Yes, indeed.	16.791101880572928
Good for the country.	34.25230042765998
Those farmers are always grumbling.	12.126089755540628
I ’ ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins.	13.059829449127697
Yes, sir.	9.971021983540197
Terrible affair that _General Slocum_ explosion.	7.410472997426324
Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.	13.954713373954121
And heartrending scenes.	15.464776525221874
Men trampling down women and children.	11.384845686787251
Most brutal thing.	16.181728833368883
What do they say was the cause?	28.247083729670358
Spontaneous combustion.	20.531908815027172
Most scandalous revelation.	15.282062214143838
Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst.	11.00699156628597
What I can ’ t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that...	10.654401335539914
Now, you ’ re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.	17.438872313754
You know why?	18.3280700290035
Palm oil.	22.959212159346134
Is that a fact?	15.197842437318508
Without a doubt.	20.846677882372074
Well now, look at that.	23.842386566104224
And America they say is the land of the free.	24.434009035005456
I thought we were bad here.	16.804723971821346
I smiled at him.	17.92529834890871
_America, _ I said quietly, just like that.	24.278481948624837
_What is it?	20.312394328166363
The sweepings of every country including our own.	10.005936253342762
Isn ’ t that true? _ That ’ s a fact.	17.469206117756425
Graft, my dear sir.	21.2887970608494
Well, of course, where there ’ s money going there ’ s always someone to pick it up.	17.2767530115731
Saw him looking at my frockcoat.	18.476627912875166
Dress does it.	18.499281351279386
Nothing like a dressy appearance.	20.72243936354398
Bowls them over.	19.26150009479843
— Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	9.113495402687674
How are things?	16.128296129859155
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	12.730624754387295
Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser.	10.229033646615395
Stylish coat, beyond a doubt.	13.70421316073336
Scott of Dawson street.	13.606714940396046
Never built under three guineas.	12.965724575384828
Fits me down to the ground.	20.486296274390156
Some Kildare street club toff had it probably.	10.591340464329992
John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.	16.938346695651404
Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows.	12.53511233277619
Knight of the road.	32.72551426536244
Gentleman.	51.98932121274747
And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir.	17.53890771765548
The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.	14.047036095687504
North wall and sir John Rogerson ’ s quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.	11.245362770941277
Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image.	14.324326189399521

What?	14.617951109062046
Yes.	14.82237916275066
He ’ s as like it as damn it.	14.2885292052625
No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there.	16.159189330525695
Damn like him.	20.77417622066247
Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.	8.35084041445525

Well, well.	18.415997229065702
Better turn down here.	14.463909103475384
Make a detour.	14.77445805686862
Outside the Dublin Distillers Company ’ s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel.	12.190043685365632
Damn dangerous thing.	15.58839183148066

Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.	12.45999409789525
His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair.	10.400518490930382
Damn it! What a pity! * * * Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary ’ s fingers prove a timedulled chain.	10.721467545741126
Dust webbed the window and the showtrays.	20.638345287551747
Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.	10.950330339075556
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.	7.136386702400889
Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness.	14.766389552976198

A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her.	7.856259524406057
A long and seafed silent rut.	10.986791467296456
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.	9.046286339686583
Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses ’ beard.	14.479790441216409

Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife ’ s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.	14.198054557328357
The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on.	8.632888608439986
Beingless beings.	22.44976562170923
Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within.	13.546881735588494
Your heart you sing of.	13.286927216889769

Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.	11.105751169952745
Shatter them, one and both.	32.202821687149225
But stun myself too in the blow.	19.351025779950053
Shatter me you who can.	17.38676786529122
Bawd and butcher were the words.	15.964157337902632
I say! Not yet awhile.	16.305799712946744
A look around.	17.41899182144984
Yes, quite true.	16.446288737497202
You say right, sir.	14.793874017751644
Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade.	17.561212838566213
In Clohissey ’ s window a faded <NUM> print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye.	8.764067684063448
Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering.	8.360375463075846

And they are throbbing: heroes ’ hearts.	10.17435011118403
He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.	13.59322028135666

Dilly ’ s high shoulders and shabby dress.	17.1586649230462
Shut the book quick.	20.444782916801724
Don ’ t let see.	15.397694352929872
Stephen said.	12.163642004899454
A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides.	7.763463382066351
It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots.	10.381148280655562
I told her of Paris.	16.664159475734394

_Nebrakada <URL> — What have you there?	26.608773285022345
Stephen asked.	15.442182356790978
— I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously.	17.722588215676957
Is it any good?	20.38018837683256
My eyes they say she has.	21.63441330218986

Quick, far and daring.	14.287898817729193

He took the coverless book from her hand.	13.435460898691762
Chardenal ’ s French primer.	27.327589528963614
— What did you buy that for?	18.976936101819675
he asked.	10.295735601437203
To learn French?	18.217733954613166
She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.	8.55733892094609
Show no surprise.	18.007279619870946
Quite natural.	25.46113939998074

Misery! Misery! * * * — Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	8.863522642889622
How are things?	16.128296129859155
— Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	12.730624754387295
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter ’ s.	7.608738280560907
Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.	11.019735256646415
— What ’ s the best news?	12.108576700855034
Mr Dedalus said.	8.43077714347946
— Why then not much, Father Cowley said.	11.012624353501332
I ’ m barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.	14.877515137989203
— Jolly, Mr Dedalus said.	11.13176162696177
Who is it?	18.55905196865837
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.	17.12540892760539
— With a broken back, is it?	19.61602865843891
Mr Dedalus asked.	12.277348434955702
— The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered.	14.630821196129956
Reuben of that ilk.	27.722534084715136
He ’ s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off.	16.636244653578224
All I want is a little time.	25.24545267251503
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.	15.595527095495646
— I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	15.411416465217425
Poor old bockedy Ben! He ’ s always doing a good turn for someone.	14.396976238904271
Hold hard! He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.	17.43859141263199
— There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.	15.571148474966213
Ben Dollard ’ s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.	9.184035406244321
He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.	9.220736759516047
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted: — Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.	19.61806938744494
— Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.	13.803432602843069
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard ’ s figure.	11.354377393632095
Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly: — That ’ s a pretty garment, isn ’ t it, for a summer ’ s day?	18.633778722554588
— Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.	12.135817503800936
He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying: — They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.	16.820147158257132
— Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.	16.16699897140252
Thanks be to God he ’ s not paid yet.	16.800368951800813
— And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin?	11.459435945840575
Father Cowley asked.	18.05407093940838
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.	7.116973442381046
Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter ’ s mouth, gave forth a deep note.	14.979886622033776
— Aw! he said.	10.901805409899781
— That ’ s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.	12.28645790356754
— What about that?	17.889881243767118
Ben Dollard said.	12.369776078564836
Not too dusty?	17.499001914163777
What?	14.617951109062046
He turned to both.	15.013850742861433
— That ’ ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.	14.76770517508909
The reverend Hugh C.	10.247436636046158
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.	14.951051083830048
— Come along with me to the subsheriff ’ s office, he said.	17.208158197382343
I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.	17.269499109060447
He ’ s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun.	8.125096342906389
He ’ s well worth seeing, mind you.	12.321444433535657
Come along.	24.6163367800373
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don ’ t...	14.036044678500755
Wait awhile...	15.346623778398635
We ’ re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.	15.685411733097013
— For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.	16.335726088260955
Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.	12.711994489561299
— What few days?	16.450717838655088
he boomed.	20.716189822330634
Hasn ’ t your landlord distrained for rent?	12.316019427352437
— He has, Father Cowley said.	10.990429083814924
— Then our friend ’ s writ is not worth the paper it ’ s printed on, Ben Dollard said.	16.24468377724638
The landlord has the prior claim.	11.494535451912839
I gave him all the particulars.	21.228740352002117
<NUM> Windsor avenue.	13.439121909052046
Love is the name?	33.521630961571184
— That ’ s right, Father Cowley said.	11.524657085694574
The reverend Mr Love.	15.353826141616171
He ’ s a minister in the country somewhere.	17.10309003807657
But are you sure of that?	26.86857631356545
— You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.	14.17870435706707
He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.	16.282136123540116
— Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.	14.444458257746778
* * * — The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.	15.442454259145501
The policeman touched his forehead.	14.20488518586139
— God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.	16.850055742844226
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.	13.88442952549187
Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy ’ s head by Miss Douce ’ s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.	15.139058954656054
— Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.	11.906951010836146
I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.	15.0590996955198
— You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.	13.499906998402224
— Boyd?	23.224858223979748
Martin Cunningham said shortly.	12.988508555941968
Touch me not.	19.724029475195874
John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.	9.854141282554862
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.	7.58076051802541
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.	8.066734868653823
— Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_ office.	15.378779188926428
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.	15.371833399087118
— Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.	14.141479934760202
And put down the five shillings too.	20.31804150682843
— Without a second word either, Mr Power said.	12.165458171463813
— Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.	11.782680744216888
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.	10.724058174872116
— I ’ ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.	14.85164138030807
They went down Parliament street.	15.019229175371363
— There ’ s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh ’ s.	12.752566412917908
— Righto, Martin Cunningham said.	9.322737475393028
Here goes.	21.414731435237787
Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney ’ s brother - in - law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.	9.390041719025929
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson ’ s watches.	13.764879344728122
— The assistant town clerk ’ s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.	10.409269135434423
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh ’ s winerooms.	15.744947735901464
The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.	9.257710705059703
Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.	9.392927653064138
— And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.	13.8583988419232
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.	14.845645700506948
— Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.	13.611215562983944
Long John Fanning made no way for them.	11.122566757731908
He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.	9.695054522689903
— Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?	5.882661086335022
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.	12.872996425217762
Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language.	10.299549434899538
Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber.	26.904699428858592
And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him.	11.606763387195784
Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.	15.76534734987754
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.	10.999488410717822
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.	12.061258350860085
— What Dignam was that?	15.889071046266466
long John Fanning asked.	13.83506507225056
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.	18.539141912877692
— O, my corns! he said plaintively.	16.505325563911732
Come upstairs for goodness ’ sake till I sit down somewhere.	12.169150692214394
Uff! Ooo! Mind! Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning ’ s flank and passed in and up the stairs.	12.302123320507004
I don ’ t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.	14.99376110325803
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.	15.644224490342628
— Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.	14.175863560169756
— Rather lowsized.	14.656052494686964
Dignam of Menton ’ s office that was, Martin Cunningham said.	14.807831539127886
Long John Fanning could not remember him.	13.182329722007633
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.	12.515996754334692
— What ’ s that?	11.872792500682896
Martin Cunningham said.	8.623899982574008
All turned where they stood.	17.632472238815943
John Wyse Nolan came down again.	12.93288675965139
From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.	11.724968361019315
Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.	14.93873321723908
In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.	14.277786293019117
— What was it?	17.178339255556633
Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.	18.753520542025193
— The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.	10.616684972648281
* * * As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines: — Parnell ’ s brother.	12.207092068798366
There in the corner.	28.19772903080532
They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.	9.519789293057963
— Is that he?	20.88086491002513
Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.	21.15940927958686
— Yes, Mulligan said.	12.234365234345878
That ’ s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.	17.82807191220969
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.	11.612958994143366
An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.	12.869515425095528
— I ’ ll take a _mélange, _ Haines said to the waitress.	15.137221093115373
— Two _mélanges, _ Buck Mulligan said.	11.0759298547797
And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.	11.84191878601816
When she had gone he said, laughing: — We call it <URL>. because they have damn bad cakes.	21.51526625621314
O, but you missed Dedalus on <URL> Haines opened his newbought book.	9.469699161134974
— I ’ m sorry, he said.	9.362885270575568
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.	16.589865279400243
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of <NUM> Nelson street: — _England expects_...	14.340238288159382
Buck Mulligan ’ s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.	14.316594847590084
— You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.	15.43137961387613
Wandering Ængus I call him.	14.282593742142234
— I am sure he has an _idée fixe, _ Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger.	10.96838188682029
Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be.	17.604088358340753
Such persons always have.	13.601464385498875
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.	16.288862246862756
— They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.	13.691236161872345
He will never capture the Attic note.	8.708181439894926
That is his tragedy.	19.353429261479974
He can never be a poet.	21.315184717619445
The joy of creation...	12.664662866247111
— Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.	11.93725792823535
I see.	15.5305652366756
I tackled him this morning on belief.	12.914421667430991
There was something on his mind, I saw.	27.15343324128257
It ’ s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.	9.34265910235813
Buck Mulligan ’ s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.	12.960865627865587
He helped her to unload her tray.	11.902480786684253
— He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups.	10.164016884488486
The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution.	14.768165091457085
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.	13.486821862881904
Does he write anything for your movement?	14.99853016868156
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.	9.534730635812853
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith.	7.252827026918352
He bit off a soft piece hungrily.	17.446134187134895
— Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.	17.286063331753258
He is going to write something in ten years.	16.09088336940354
— Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.	14.378078058883288
Still, I shouldn ’ t wonder if he did after all.	20.384992376502414
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.	16.33963007233924
— This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.	14.12480789514876
I don ’ t want to be imposed on.	12.865467052036664
Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson ’ s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	6.984744018502337
* * * Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell ’ s yard.	11.065313713419924
Behind him Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith ’ s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square.	9.545141511087675
Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.	17.203947766722358
Cashel Boyle O ’ Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner ’ s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.	9.975840966574864
At the corner of Wilde ’ s house he halted, frowned at Elijah ’ s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke ’ s lawn.	14.853591593120507
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.	13.478834067430437
With ratsteeth bared he muttered: — _Coactus <URL> He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.	10.265047365291663
As he strode past Mr Bloom ’ s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body.	8.41883642725225
The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.	10.354040368623496
— God ’ s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You ’ re blinder nor I am, you bitch ’ s bastard! * * * Opposite Ruggy O ’ Donohoe ’ s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan ’ s, late Fehrenbach ’ s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.	11.915085920414358
It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney ’ s.	11.53957122781681
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.	10.623673938816994
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him.	8.139589729601814
From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently.	6.373304082601411
Gob, that ’ d be a good pucking match to see.	17.557006860279152
Myler Keogh, that ’ s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.	20.9515374539994
Two bar entrance, soldiers half price.	8.940527299955646
I could easy do a bunk on ma.	11.734783323643784
Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned.	25.03254937411223
That ’ s me in mourning.	18.464036467427213
When is it?	20.51754113714583
May the twentysecond.	17.630312280417076
Sure, the blooming thing is all over.	23.971831020119343
He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up.	20.22995619021963
Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers.	14.722716637442687
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.	13.66749651466234
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.	14.034527006126437
The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons.	9.258319102944256
One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man.	15.814167140240045
But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.	8.558242539621972
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff ’ s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.	18.41222404336515
No Sandymount tram.	16.871423653532485
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand.	13.699285826616757
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.	15.892318094041327
The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it.	15.174956064887544
He met schoolboys with satchels.	10.815511486161386
I ’ m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday.	9.43873685343511
He met other schoolboys.	13.370066512431826
Do they notice I ’ m in mourning?	15.439436609263643
Uncle Barney said he ’ d get it into the paper tonight.	20.646998760827934
Then they ’ ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa ’ s name.	18.516102313350828
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye.	16.925939256931105
The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.	15.684146924800656
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend.	15.425478232038728
A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking.	18.345925679410826
The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney ’ s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.	16.213022570867757
Never see him again.	18.65941110880629
Death, that is.	22.059865577276728
Pa is dead.	18.131833457233203
My father is dead.	16.047958929731216
He told me to be a good son to ma.	19.284667860747994
I couldn ’ t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better.	23.442527382976497
Poor pa.	23.912343304671865
That was Mr Dignam, my father.	21.452338718384866
I hope he ’ s in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.	12.872895530232196
* * * William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge.	8.854402651342214
In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.	10.830386856984289
D.	18.383350212219998
C.	14.373100099742409
in attendance.	13.574755080960543
The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays.	9.683702384173126
The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis.	14.056851137203818
At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar.	8.802205457406492
Between Queen ’ s and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley ’ s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B.	9.47333219207197
L., M.	19.38841792292959
A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M.	12.73935892649693
E.	17.860184031499212
White ’ s, the pawnbroker ’ s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus.	10.831919447571218
In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise.	10.49933442827094
Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King ’ s windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty.	10.981660124481085
From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan ’ s office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage.	7.499904103905537
Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy ’ s head by Miss Douce ’ s head watched and admired.	14.32758818075074
His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus ’ greeting.	11.425470606554736
From Cahill ’ s corner the reverend Hugh C.	14.77703686036861
Love, M.	17.600240754595482
A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons.	5.947187712958609
Passing by Roger Greene ’ s office and Dollard ’ s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby ’ s cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn ’ t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring ’ s big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant.	13.967688670619808
Beyond Lundy Foot ’ s from the shaded door of Kavanagh ’ s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland.	10.839733392809961
The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G.	7.287367543693761
C.	14.373100099742409
V.	42.08616501245889
O., passed Micky Anderson ’ s all times ticking watches and Henry and James ’ s wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, _dernier cri_ James.	10.3282720449863
Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade.	12.377521303763723
Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her.	14.535898388138293
A charming _soubrette, _ great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H.	8.501131389417196
G.	31.151366468604955
Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A.	18.65179392650426

Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently.	9.852156325198743
In Fownes ’ s street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal ’ s first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare.	9.585157288307812
John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it.	8.475372158487325
Where the foreleg of King Billy ’ s horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders.	12.576578606229743
She shouted in his ear the tidings.	19.198628725487005
Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage.	17.26229604410391
The honourable Gerald Ward A.	10.45380049663848
C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply.	9.896558848073393
At Ponsonby ’ s corner a jaded white flagon H.	10.468645298848548
halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, <URL>. ’ S, while outriders pranced past and carriages.	11.78188369298411
Opposite Pigott ’ s music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing & c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved.	7.25243445345714
By the provost ’ s wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of _My girl ’ s a Yorkshire <URL> Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders ’ skyblue frontlets and high action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigo serge.	10.160822629290678
His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red flower between his lips.	17.910489898633454
As they drove along Nassau street His Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music which was being discoursed in College park.	11.106531263495052
Unseen brazen highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the _cortège_: But though she ’ s a factory lass And wears no fancy clothes.	6.768675095316864
Baraabum.	35.97840067038581
Yet I ’ ve a sort of a Yorkshire relish for My little Yorkshire rose.	12.084346638300405

Begin! Bronze by gold, miss Douce ’ s head by miss Kennedy ’ s head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.	13.263883745997038
— Is that her?	16.947152587493676
asked miss Kennedy.	21.074269764307346
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de <URL> — Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.	11.622259810105765
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly: — Look at the fellow in the tall silk.	17.994329948682584
— Who?	12.787285610070553
Where?	20.307631490117476
gold asked more eagerly.	11.738692476300194
— In the second carriage, miss Douce ’ s wet lips said, laughing in the sun.	19.18745432861585
He ’ s looking.	17.769647556228577
She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.	13.534800946477459
Her wet lips tittered: — He ’ s killed looking back.	14.446405522529947
She laughed: — O wept! Aren ’ t men frightful idiots?	13.475763031948524
With sadness.	21.18074429005635
Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear.	8.450030806385271
Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.	14.037730767281984
Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.	8.916075911667926
— It ’ s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.	11.464781745773404
A man.	17.721743014066888
Bloowho went by by Moulang ’ s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine ’ s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll ’ s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.	14.687846745310118
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came.	17.848989713679654
And — There ’ s your teas, he said.	12.216804737666578
Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.	8.430641106478102
— What is it?	10.593475497978059
loud boots unmannerly asked.	11.551710309240056
— Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.	11.919548710522298
— Your _beau, _ is it?	14.472025089579297
A haughty bronze replied: — I ’ ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.	12.77257760999223
Bloom.	18.279381378412623
On her flower frowning miss Douce said: — Most aggravating that young brat is.	10.227817817413964
If he doesn ’ t conduct himself I ’ ll wring his ear for him a yard long.	13.942345327935463
Ladylike in exquisite contrast.	13.03284355252859
— Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.	12.31745136196064
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea.	23.871956697213662
They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw.	8.813538267644553
They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.	13.429704047703547
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.	10.38626730110849
— Am I awfully sunburnt?	11.44278473164654
Miss bronze unbloused her neck.	11.915826021911569
It gets brown after.	14.04701957504275
Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?	12.29170399063604
— And leave it to my hands, she said.	16.90874829343224
— Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.	16.36184878692208
Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce — Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated.	9.301089988835162
I asked that old fogey in Boyd ’ s for something for my skin.	15.844329889602305
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed: — O, don ’ t remind me of him for mercy ’ sake! — But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.	13.382403913998727
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.	9.39167986095361
— No, don ’ t, she cried.	14.710814467617853
— I won ’ t listen, she cried.	14.16602923396985
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey ’ s tone: — For your what?	12.224065071061766
says he.	15.700326219745547
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again: — Don ’ t let me think of him or I ’ ll expire.	19.0563783413772
The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.	13.07470230071485
She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.	10.61991852042302
— Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings.	10.575225736705908
Hufa! Hufa! Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy ’ s throat.	10.646634091194036
Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.	7.392003349069746
— O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried.	11.79716223926357
Will you ever forget his goggle eye?	13.111118455874612
Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting: — And your other eye! Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner ’ s name.	9.238389593473665
Why do I always think Figather?	16.7854637935602
Gathering figs, I think.	17.059054946436525
And Prosper Loré ’ s huguenot name.	14.85275311954126
By Bassi ’ s blessed virgins Bloom ’ s dark eyes went by.	18.88041484936622
Bluerobed, white under, come to me.	20.153853786667344
God they believe she is: or goddess.	18.605432866225396
Those today.	22.630506065968287
I could not see.	18.153525139662694
That fellow spoke.	17.93519390129419
A student.	23.09119059221067
After with Dedalus ’ son.	13.972691872930966
He might be Mulligan.	20.585571401080788
All comely virgins.	15.847979341928639
That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.	10.887483976804974
By went his eyes.	15.914524338280422
The sweets of sin.	11.108458457833295
Sweet are the sweets.	21.322007695715946
Of sin.	23.27399059890588
In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye.	6.497868223457119
They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.	11.845953500577975
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.	9.693847674570792
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled.	9.830190290781516
Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying: — O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.	10.409291436155616
With his bit of beard! Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.	10.758309046003616
— Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.	16.95830116754297
Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter.	9.412277594603086
And then laughed more.	14.020794587039408
Greasy I knows.	19.326999438724332
Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge.	7.5681560375101515
All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.	17.759197805670006
Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.	29.410325048574524
— O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose.	11.306992422110955
I wished I hadn ’ t laughed so much.	15.440334489353516
I feel all wet.	16.891947018927446
— O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested.	12.290561726085887
You horrid thing! And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.	13.437022261862346
By Cantwell ’ s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi ’ s virgins, bright of their oils.	15.055468995823244
Nannetti ’ s father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I.	12.450257725280132
Religion pays.	23.142614876728047
Must see him for that par.	26.088750676490278
Eat first.	23.790437319382942
I want.	19.643628445271503
Not yet.	18.254182835899393
At four, she said.	14.372880209330557
Time ever passing.	17.375510633093967
Clockhands turning.	23.739977041292555
On. Where eat?	14.900580179090548
The Clarence, Dolphin.	13.769820085125797
On. For Raoul.	13.03056953264191
Eat.	41.13662151318119
If I net five guineas with those ads.	10.658258385413822
The violet silk petticoats.	15.438523742812373
Not yet.	18.254182835899393
The sweets of sin.	11.108458457833295
Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.	11.31391369202233
Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus.	12.66183597768049
Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails.	12.863168390081148
He strolled.	21.396302755362008
— O, welcome back, miss Douce.	15.639380487023544
He held her hand.	15.949724304900766
Enjoyed her holidays?	15.858150820302534
— Tiptop.	19.679352126640836
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.	11.383663862326399
— Gorgeous, she said.	11.867072167120574
Lying out on the strand all day.	21.578807438407722
Bronze whiteness.	21.519122748846247
— That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently.	14.939031697313588
Tempting poor simple males.	12.977637633525237
Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.	8.72449308704403
— O go away! she said.	12.199630680277233
You ’ re very simple, I don ’ t think.	13.28412656072352
He was.	16.161338921075917
— Well now I am, he mused.	22.26157486728039
I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.	12.942895475327452
— You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer.	10.126646827955998
And what did the doctor order today?	16.3765216551902
— Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself.	15.974016740914644
I think I ’ ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.	17.41884791945121
Jingle.	31.64262872920851
— With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.	11.934117676016044
With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s she turned herself.	11.816663425302949
With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg.	9.691270194849276
Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe.	19.31970747527488
Alacrity she served.	16.56571759005101
He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.	10.590212687815738
— By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains.	16.982397702516156
Must be a great tonic in the air down there.	19.668968528268902
But a long threatening comes at last, they say.	14.31805937267913
Yes.	14.82237916275066
Yes.	14.82237916275066
Yes.	14.82237916275066
He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid ’ s, into the bowl.	18.54041608010174
Chips.	43.669601723859934
Shreds.	44.876532221709276
Musing.	44.876532221709276
Mute.	49.9750299142878
None nought said nothing.	14.859884431347693
Yes.	14.82237916275066
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling: — _O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas! _ — Was Mr Lidwell in today?	13.486664264478323
In came Lenehan.	17.587998452154597
Round him peered Lenehan.	13.646487450205884
Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge.	11.642343583946788
Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex.	11.655974473925282
To Martha I must write.	18.761285900226905
Buy paper.	22.995020755142182
Daly ’ s.	21.513876026067546
Girl there civil.	17.870405921434635
Bloom.	18.279381378412623
Old Bloom.	21.196154776355062
Blue bloom is on the rye.	19.14046979777512
— He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.	11.283816864218249
Lenehan came forward.	24.125397196744196
— Was Mr Boylan looking for me?	17.47611782489397
He asked.	18.23667869731919
She answered: — Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?	20.58495152581704
She asked.	19.47285310426645
Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page: — No. He was not.	21.92924756930053
Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.	11.959710051638876
— Peep! Who ’ s in the corner?	20.299558079532474
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures.	10.268864146708019
To mind her stops.	14.142594568553575
To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.	9.89500410181903
Jingle jaunty jingle.	15.164884090114871
Girlgold she read and did not glance.	18.57130183096767
Take no notice.	19.023179556496665
She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly: — Ah fox met ah stork.	9.249697702641178
Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?	6.86519435422256
He droned in vain.	12.423854220449343
Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.	21.21502039522554
He sighed aside: — Ah me! O my! He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.	18.345243084248878
— Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.	21.449758296089886
— Who may he be?	11.999614120048061
Mr Dedalus asked.	12.277348434955702
Lenehan opened most genial arms.	11.952925304863522
Who?	23.95062567534216
— Who may he be?	11.999614120048061
he asked.	10.295735601437203
Can you ask?	23.205812684685952
Dry.	44.876532221709276
Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.	12.940470594646282
— I see, he said.	11.55028799777933
I didn ’ t recognise him for the moment.	15.829758242463047
I hear he is keeping very select company.	13.031119544178347
Have you seen him lately?	14.653242232597604
He had.	19.049770228935028
— I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.	14.870683160921836
He smiled at bronze ’ s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes: — The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips.	14.037397211358952
The ponderous pundit, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin ’ s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O ’ Madden Burke.	11.583126766695868
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and — That must have been highly diverting, said he.	13.235121586205098
I see.	15.5305652366756
He see.	21.468150986335704
He drank.	19.86119959599092
With faraway mourning mountain eye.	10.727383827580509
Set down his glass.	21.282342197378096
— I see you have moved the piano.	16.13512821444363
— The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.	14.038724362094447
— Is that a fact?	12.259471496257484
— Didn ’ t he, miss Kennedy?	23.197714559750725
The real classical, you know.	14.451212623905352
Not twenty I ’ m sure he was.	16.430911703197147
— Is that a fact?	12.259471496257484
Mr Dedalus said.	8.43077714347946
He drank and strayed away.	11.0903750095165
— So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.	16.060720960629382
God ’ s curse on bitch ’ s bastard.	17.592782162805925
Tink to her pity cried a diner ’ s bell.	17.201829213164803
To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond.	11.659270413323469
Lager for diner.	17.94820908899649
Lager without alacrity she served.	10.731846193875805
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.	9.888253616952788
Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires.	13.599237072909734
He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.	12.976205284299976
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely ’ s wise Bloom in Daly ’ s Henry Flower bought.	10.843495368558443
Are you not happy in your home?	13.852193720633856
Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo.	16.058343971932135
Means something, language of flow.	14.508833450525438
Was it a daisy?	18.212297968288446
Innocence that is.	21.17478822169636
Respectable girl meet after mass.	11.513197569582426
Thanks awfully muchly.	15.241451333518905
Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.	12.670990550630927
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all.	9.358920599048957
Hair streaming: lovelorn.	11.917157286044095
For some man.	20.161307321748314
For Raoul.	19.315418623709714
He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car.	9.77869761432138
It is.	14.278055319776016
Again.	35.02297700348629
Coincidence.	32.20978324985897
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.	10.791719677009656
Follow.	44.25662045647404
Risk it.	23.98937307525098
Go quick.	24.895868701541882
At four.	18.724640256750224
Near now.	22.818365210106926
Out.	30.186877980577535
— Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.	15.524350519781358
— Aha...	16.308207076943305
I was forgetting...	14.289936830848916
Excuse...	19.5285015582177
— And four.	17.039781984291995
At four she.	15.307165955081981
Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled.	11.127672695238257
Bloo smi qui go.	11.583892530673383
Ternoon.	44.876532221709276
Think you ’ re the only pebble on the beach?	19.237626593787873
For men.	24.73596382523304
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.	13.708189391358932
From the saloon a call came, long in dying.	11.367621398981402
That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck.	18.830815061461358
A call again.	16.812845374414337
That he now poised that it now throbbed.	15.453724325552479
You hear?	23.735378958809616
It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs.	7.258911307504554
Longer in dying call.	15.376260328560463
Pat paid for diner ’ s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss Douce.	11.331644000223974
— _The bright stars fade_...	10.244479373910151
A voiceless song sang from within, singing: —...	10.338974534367026
_the morn is <URL> A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands.	6.832129367317528
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love ’ s leavetaking, life ’ s, love ’ s morn.	16.87504250199456
— _The dewdrops pearl_...	9.009881968632156
Lenehan ’ s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.	15.159284993078591
— But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.	14.759554643376248
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.	15.481652192402168
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.	7.3674370020137525
— Did she fall or was she pushed?	12.267280977663608
he asked her.	15.064884928626707
She answered, slighting: — Ask no questions and you ’ ll hear no lies.	12.852678486923272
Like lady, ladylike.	17.941536702927785
Blazes Boylan ’ s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.	14.152038835201205
Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar.	14.361299467711254
Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him: — See the conquering hero comes.	13.019057287950645
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero.	13.655139605248976
See me he might.	23.81729625515012
The seat he sat on: warm.	15.971640662995908
Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding ’ s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.	10.739693726209996
— _And I from thee_...	9.26585738257942
— I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.	17.809142873642926
He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw.	12.403718296199848
She smiled on him.	20.020237756658684
But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.	16.91623740177976
Smart Boylan bespoke potions.	11.126072276072286
— What ’ s your cry?	14.526457587914035
Glass of bitter?	18.31152334949842
Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me.	15.054768382691176
Not yet.	18.254182835899393
At four she.	15.307165955081981
Who said four?	19.591476716063216
Cowley ’ s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff ’ s office.	18.391125385345003
Avoid.	44.876532221709276
Goulding a chance.	19.601265399353064
What is he doing in the Ormond?	23.55555409164137
Car waiting.	24.25045677992176
Wait.	16.144754643793675
Hello.	26.268180599479532
Where off to?	24.138330659185215
Something to eat?	21.7644012653442
I too was just.	24.142986443445942
In here.	21.64415472248411
What, Ormond?	15.519110306365567
Best value in Dublin.	15.072205425935554
Is that so?	20.06681328913239
Diningroom.	44.876532221709276
Sit tight there.	17.21443260732693
See, not be seen.	28.74657678527312
I think I ’ ll join you.	15.617814158200524
Come on.	19.227485892247252
Richie led on.	22.251919349025542
Bloom followed bag.	18.917368123277665
Dinner fit for a prince.	24.64971261191931
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.	12.609516543667295
— O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch.	12.051388228047028
— Why don ’ t you grow?	14.623198516042608
asked Blazes Boylan.	16.55425907009343
That is to say she.	22.462114324659336
Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.	9.810773157665581
He pitched a broad coin down.	10.618457571964173
Coin rang.	19.588406916750532
— Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...	19.403230601386422
— Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.	12.802255064342624
— Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.	13.596944376282373
— I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking.	11.976398987252468
Not on my own, you know.	21.711193428611896
Fancy of a friend of mine.	23.115886145533906
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce ’ s lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.	13.39128087089158
Idolores.	48.68688643141149
The eastern seas.	16.662324425696788
Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray.	11.516775080074044
Clock clacked.	15.600877012202146
Miss Douce took Boylan ’ s coin, struck boldly the cashregister.	11.290291825098745
It clanged.	22.328523246875722
Clock clacked.	15.600877012202146
Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change.	12.254147858058827
Look to the west.	36.17392576407157
A clack.	22.408282809882227
For me.	21.70686601193226
— What time is that?	15.65455049910233
asked Blazes Boylan.	16.55425907009343
Four?	47.48710484879157
O ’ clock.	19.730201329044057
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan ’ s elbowsleeve.	9.47613250977262
— Let ’ s hear the time, he said.	19.62368475968719
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.	7.498808086667454
Be near.	24.178065493516975
At four.	18.724640256750224
Has he forgotten?	17.84062210535486
Perhaps a trick.	17.130665747152992
Not come: whet appetite.	9.947927847989941
I couldn ’ t do.	15.663803163660324
Wait, wait.	18.318952630636204
Pat, waiter, waited.	12.291296489856554
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure ’ s skyblue bow and eyes.	11.383500160744832
— Go on, pressed Lenehan.	13.656035967924383
There ’ s no - one.	12.979023756512763
He never heard.	21.633615101624745
—...	8.070682464843227
_to Flora ’ s lips did <URL> High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.	16.85548267797346
Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes Boylan ’ s flower and eyes.	11.691314190445187
— Please, please.	14.542936361322777
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.	7.792294393694346
— _I could not leave thee_...	12.266723911119819
— Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.	10.32457152798946
— No, now, urged Lenehan.	15.925555855901207
_Sonnez la cloche! _ O do! There ’ s no - one.	13.571004872451383
She looked.	22.601617021901788
Quick.	32.35443626726641
Miss Kenn out of earshot.	22.001204536050803
Sudden bent.	24.22185359179302
Two kindling faces watched her bend.	10.514908039208095
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.	18.61471473921868
— Go on! Do! _Sonnez! _ Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee.	10.930079731167485
Delayed.	44.876532221709276
Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.	12.382132438269554
_ — Sonnez! _ Smack.	19.149119208489406
She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman ’ s warmhosed thigh.	7.286614691669931
— _La cloche! _ cried gleeful Lenehan.	11.823286669928128
Trained by owner.	15.904630615279444
No sawdust there.	16.78074015568866
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren ’ t men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.	9.815230241240945
— You ’ re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.	9.144169374006514
Boylan, eyed, eyed.	17.84271450546367
Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops.	8.450669911575377
His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.	8.593037262382147
Yes, bronze from anearby.	14.074534356157974
—...	8.070682464843227
_Sweetheart, goodbye! _ — I ’ m off, said Boylan with impatience.	16.375335497563917
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.	10.220234476635556
— Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly.	12.185368713524282
I wanted to tell you.	16.65194180184658
Tom Rochford...	14.306991185395946
— Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.	16.593160767416325
Lenehan gulped to go.	15.581902218341149
— Got the horn or what?	13.931515293050559
he said.	10.465399985534118
Wait.	16.144754643793675
I ’ m coming.	12.98115511589484
— How do you do, Mr Dollard?	18.281306667287787
— Eh?	17.76306839242804
How do?	20.44447292262043
How do?	20.44447292262043
Ben Dollard ’ s vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley ’ s woe.	15.591694309712766
He won ’ t give you any trouble, Bob.	15.575287151802549
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow.	21.141899808379964
We ’ ll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot ’ s ear this time.	14.913718804697876
Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.	17.187649459761722
— Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily.	12.503092310160255
Come on, Simon.	17.520736792005298
Give us a ditty.	15.625127336653442
We heard the piano.	21.09441488161066
Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders.	8.758620880576006
Power for Richie.	20.845760366255583
And Bloom?	24.433605829775214
Let me see.	14.11989776264136
Not make him walk twice.	16.8022722184842
His corns.	24.326115408470255
Four now.	24.110004761817184
How warm this black is.	12.161850821681032
Course nerves a bit.	16.415668585785134
Refracts (is it?) heat.	17.801365687228476
Let me see.	14.11989776264136
Cider.	44.25662045647404
Yes, bottle of cider.	14.91099791666382
— What ’ s that?	11.872792500682896
Mr Dedalus said.	8.43077714347946
— Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called.	16.729868026161505
Begone dull care.	17.922152721372694
Come, Bob.	21.48760618346124
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon.	12.143758166764448
He plumped him Dollard on the stool.	15.398635230271198
Plumped, stopped abrupt.	14.091323039990122
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning.	13.134561017201666
Bothered, he wanted Power and cider.	20.75626232325815
Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.	16.698558673350348
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.	12.398216287620276
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound.	18.740263946236862
He ’ s off.	16.40017253539255
Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.	12.298825710867604
Jingling.	43.11253835167618
He ’ s gone.	13.039218333660719
Jingle.	31.64262872920851
Hear.	45.74910187899788
— Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.	10.143025734917103
God be with old times.	22.36408624131752
Miss Douce ’ s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight.	13.68102278145033
Gone.	25.591004547417455
Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord.	15.642218441704964
She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, _eau de <URL> — Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them.	9.667492227741578
There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.	12.274776656881087
There was.	19.129548852104172
— A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.	12.635263664725695
The devil wouldn ’ t stop him.	15.408770803810164
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.	15.93566238804245
— God, do you remember?	23.328293802093093
Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard.	18.420148589487415
And by Japers I had no wedding garment.	12.662725207329485
They laughed all three.	15.5670055637798
He had no wed.	17.477042239005314
All trio laughed.	13.933780922795188
No wedding garment.	15.494602050093336
— Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said.	11.453132879551136
Where ’ s my pipe, by the way?	19.33718076090686
He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe.	21.45741514751496
Bald Pat carried two diners ’ drinks, Richie and Poldy.	8.653626271268045
And Father Cowley laughed again.	16.526662168405363
— I saved the situation, Ben, I think.	13.777514540182496
— You did, averred Ben Dollard.	12.273715008709521
I remember those tight trousers too.	11.464439983149413
That was a brilliant idea, Bob.	17.320634985333697
Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes.	12.924107321900483
He saved the situa.	13.528935402522775
Tight trou.	19.698716063512254
Brilliant ide.	19.698768402221454
— I knew he was on the rocks, he said.	16.87972000750146
The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business?	16.490159206695488
Do you remember?	16.723581198436648
We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh ’ s gave us the number.	17.05849073991912
Remember?	43.729632344856505
Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.	18.430697430190158
— By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.	11.796900902760617
Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.	13.28242907287591
— Merrion square style.	14.508366392001529
Balldresses, by God, and court dresses.	23.22608145612836
He wouldn ’ t take any money either.	13.585553349839856
What?	14.617951109062046
Any God ’ s quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose.	10.932865398808614
— Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded.	11.952073248412004
Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.	13.339514435580925
Jingle jaunted down the quays.	20.006884319032967

You ’ re the warrior.	11.210947595505807
— So I am, Ben Warrior laughed.	16.34539071184537
I was thinking of your landlord.	20.79111057374494
Love or money.	18.38021000196423
He stopped.	19.058083765489513
He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.	9.84980515097996
— Sure, you ’ d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.	13.550192933169628
In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard.	11.170170550890669
He would.	21.539305883676043
— Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added.	10.73087477159494
Half time, Ben.	28.016653107569283
_Amoroso ma non <URL> Let me there.	13.262370237872904
Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout.	8.692685244785668

It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather.	19.013183865778544
They drank cool stout.	12.90872671123737
Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going?	18.07507266954715
And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring.	9.666606505186516
No, she couldn ’ t say.	18.440463149247826
But it would be in the paper.	22.05978346035124
O, she need not trouble.	19.06955884772825
She waved about her outspread _Independent, _ searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten.	11.732529083000584

Trousers tight as a drum on him.	16.96009482607194
Musical porkers.	19.698747466654336

Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking.	12.942259097976676
With all his belongings on show.	12.348586838880868

Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long arms outheld.	9.824305175564426
Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly.	16.09419936471646

Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting, touched the obedient keys.	12.632837889226279

By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a lady ’ s grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous _eau de Nil_ Mina to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.	9.333181331679787
The harping chords of prelude closed.	9.845264117018651

Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine.	6.989510150020564
Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar.	14.708624092525815
So. That will do.	14.55619984898709
Pat, waiter, waited, waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.	17.19420391842065

Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to from both depart when first they heard.	10.725469414942642
When first they saw, lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn ’ t expect it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.	13.803649988379801
Love that is singing: love ’ s old sweet song.	15.15645121924705
Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet.	14.903657832786816
Love ’ s old sweet _sonnez la_ gold.	11.892376682052792
Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.	9.167492986353336

Hands felt for the opulent.	20.662427732458294
Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.	12.246147734908885

I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.	11.916000563378255

Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?	13.675567437253711

Who ’ s the old ballocks you were talking to?	19.38379341121922
— Old Troy, says I, was in the force.	23.86582348889939
— What are you doing round those parts?	12.377298097989598
says Joe.	10.239310108916836

A bit off the top.	25.226620628899404

— Who?	12.787285610070553
says I.	15.317749111486599
Sure, he ’ s out in John of God ’ s off his head, poor man.	24.48410287776454
— Drinking his own stuff?	18.910832377225578
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
— Ay, says I.	10.026103971084826
Whisky and water on the brain.	26.94347823974283

I want to see the citizen.	16.17841176520942
— Barney mavourneen ’ s be it, says I.	16.67785264335714
Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?	13.882118625339988
— Not a word, says Joe.	14.659866428925772
I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.	20.2039857145019
— What was that, Joe?	23.3807713920633
says I.	15.317749111486599
— Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease.	12.96367500552223
I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.	13.034554964569791
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another.	18.00498391283392
Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it.	19.725543512309308
Jesus, I couldn ’ t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber.	18.53852911313778
For trading without a licence, says he.	12.516584345900192
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan.	13.897228180852741
There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar.	10.578498062642714
There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown.	8.911543510385748
A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated.	14.898224154917429
In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied.	11.863301342485633
Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects.	7.345307936523686
And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan ’ s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.	11.800882472632622
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O ’ Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains.	7.559020115636074
Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.	5.208794251525823
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.	19.82189475572322
Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber! And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffe ’ s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M ’ Gillicuddy ’ s reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer ’ s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.	6.471876143662347
So we turned into Barney Kiernan ’ s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.	18.32623395082796
— There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.	16.106064469584442
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.	14.793731936370104
Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog.	13.93973005025262
I ’ m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.	16.702077936839448
— Stand and deliver, says he.	10.784013111963407
— That ’ s all right, citizen, says Joe.	11.108780851482361
Friends here.	24.65675457458942
— Pass, friends, says he.	12.760500644523848
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he: — What ’ s your opinion of the times?	21.117541885481746
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill.	15.094628460153219
But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.	16.748417886661475
— I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.	15.67472822116242
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says: — Foreign wars is the cause of it.	17.992706133456807
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket: — It ’ s the Russians wish to tyrannise.	14.05958322082324
— Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I.	9.836332503525183
I ’ ve a thirst on me I wouldn ’ t sell for half a crown.	11.426456046215424
— Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.	16.080017930513367
— Wine of the country, says he.	21.141704616972174
— What ’ s yours?	16.387412511898578
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
— Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.	10.117084812909647
— Three pints, Terry, says Joe.	9.529315085842795
And how ’ s the old heart, citizen?	25.220416249930484
says he.	15.700326219745547
— Never better, _a chara_, says he.	9.525436178305817
What Garry?	22.695412809443535
Are we going to win?	20.47857260051194
Eh?	23.62115905831347
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.	24.647367559126323
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero.	7.108004946824936
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).	8.768991576433937
The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest.	8.772951742611594
The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower.	19.511024602665838
A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.	10.512421181525411
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes.	9.975396338850633
Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut.	6.64718427724392
His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast.	8.54621349346264
From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O ’ Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O ’ Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O ’ Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M ’ Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.	5.556675311429252

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.	8.034797980799329
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid.	11.567379732301001
O, as true as I ’ m telling you.	17.783121049445242
A goodlooking sovereign.	16.65948464648285
— And there ’ s more where that came from, says he.	13.895882662087754
— Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe?	10.071155376579622
says I.	15.317749111486599
— Sweat of my brow, says Joe.	13.764744577940316
’ Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.	9.923328651152842
— I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod ’ s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.	15.796860937788223
Who comes through Michan ’ s land, bedight in sable armour?	11.493155292568565
O ’ Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he.	21.490677256948935
Impervious to fear is Rory ’ s son: he of the prudent soul.	17.348440699805618
— For the old woman of Prince ’ s street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ.	17.42725614819727
The pledgebound party on the floor of the house.	18.666786241614158
And look at this blasted rag, says he.	13.512927740758306
_The Irish Independent, _ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman ’ s friend.	14.344352084011637
Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland Independent, _ and I ’ ll thank you and the marriages.	20.21330021050615
And he starts reading them out: — Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne ’ s on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son.	10.781020725688041
How ’ s that, eh?	17.453313672493824
Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, <NUM> Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude ’ s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester.	7.674622207083452
Eh?	23.62115905831347
Deaths.	44.876532221709276
Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...	9.046663092023552
— I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.	17.25296881909211
— Cockburn.	22.236884043931635
Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June <NUM>, at <NUM> Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen.	9.575118767473375
How ’ s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How ’ s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?	17.34368940921646
— Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose.	14.715483050360232
Thanks be to God they had the start of us.	16.501017034326235
Drink that, citizen.	24.636788748566847
— I will, says he, honourable person.	14.60157473441205
— Health, Joe, says I.	12.073804173815578
And all down the form.	24.607188220915898
Ah! Ow! Don ’ t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.	17.6651056352378
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.	17.290369152445283
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.	11.129499761109967
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney ’ s snug, squeezed up with the laughing.	12.99474618223015
And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn ’ t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran.	16.526856174911277
I didn ’ t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door.	14.390455688035447
And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle.	13.109023373958033
I thought Alf would split.	13.535908552679347
— Look at him, says he.	15.630684663586807
Breen.	47.27046746333398
He ’ s traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U.	15.372784972513621
p: up on it to take a li...	18.708753335659097
And he doubled up.	14.24281361500744
— Take a what?	14.840517033259756
says I.	15.317749111486599
— Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.	14.55625541509429
— O hell! says I.	14.431677119013502
The bloody mongrel began to growl that ’ d put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.	18.300256997567608
_ — Bi i dho husht, _ says he.	8.236169871443305
— Who?	12.787285610070553
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
— Breen, says Alf.	16.353918983995335
He was in John Henry Menton ’ s and then he went round to Collis and Ward ’ s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff ’ s for a lark.	18.746777667353502
O God, I ’ ve a pain laughing.	16.224897953217344
U.	20.136332872350966
p: up.	11.441832688442634
The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.	15.508192277581246
— When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy?	15.335253282527706
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
— Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up.	13.521533115225399
Is that Alf Bergan?	15.799900135383641
— Yes, says Alf.	9.706218844834487
Hanging?	46.42780436454657
Wait till I show you.	13.791788717737807
That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds.	12.52791800257978
You should have seen long John ’ s eye.	19.29128467063599
U.	20.136332872350966
p....	15.82694107875913
— Who are you laughing at?	14.74541653817742
says Bob Doran.	13.5467287565149
Is that Bergan?	18.14949969467131
— Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.	15.213335527466931
Terence O ’ Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda.	10.686540418874388
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.	9.32922468179549
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.	15.892991941547233
But he, the young chief of the O ’ Bergan ’ s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze.	10.618543164505729
Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.	14.470384684135812
— What ’ s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?	11.752448531091783
— What ’ s that?	11.872792500682896
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
— Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino.	12.835697742253231
Talking about hanging, I ’ ll show you something you never saw.	14.170511087892637
Hangmen ’ s letters.	36.19764176640282
Look at here.	15.129753491627019
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.	13.030519445656974
— Are you codding?	13.375541242386753
says I.	15.317749111486599
— Honest injun, says Alf.	10.452437237661144
Read them.	24.045195706893733
So Joe took up the letters.	18.51657328860751
— Who are you laughing at?	14.74541653817742
says Bob Doran.	13.5467287565149
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust.	24.335928124576707
Bob ’ s a queer chap when the porter ’ s up in him so says I just to make talk: — How ’ s Willy Murray those times, Alf?	23.34232454169769
— I don ’ t know, says Alf.	11.456546662813453
Only I was running after that...	21.34803724801245
— You what?	16.444633372581663
says Joe, throwing down the letters.	17.466171907991132
With who?	27.408487810376865
— With Dignam, says Alf.	15.208027580093313
— Is it Paddy?	16.174582818559834
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
— Yes, says Alf.	9.706218844834487
Why?	18.457368458488407
— Don ’ t you know he ’ s dead?	15.028853772199794
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
— Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.	12.1185573445206
— Ay, says Joe.	8.346430771666771
— Sure I ’ m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.	15.129578825251976
— Who ’ s dead?	16.62624410298349
says Bob Doran.	13.5467287565149
— You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.	14.388693907870005
— What?	11.778589598318154
says Alf.	13.312592435631608
Good Christ, only five...	17.47993266952696
What?...	11.633389109010762
And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim ’ s...	17.984198435474905
What?	14.617951109062046
Dignam dead?	31.345244155941895
— What about Dignam?	17.18801743376094
says Bob Doran.	13.5467287565149
Who ’ s talking about...?	22.12069563488853
— Dead! says Alf.	11.898347123334137
He ’ s no more dead than you are.	14.878078475584813
— Maybe so, says Joe.	12.468223294391535
They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.	12.61776745415831
— Paddy?	24.726921589798014
says Alf.	13.312592435631608
— Ay, says Joe.	8.346430771666771
He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.	11.041470467008027
— Good Christ! says Alf.	10.41387598278656
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.	23.5779640474632
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face.	10.5521561251615
Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.	10.034907795832725
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels.	13.080060114641539
In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.	15.604379114953682
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.	9.175141763363905
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief.	7.234383752448444
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.	11.127584465123212
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body.	17.14756211582528
Mind C.	23.60139271954188
K.	25.84694560870483
doesn ’ t pile it <URL> It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.	12.778157008480651
J.	9.525932994442917
O ’ Neill ’ s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements.	18.5088243306131
Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen ’ s to be soled only as the heels were still good.	17.02765126865001
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.	11.35020217309042
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.	17.51078332215865
He is gone from mortal haunts: O ’ Dignam, sun of our morning.	13.993709860076745
Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow.	19.49719130904784
Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.	17.414799289653015
— There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.	13.45418421028863
— Who?	12.787285610070553
— Bloom, says he.	16.658479012254173
He ’ s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.	14.538576988249096
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.	12.916394694903536
Little Alf was knocked bawways.	12.462034672069347
Faith, he was.	24.464167102536457
— Good Christ! says he.	12.44259074562774
I could have sworn it was him.	16.252898019282224
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he ’ s under the influence: — Who said Christ is good?	18.159807370894118
— I beg your parsnips, says Alf.	9.566967681916655
— Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?	16.350056104932893
— Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.	15.892716289874867
He ’ s over all his troubles.	18.773697376913844
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.	14.050418732477398
— He ’ s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.	16.035703625877495
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn ’ t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.	17.35961110897356
And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you ’ re there.	12.926928519422205
— The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.	16.175916411426865
Talking through his bloody hat.	19.711962569284065
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff ’ s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	15.144467009536953
— The noblest, the truest, says he.	15.86840814924657
And he ’ s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.	14.713047897937495
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.	12.316661107247233
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.	14.05200096840841
— Come in, come on, he won ’ t eat you, says the citizen.	17.630795105311694
So Bloom slopes in with his cod ’ s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.	16.27542532974174
— O, Christ M ’ Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters.	16.26123850693194
Listen to this, will you?	20.03680474864113
And he starts reading out one.	12.02410628677286
_<NUM> Hunter Street, <URL> _To the High Sheriff of Dublin, <URL> _Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the <NUM> of Febuary <NUM> and i hanged... _ — Show us, Joe, says I.	9.85581087603538
private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when... _ — Jesus, says I.	7.57499663365503
— _...	10.298354536063062
Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith... _ The citizen made a grab at the letter.	14.079350068323862
— Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can ’ t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five <URL> _H.	10.897767569283603
Rumbold, Master <URL> — And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.	12.97744462930351
— And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe.	15.15778107285654
Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf.	22.869595322278826
Gob, he ’ s a prudent member and no mistake.	13.66600109440653
— Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.	10.551220424651298
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.	15.335558693936482
— They ’ re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.	12.966717332212012
And he was telling us there ’ s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.	11.030250061812822
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor.	17.838588353717576
Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.	7.62068578017079
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I ’ m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don ’ t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.	13.754906953667986
— There ’ s one thing it hasn ’ t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.	11.559134042117634
— What ’ s that?	11.872792500682896
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
— The poor bugger ’ s tool that ’ s being hanged, says Alf.	15.05038561279967
— That so?	13.53697205495797
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
— God ’ s truth, says Alf.	17.244858832910705
I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible.	19.24099509877339
He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.	24.99290057755177
— Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.	14.367869814692531
— That can be explained by science, says Bloom.	13.133493838547611
It ’ s only a natural phenomenon, don ’ t you see, because on account of the...	12.004439415242322
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.	14.91316708738498
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem <URL> So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other.	11.26874203461787
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought.	17.252254714691357
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs.	8.816347933756301
And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get.	16.403706825879393
Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs ’ tin he told Terry to bring.	14.229695896535576
Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more.	17.38253148680461
Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.	13.10356331590477
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she ’ s far from the land.	11.56074696852417
And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.	14.605480964145109
Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.	20.031518792753722
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk.	16.186838970038465
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.	13.127744755744338
And Bloom with his _but don ’ t you see? _ and _but on the other hand_.	17.565040685960685
And sure, more be token, the lout I ’ m told was in Power ’ s after, the blender ’ s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment.	17.302908876574076
Phenomenon! — The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.	16.179626330634555
— Ay, ay, says Joe.	8.787143053297923
— You don ’ t grasp my point, says Bloom.	12.372286460434877
What I mean is...	18.510152676278395
— _Sinn Fein! _ says the citizen.	13.68225240457371
_Sinn Fein amhain! _ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.	11.99864308626329
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.	15.025953883872821
The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.	8.594907993219726
A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons.	12.071508422667025
A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza ’ s plaintive muse.	7.858688566373999
Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L - n - h - n and M - ll - g - n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth - provoking fashion.	6.715958485400621
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies.	8.815519099078847
The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day ’ s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.	10.35963304003239
The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.	8.987828042247624
The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad - Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.	8.388312054780355
Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Señor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli - Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein.	2.83801325448771
All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness.	8.810564906307524
An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F.	10.514197298509979
O.	16.57850871695433
T.	20.980755442869455
E.	17.860184031499212
I.	12.415755957110475
as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland ’ s patron saint.	14.813777151425217
In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged.	5.576753778367736
The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties.	6.956022188578091
The readywitted ninefooter ’ s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted.	14.493209413627326
Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.	11.63041220310806
O.	16.57850871695433
T.	20.980755442869455
E.	17.860184031499212
I., several of whom were bleeding profusely.	11.085030947410978
Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses.	11.955929034520006
The objects (which included several hundred ladies ’ and gentlemen ’ s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.	9.196295914817984
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus Cruentus_.	9.992641988015984
He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate — short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man.	7.787390159200411
The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.	7.677986890551192
It was exactly seventeen o ’ clock.	9.794089788613164
The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore ’ s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi.	11.755617486488601
The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.	11.486245823049542
Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously.	12.634987895743803
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.	7.822545248237864
On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim.	7.548983530585706
The housesteward of the amalgamated cats ’ and dogs ’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.	8.960604472174138
Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers ’ association as a token of his regard and esteem.	10.194078328473255
The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake.	10.968575160699853
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.	9.091745694588537
Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach.	10.571697907597644
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.	14.831586710905448
She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment.	14.147819215885324
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time.	12.905484348256461
A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself.	9.796882918029688
Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage.	15.739315789697075
Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion ’ s history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.	12.588195895606603
Nay, even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin - Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.	9.786535514830085
With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage, _ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone: — God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.	10.583133026971119
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can ’ t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.	16.043571187158978
Antitreating is about the size of it.	18.55298994834604
Gob, he ’ d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you ’ d ever see the froth of his pint.	17.002906018452318
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don ’ t be talking.	10.859518816114912
Ireland sober is Ireland free.	12.29561830809665
And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.	13.79677305951489
And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.	10.221180816348612
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me.	13.811576632838356
I ’ d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog.	16.88868403127809
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn ’ t blind him.	12.595010610370835
— Afraid he ’ ll bite you?	17.22323353757146
says the citizen, jeering.	12.551933897703991
— No, says I.	12.632738143451837
But he might take my leg for a lamppost.	18.87653831550883
So he calls the old dog over.	18.943819485306296
— What ’ s on you, Garry?	16.567282053531816
says he.	15.700326219745547
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.	16.10562435517194
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.	14.805608728884534
Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that.	15.54319637687153
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.	18.738244523533247
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry.	9.47365891776242
The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.	10.97883279692529
Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards.	7.623162103457169
We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D.	9.535166183995813
O.	16.57850871695433
C.	14.373100099742409
points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.	13.915644303841136
We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication.	9.073541952151878
The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught.	9.838261998224649
Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen ’ s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.	10.027518911706215
The curse of my curses Seven days every day And seven dry Thursdays On you, Barney Kiernan, Has no sup of water To cool my courage, And my guts red roaring After Lowry ’ s lights.	8.337748672551857
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off.	17.364560102175734
And Joe asked him would he have another.	16.31972950694437
— I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there ’ s no ill feeling.	14.405590482245952
Gob, he ’ s not as green as he ’ s cabbagelooking.	19.0315324414803
Entertainment for man and beast.	17.26211112806317
And says Joe: — Could you make a hole in another pint?	19.966438345650946
— Could a swim duck?	11.72651951277238
says I.	15.317749111486599
— Same again, Terry, says Joe.	12.700048116775076
Are you sure you won ’ t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment?	16.918010041103706
says he.	15.700326219745547
— Thank you, no, says Bloom.	17.48406226758669
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don ’ t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam ’ s.	12.07366583694183
Martin asked me to go to the house.	24.677189366437336
You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn ’ t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can ’ t recover on the policy.	19.186081862404095
— Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that ’ s a good one if old Shylock is landed.	11.967417308711452
So the wife comes out top dog, what?	15.372326311969893
— Whose admirers?	15.291101566748228
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
— The wife ’ s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.	17.15254822359383
He was bloody safe he wasn ’ t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court.	13.301643178085772
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery.	10.516675152549709
O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.	9.70330793353733
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that ’ s dead to tell her.	15.191436884335543
Choking with bloody foolery.	13.464486823747084
And shaking Bloom ’ s hand doing the tragic to tell her that.	14.64124819403879
Shake hands, brother.	22.153868456826437
You ’ re a rogue and I ’ m another.	13.184871070392818
— Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour.	14.75764429336912
But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.	11.257475298358347
— No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.	12.295999575186942
— Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.	20.540358200983718
The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.	11.117081110780676
And off with him and out trying to walk straight.	24.946542445052028
Boosed at five o ’ clock.	11.048194928083998
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, <NUM> A.	14.218188799652957
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups.	14.265774487030942
And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve ’ s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging.	15.543813478809636
And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.	18.069419399184238
_How is your testament?	17.866392592428372
Have you got an old testament? _ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what.	18.437377576384872
Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady.	20.612791296805973
Jack Mooney ’ s sister.	25.239532903474114
And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples.	14.725277389509253
Gob, Jack made him toe the line.	14.877780066492091
Told him if he didn ’ t patch up the pot, Jesus, he ’ d kick the shite out of him.	14.774286875631063
So Terry brought the three pints.	16.033244993221533
— Here, says Joe, doing the honours.	15.28385483034236
Here, citizen.	19.288379468558357
— _Slan leat_, says he.	10.341243185456953
— Fortune, Joe, says I.	11.590355104234728
Good health, citizen.	16.730665758786333
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already.	16.492540322314582
Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.	17.648420743924323
— Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf?	15.61259693315976
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
— Friend of yours, says Alf.	13.172948161884904
— Nannan?	21.48280848017311
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
The mimber?	20.346460045751535
— I won ’ t mention any names, says Alf.	11.072278438531582
— I thought so, says Joe.	12.936888433142652
I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M.	13.47647022096767
P., the cattle traders.	22.75251279089852
— Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.	15.665853013040502
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.	15.173022213176633
Because he was up one time in a knacker ’ s yard.	26.710067937677767
Walking about with his book and pencil here ’ s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier.	16.051964533975205
Mister Knowall.	19.698768402221454
Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks.	13.82488721990272
Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O ’ Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her.	14.164165374491912
Couldn ’ t loosen her farting strings but old cod ’ s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it.	9.653488052458906
What ’ s your programme today?	14.641407231188266
Ay. Humane methods.	12.402000403216176
Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn ’ t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently.	12.813505171415564
Gob, he ’ d have a soft hand under a hen.	18.308810430920783
Klook Klook Klook.	13.44382079775892
Black Liz is our hen.	12.981330492742241
She lays eggs for us.	12.939959904809717
When she lays her egg she is so glad.	12.769747081212758
Gara.	43.67326148961827
Klook Klook Klook.	13.44382079775892
Then comes good uncle Leo.	11.210943616835223
He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg.	11.666800701328205
Ga ga ga ga Gara.	8.677713924489206
— Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going?	20.044041491931033
I wanted to see him, as it happens.	23.960560820618554
— Well, he ’ s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.	16.587937010888087
— That ’ s too bad, says Bloom.	12.752415611020407
I wanted particularly.	20.64843206540847
Perhaps only Mr Field is going.	12.684030482080114
I couldn ’ t phone.	17.137190888340637
No. You ’ re sure?	18.06157949181174
— Nannan ’ s going too, says Joe.	17.27981332409185
The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park.	12.767277957371693
What do you think of that, citizen?	21.85518959577224
_The Sluagh na h - Eireann_.	8.626137810676035
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham.	8.469259473532391
Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?	11.010284301843091
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.	11.858263688900553
Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house.	16.56257006596884
I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that.	11.153374158857357
The answer to the honourable member ’ s question is in the affirmative.	25.938421965227626
Mr Orelli O ’ Reilly (Montenotte.	12.388742129726607
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?	12.17136434479447
Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman ’ s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench?	10.269718654685928
(O! O!) Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.	18.749129263571824
Mr Staylewit (Buncombe.	11.112026058731262
Ind.): Don ’ t hesitate to shoot.	16.102081349693165
(Ironical opposition cheers.) The speaker: Order! Order! (The house rises.	9.869621424322307
Cheers.) — There ’ s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival.	18.45529798533498
There he is sitting there.	18.849101496098445
The man that got away James Stephens.	11.68235934666598
The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot.	11.180676832584718
What was your best throw, citizen?	14.203454939631087
— _Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest.	12.153528947553964
There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.	23.696238265584775
— Put it there, citizen, says Joe.	14.686958622058302
You were and a bloody sight better.	21.52937450735988
— Is that really a fact?	13.082885862177122
says Alf.	13.312592435631608
— Yes, says Bloom.	11.159524964207607
Did you not know that?	25.990480036784227
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that.	10.153583505812623
And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower ’ s heart violent exercise was bad.	14.5512865356931
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.	19.096428648377497
Do you see that straw?	17.69857656494536
That ’ s a straw_.	13.288962186507321
Declare to my aunt he ’ d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.	21.477153883721176
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian O ’ Ciarnain ’ s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of _Sluagh na h - Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.	9.658685522945484
The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions.	18.384078968074185
After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers.	12.246697816729192
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M ’ Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages.	9.991106434508774
L.	21.061307083543863
Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis ’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.	8.81906837338015
The Irish Caruso - Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it.	10.623244428012905
His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions.	11.593174275321658
The proceedings then terminated.	12.38670869309207

— Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh - Bennett match?	11.62985315767392
— No, says Joe.	10.516375520840175
— I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.	13.038616224826859
— Who?	12.787285610070553
Blazes?	50.80438943506273
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
And says Bloom: — What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.	14.495279372876515
— Ay, Blazes, says Alf.	11.389264174989872
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.	16.588091323585104
— We know him, says the citizen.	13.721275157912943
The traitor ’ s son.	19.404400054988795
We know what put English gold in his pocket.	15.674306842282848
— True for you, says Joe.	11.779608069542611
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf: — Now, don ’ t you think, Bergan?	13.567498548630013
Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it.	14.652941386212417

God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.	18.080304445750606
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.	8.420822051892065
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin ’ s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.	12.763962587246235
The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions.	9.933590255205866
The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet ’ s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.	11.550588699217927
The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett ’ s jaw.	13.393594961204391
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.	15.099880367751673
The men came to handigrips.	15.782932027276303
Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him.	12.738918030329032
The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime.	8.97951604915386
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.	19.98555141767563
The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.	6.967232038518725
The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.	7.419102322109446
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent ’ s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett ’ s stomach, flooring him flat.	10.388998234416647
Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett ’ s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.	9.33905592184259
— He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.	8.246989934174444
— He is, says Joe.	13.217803929450527
Isn ’ t he?	18.738177008351258
— Who?	12.787285610070553
says Bloom.	17.446113267736344
Ah, yes.	14.38540500846543
That ’ s quite true.	14.631976873669684

Gob, he ’ ll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I ’ m thinking.	15.525574511707926
— Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there?	12.638174549042526
says Alf.	13.312592435631608
U.	20.136332872350966
p: up.	11.441832688442634
— Yes, says J.	10.046812364928815
J.	9.525932994442917
Looking for a private detective.	22.644392039968654
— Ay, says Ned.	11.152281568923678
And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.	11.578226632511834
— Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing.	13.571791374927328
God, I ’ d give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.	15.77394030164597
— Was it you did it, Alf?	24.340146670152752
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.	15.900620012430142
— Me?	21.580866510380396
says Alf.	13.312592435631608
Don ’ t cast your nasturtiums on my character.	11.23807822776656
— Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.	13.79946582639432
— Of course an action would lie, says J.	11.236032737502368
J.	9.525932994442917
It implies that he is not _compos mentis_.	15.26299265628259
U.	20.136332872350966
p: up.	11.441832688442634
_ — Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing.	11.741634130413091
Do you know that he ’ s balmy?	22.514363975759455
Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.	18.918927729479638
— Yes, says J.	10.046812364928815
J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.	15.804966397403117
— Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.	11.654125072762083
— Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.	24.500187552556095
— Pity about her, says the citizen.	14.45230052362768
Or any other woman marries a half and half.	14.039921660285025
— How half and half?	15.228960711956647
says Bloom.	17.446113267736344
Do you mean he...	15.137553436567446
— Half and half I mean, says the citizen.	10.965143097979878
A fellow that ’ s neither fish nor flesh.	16.01915786972608
— Nor good red herring, says Joe.	8.728218803713064
A pishogue, if you know what that is.	17.273594875945054
Begob I saw there was trouble coming.	20.82766231410406
And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool.	18.16621892404881
Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain.	15.930609275404516
And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow ’ s was pewopener to the pope.	17.555640659674285
Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney ’ s moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.	15.081137176645699
And who was he, tell us?	30.62668134717668
A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.	13.835831911604481
— And moreover, says J.	10.958483209489277
J., a postcard is publication.	17.82760278216291
It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v.	12.416695877524356
Hole.	44.876532221709276
In my opinion an action might lie.	10.513425760189033
Six and eightpence, please.	13.037973929823275
Who wants your opinion?	17.053662962314565
Let us drink our pints in peace.	10.140006229565019
Gob, we won ’ t be let even do that much itself.	14.993928334851658
— Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.	16.183155560027952
— Good health, Ned, says J.	13.58729077805484
J.	9.525932994442917
— - There he is again, says Joe.	12.999494289775228
— Where?	19.308514080516858
says Alf.	13.312592435631608
And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.	18.803427568242245
— How did that Canada swindle case go off?	11.480614570604738
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
— Remanded, says J.	12.637306288103936
J.	9.525932994442917
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he ’ d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob.	11.02374600093374
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?	22.248197305016884
Course it was a bloody barney.	25.68688109670664
What?	14.617951109062046
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too.	15.413043028060272
J.	9.525932994442917
J.	9.525932994442917
was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.	16.38165617582179
— Who tried the case?	16.699425307821045
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
— Recorder, says Ned.	14.561129030243205
— Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.	18.20674079809624
— Heart as big as a lion, says Ned.	14.820598238738311
— Ay, says Alf.	9.350718323200924
Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn ’ t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that ’ s minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.	13.430657435839574
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry: — A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?	14.32249677423918
Ten, did you say?	25.628023983743113
— Yes, your worship.	15.09558348807631
And my wife has the typhoid.	18.091998662335833
— And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir.	8.49027569200073
No, sir, I ’ ll make no order for payment.	13.486854881681602
How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.	16.68539696680508
And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law.	18.627148757218094
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.	10.45722455861447
And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.	12.073572482363064
And he sat him there about the hour of five o ’ clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin.	18.619189506579502
And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true.	13.399755850728196
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book.	11.580736974388364
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness.	14.558850487837159
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received.	8.647444082259371
And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.	10.982627608883574
— Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.	11.214586729686788
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn ’ t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford.	16.554748298596373
And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he ’ d do the devil and all.	16.687235117094314
— Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition.	21.233879507105822
That ’ s the whole secret.	15.814647616276813
— Rely on me, says Joe.	14.447089254679105
— Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland.	14.236535820642146
We want no more strangers in our house.	15.153165658151387
— O, I ’ m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom.	14.928441504473282
It ’ s just that Keyes, you see.	13.062827094390853
— Consider that done, says Joe.	11.031076461361058
— Very kind of you, says Bloom.	18.26426419319188
— The strangers, says the citizen.	10.701863919030203
Our own fault.	19.480923563868647
We let them come in.	18.601202561355365
We brought them in.	20.86445885894997
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.	10.730812600247418
— Decree _nisi, _ says J.	10.630197491941761
J.	9.525932994442917
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider ’ s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.	19.19396332186704
— A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that ’ s what ’ s the cause of all our misfortunes.	15.64472241159502
— And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_ with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.	16.488481263208826
— Give us a squint at her, says I.	13.54383969416227

Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?	13.517836348120655
So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.	15.1779956316385
— Well, says the citizen, what ’ s the latest from the scene of action?	15.107951253898612
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?	12.995938295037627
O ’ Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.	12.77728141270204
— It ’ s on the march, says the citizen.	13.801744972948137
To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their <URL> So J.	14.198348838248744
J.	9.525932994442917
puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.	11.34891392081221
— Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen.	11.947046587248456
To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores ’ gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name.	14.18942091973498
Any civilisation they have they stole from us.	12.227293019736303

I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris.	9.914908759085675
You wouldn ’ t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d ’ <URL> And says John Wyse: — Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.	11.838834287753297
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo: — _Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion! _ He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.	11.347602735842392
— What ’ s up with you, says I to Lenehan.	18.039977407996727
You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.	18.548771443298882
— Gold cup, says he.	15.772589201006893
— Who won, Mr Lenehan?	19.870266784783727
says Terry.	21.40333121396919
_ — Throwaway, _ says he, at twenty to one.	17.07178482005182

The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley.	7.942708243606171
Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey - Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence.	6.074007699307656
The bride who was given away by her father, the M ’ Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze.	9.897967356957754
The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.	9.695647466306816
Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of _Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service.	13.542482101156887
On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.	5.2570053801316
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.	10.222306932287381
— And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.	10.83089052591098
We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.	11.88400484815727
— And will again, says Joe.	11.408753389685346
— And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh.	17.11582269947894
Our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O ’ Reillys and the O ’ Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.	11.969339613233986
And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor ’ s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.	14.778384842450139

As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren ’ t show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.	13.999841000361139
What will you have?	31.543715864305828
— An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.	13.600877595186386
— Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.	16.602615583449097
Terry! Are you asleep?	19.25492913556994
— Yes, sir, says Terry.	13.301823897917137
Small whisky and bottle of Allsop.	10.712462692774663
Right, sir.	16.561995740419235
Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public.	15.656419556138948
Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate.	18.390276822665175
A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him.	12.920522405986205
Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.	17.11054426198761
— But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?	13.81568397904625
— I ’ ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.	12.378563616377036
Hell upon earth it is.	14.486995468003256
Read the revelations that ’ s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth.	13.669914523514123
A fellow writes that calls himself _Disgusted One_.	7.288451316928082
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.	13.298454711411315
— A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God ’ s Englishman calls it caning on the breech.	14.12053590436542
And says John Wyse: — ’ Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.	14.228189770862949
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.	15.487941504427805
— That ’ s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.	10.526512891169073
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God ’ s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.	18.030773187115248
That ’ s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.	7.588444454264071
— On which the sun never rises, says Joe.	14.435361513957103
— And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.	17.119989107595774
The unfortunate yahoos believe it.	10.63996193567687
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.	10.178516741352766
— But, says Bloom, isn ’ t discipline the same everywhere.	18.72121905650775
I mean wouldn ’ t it be the same here if you put force against force?	17.017526714372682
Didn ’ t I tell you?	17.79994187382768
As true as I ’ m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he ’ d try to downface you that dying was living.	13.266848240700023
— We ’ ll put force against force, says the citizen.	9.774265715246674
We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea.	11.081278042106785
They were driven out of house and home in the black <NUM>.	18.84188617926769
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America.	8.94093002353113
Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres.	8.566510437179657
But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.	9.001646812192377
Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes.	17.74621511063072
Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships.	25.464179087842634
But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage.	22.034446058723628
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.	14.891604565720318
— Perfectly true, says Bloom.	15.337535224708038
But my point was...	15.70267637467536
— We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned.	20.071865214291126
— Ay, says John Wyse.	10.387195349751089
We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us.	11.316488544064624
Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone.	19.606999045308275
We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese.	12.050151532684753
Fontenoy, eh?	15.580587241086967
And Sarsfield and O ’ Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa.	9.05464039021234
But what did we ever get for it?	17.18034896144105
— The French! says the citizen.	10.92836329229785
Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is?	14.62085034828427
They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.	10.12945307519483
— _Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.	9.134048079459186
— And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven ’ t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that ’ s dead?	14.29479828979023
Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.	13.9511046252105
— Well, says J.	11.162147786518075
J.	9.525932994442917
We have Edward the peacemaker now.	10.380273608256799
— Tell that to a fool, says the citizen.	14.910864963550988
Edward Guelph - Wettin! — And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty ’ s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode.	12.59966327749924
The earl of Dublin, no less.	22.61319463048164
— They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.	16.81630459536553
And says J.	14.143231906291057
J.: — Considerations of space influenced their lordships ’ decision.	9.79575242433744
— Will you try another, citizen?	16.31866087502725
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
— Yes, sir, says he.	10.644237501968819
I will.	18.857562091351173
— You?	21.65822676770484
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
— Beholden to you, Joe, says I.	15.857782700060975
May your shadow never grow less.	11.710227494569276
— Repeat that dose, says Joe.	8.606898434463766
— Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.	18.946193215055985
Perpetuating national hatred among nations.	10.62658392950319
— But do you know what a nation means?	19.4903387359666
says John Wyse.	14.391700342000048
— Yes, says Bloom.	11.159524964207607
— What is it?	10.593475497978059
says John Wyse.	14.391700342000048
— A nation?	19.832744651813478
says Bloom.	17.446113267736344
A nation is the same people living in the same place.	21.040631099927058
— By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that ’ s so I ’ m a nation for I ’ m living in the same place for the past five years.	20.71145363793846
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it: — Or also living in different places.	17.765765594036946
— What is your nation if I may ask?	14.218418288370957
says the citizen.	10.40050339054841
— Ireland, says Bloom.	20.80607945916467
Ireland.	35.03045700230439
The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.	14.938001518442876
— After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.	13.513327883652556
— Here you are, citizen, says Joe.	12.144539508343884
Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.	18.338029846604872
The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration.	6.309312074050805
No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill.	12.637311228926649
The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides.	8.526990996943226
Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland ’ s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh ’ s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde ’ s tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun ’ s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch ’ s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury ’ s Hotel, S.	9.793367316546323
Patrick ’ s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley ’ s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal ’ s Cave — all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.	13.296087911389323
— Show us over the drink, says I.	16.994280221722242
Which is which?	20.216878155465512
— That ’ s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.	20.189441020612694
Also now.	23.12125856319547
This very moment.	17.689447912143955
This very instant.	17.989636645349595
Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.	20.59395897616766
— Robbed, says he.	12.713856708439073
Plundered.	44.876532221709276
Insulted.	44.876532221709276
Persecuted.	44.876532221709276
Taking what belongs to us by right.	13.739757024527702
At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.	11.00808601432224
— Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?	18.70836528698417
says the citizen.	10.40050339054841
— I ’ m talking about injustice, says Bloom.	10.448765214724647
— Right, says John Wyse.	13.402299999803002
Stand up to it then with force like men.	18.20371992064158
That ’ s an almanac picture for you.	10.215354460015664
Mark for a softnosed bullet.	20.484761083545294
Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun.	21.114084534562465
Gob, he ’ d adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse ’ s apron on him.	15.84092566090504
And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.	16.956083390623192
— But it ’ s no use, says he.	16.313426101303058
Force, hatred, history, all that.	13.942760798101006
That ’ s not life for men and women, insult and hatred.	11.269763305353564
And everybody knows that it ’ s the very opposite of that that is really life.	20.137249076675097
— What?	11.778589598318154
says Alf.	13.312592435631608
— Love, says Bloom.	18.064468488670496
I mean the opposite of hatred.	13.03069027744689
I must go now, says he to John Wyse.	17.092225211775855
Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there.	21.876972557713696
If he comes just say I ’ ll be back in a second.	19.12953796672144
Just a moment.	15.302732917844983
Who ’ s hindering you?	17.12728847183089
And off he pops like greased lightning.	7.953262450455137
— A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen.	12.17315541608286
Universal love.	26.010081658468764
— Well, says John Wyse.	11.767448544489216
Isn ’ t that what we ’ re told.	18.42069250777795
Love your neighbour.	17.596962116992064
— That chap?	18.808913864147744
says the citizen.	10.40050339054841
Beggar my neighbour is his motto.	15.137788414064945
Love, moya! He ’ s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.	13.48359137217453
Love loves to love love.	14.76489948618131
Nurse loves the new chemist.	19.39129537507413
Constable <NUM> A loves Mary Kelly.	11.331813487050189
Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.	17.187561849341662

B.	17.785236174055573

Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye.	11.733001752595118
The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead.	17.01748156968278
His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen.	10.789165675536822
Mrs Norman W.	14.235604304173046
Tupper loves officer Taylor.	11.611703010550823
You love a certain person.	19.70840985482587
And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.	8.52836447059633
— Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song.	14.354060436292974
More power, citizen.	15.164929695217303
— Hurrah, there, says Joe.	14.494552028605034
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.	12.66825611328629
— We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.	9.216978254516247
What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_ pasted round the mouth of his cannon?	12.2177232504133
The bible! Did you read that skit in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that ’ s visiting England?	11.97449734350806
— What ’ s that?	11.872792500682896
says Joe.	10.239310108916836
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out: — A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions.	9.48619616546454
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England ’ s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor.	12.618814020640535
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors ’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.	8.984724167098708
— Widow woman, says Ned.	18.057800329331403
I wouldn ’ t doubt her.	14.960944293033975
Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.	25.013300143644987
— Same only more so, says Lenehan.	13.364729434554986
And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.	7.638688043756663
— Is that by Griffith?	14.804105589142955
says John Wyse.	14.391700342000048
— No, says the citizen.	10.107763036292145
It ’ s not signed Shanganagh.	11.526296851670606
It ’ s only initialled: P.	10.319931096787565
— And a very good initial too, says Joe.	13.354731753099692
— That ’ s how it ’ s worked, says the citizen.	13.700606946858626
Trade follows the flag.	14.659002458458838
— Well, says J.	11.162147786518075
J., if they ’ re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad.	13.773324614554308
Did you read that report by a man what ’ s this his name is?	19.487359478686315
— Casement, says the citizen.	10.427683283417137
He ’ s an Irishman.	15.977844929680845
— Yes, that ’ s the man, says J.	14.36606526613755
J.	9.525932994442917
Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.	14.061668057848182
— I know where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.	16.583596412226598
— Who?	12.787285610070553
says I.	15.317749111486599
— Bloom, says he.	16.658479012254173
The courthouse is a blind.	22.346495347439056
He had a few bob on _Throwaway_ and he ’ s gone to gather in the shekels.	17.40497319141308
— Is it that whiteeyed kaffir?	11.16422359813883
says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?	15.572244413789724
— That ’ s where he ’ s gone, says Lenehan.	17.141335523833316
I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.	18.78723865979707
He ’ s the only man in Dublin has it.	15.610614664465038
A dark horse.	18.862835336117303
— He ’ s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.	12.568438349503325
— Mind, Joe, says I.	12.387604811552096
Show us the entrance out.	17.574674398235004
— There you are, says Terry.	17.85387341662972
Goodbye Ireland I ’ m going to Gort.	15.598529126859942
So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my _ (Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery ’ s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she ’ s better_ or _she ’ s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there ’ s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.	12.711335678504794
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries.	10.634528506897912
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.	15.478987598026658
Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.	13.005910068566259
Give us a bloody chance.	18.882104009799672
God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout.	20.32324759281172
Mr Bloom with his argol bargol.	13.628660359763922
And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds.	13.24275593415183
Loans by post on easy terms.	11.64693844833902
Any amount of money advanced on note of hand.	12.576456475311877
Distance no object.	18.956304581307432
No security.	23.56689656462179
Gob, he ’ s like Lanty MacHale ’ s goat that ’ d go a piece of the road with every one.	16.53121187726295
— Well, it ’ s a fact, says John Wyse.	14.139185399006266
And there ’ s the man now that ’ ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.	20.675037951527948
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general ’ s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king ’ s expense.	14.319410399959699
Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.	8.188527635309086
— Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.	16.292995197687528
Saucy knave! To us! So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.	11.679128397416815
Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.	15.686528319598208
— Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.	15.615675527821772
— Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked.	10.307259328974784
Look to our steeds.	18.064907437150232
— Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder.	14.061341064023106
I know not what to offer your lordships.	12.741174420765118
— How now, fellow?	20.165254013832186
cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king ’ s messengers, master Taptun?	13.596203583459113
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord ’ s visage.	12.55267305661883
— Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly.	13.158223796601588
An you be the king ’ s messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught.	12.99595518061486
The king ’ s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.	11.620115559294911
— Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect.	14.457493545320041
Hast aught to give us?	19.30527326925771
Mine host bowed again as he made answer: — What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog ’ s bacon, a boar ’ s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?	13.115279485303294
— Gadzooks! cried the last speaker.	15.766466708790857
That likes me well.	16.41886740690192
Pistachios! — Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance.	22.418743773161765
A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! ’ Tis a merry rogue.	11.352973516068955
So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.	11.17393175498191
— Where is he?	15.752669229407468
says Lenehan.	22.577485758881277
Defrauding widows and orphans.	12.079343258020867
— Isn ’ t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?	18.838561388589216
— That ’ s so, says Martin.	15.100529208462103
Or so they allege.	14.890655832314652
— I, says Joe.	11.79127225572322
I ’ m the alligator.	10.375075074565258
— And after all, says John Wyse, why can ’ t a jew love his country like the next fellow?	16.316663896858742
— Why not?	16.32583457062546
says J.	15.045791168720315
— Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he?	16.25053638715485
says Ned.	19.109653474000524
Or who is he?	23.350896437673835
No offence, Crofton.	14.378611791335308
— Who is Junius?	13.11041258187139
says J.	15.045791168720315
— We don ’ t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.	11.718034607795452
— He ’ s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system.	16.683432535103208
We know that in the castle.	32.440871841396394
— Isn ’ t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist?	13.916923965457643
says Jack Power.	21.66970799869058
— Not at all, says Martin.	17.585436141296874
Only namesakes.	20.581242179641293
His name was Virag, the father ’ s name that poisoned himself.	18.97699030641634
He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.	20.867685855823318
— That ’ s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen.	10.925036452018423
Island of saints and sages! — Well, they ’ re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin.	14.90147129636619
For that matter so are we.	15.152567377030385
— Yes, says J.	10.046812364928815
J., and every male that ’ s born they think it may be their Messiah.	16.768580364727907
And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he ’ s a father or a mother.	19.936795038722806
— Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.	14.260823590758505
— O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born.	15.821500977705169
I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave ’ s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.	13.330322519036187
— _En ventre sa mère_, says J.	7.5514408344901405
J.	9.525932994442917
— Do you call that a man?	23.350422803228234
says the citizen.	10.40050339054841
— I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.	16.671134075905062
— Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.	14.686391877256895
— And who does he suspect?	14.858554299753695
says the citizen.	10.40050339054841
Gob, there ’ s many a true word spoken in jest.	12.933172395491438
One of those mixed middlings he is.	12.033551096121403
Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses.	14.689977699879947
Do you know what I ’ m telling you?	13.358875629529933
It ’ d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea.	20.615178325065028
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man.	15.728713867797266
Give us your blessing.	17.370670932216555
— Charity to the neighbour, says Martin.	21.016694842003304
But where is he?	21.158292149434562
We can ’ t wait.	19.75816503605952
— A wolf in sheep ’ s clothing, says the citizen.	11.981566558493466
That ’ s what he is.	18.27493196955956
Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him.	9.521605433570992
Cursed by God.	20.860144241823793
— Have you time for a brief libation, Martin?	17.328558481767658
says Ned.	19.109653474000524
— Only one, says Martin.	20.597491601854983
We must be quick.	22.080199241493247
J.	9.525932994442917
J.	9.525932994442917
and S.	11.467054430131709
— You, Jack?	19.1144774237843
Crofton?	53.92685769556542
Three half ones, Terry.	14.884504044306109
— Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.	10.39397207793878
— Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass.	12.990641110930818
God bless all here is my prayer.	15.604410511210265
— Amen, says the citizen.	11.291826301139821
— And I ’ m sure He will, says Joe.	12.441228472703433
And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S.	7.429469041118689

And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags ’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns.	4.925844024194148
And as they wended their way by Nelson ’ s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying.	6.872484204453354
And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O ’ Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick.	9.674229855159522
And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein.	10.74459073696723
And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.	15.983995501887795
— _Adiutorium nostrum in nomine <URL> — _Qui fecit cœlum et <URL> — _Dominus <URL> — _Et cum spiritu <URL> And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed: — _Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum <URL> — And so say all of us, says Jack.	6.010338669055448
— Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.	15.14192489133857
— Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson.	15.693139748940027
And butter for fish.	14.03287944073283
I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.	14.339226112637563
— I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you.	17.41961702117444
I hope I ’ m not...	14.844521586290135
— No, says Martin, we ’ re ready.	17.79534913735673
Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.	14.67618450209515
Mean bloody scut.	14.671157678905011
Stand us a drink itself.	23.99360678164458
Devil a sweet fear! There ’ s a jew for you! All for number one.	16.237789945223202
Cute as a shithouse rat.	18.93144283327534
Hundred to five.	17.542009140538084
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen.	9.549715880725092
— Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue.	19.17404089432811
Come along now.	18.526174629545967
— Don ’ t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him.	9.742059085152107
It ’ s a secret.	16.60800350736059
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.	16.191087049392507
— Bye bye all, says Martin.	15.080159582684765
And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.	20.53577608233241
— Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.	23.68514498034544
The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard.	10.54807241753676
A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair.	11.15774053252321
Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.	17.54475875868763
And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.	14.541306890548087
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.	14.037375221468423
— Let me alone, says he.	15.857204277559113
And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him: — Three cheers for Israel! Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ ’ sake and don ’ t be making a public exhibition of yourself.	14.245263794356218
Jesus, there ’ s always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing.	14.00302783621235
Gob, it ’ d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.	17.9680463969418
And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her: — Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister! And says he: — Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza.	14.636017459424892
And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew.	20.16255697929235
Your God.	24.215153129079784
— He had no father, says Martin.	20.012564022461685
That ’ ll do now.	15.172023073007946
Drive ahead.	22.079930705352552
— Whose God?	16.354479346649757
says the citizen.	10.40050339054841
— Well, his uncle was a jew, says he.	15.79317688875349
Your God was a jew.	19.298826693025877
Christ was a jew like me.	22.894344304101427
Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.	20.687451214046245
— By Jesus, says he, I ’ ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.	12.208579371962918
By Jesus, I ’ ll crucify him so I will.	15.846182081903605
Give us that biscuitbox here.	10.296974198643898
— Stop! Stop! says Joe.	14.322909444384328
The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was characterised by the most affecting cordiality.	11.482911588834158
An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.	13.20087998637866
The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_, followed immediately by _Rakóczsy ’ s March_.	9.307607668685966
Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M ’ Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.	10.589778202169427
Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.	10.58282926547671
_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra! _ Gone but not forgotten.	9.814263006380587
And Ned and J.	12.38392365740924
J.	9.525932994442917
paralysed with the laughing.	32.14919949659552
— Bloody wars, says I, I ’ ll be in for the last gospel.	18.31080189227982
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag ’ s head round the other way and off with him.	17.500745175125328
— Hold on, citizen, says Joe.	14.056921523406757
Stop! Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly.	14.224048245729131
Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he ’ d have left him for dead.	22.350449949324563
Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford.	16.007623949895173
The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.	14.612720363879864
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect.	10.383259806532909
The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli ’ s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of <NUM>, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas.	13.246300491876852
The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn ’ s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch.	8.938548218333334
All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.	13.645330773489752
From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character.	7.065627726701253
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant ’ s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale.	11.552099493947052
Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west.	7.889908349005379
Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.	10.363605792176038

The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses.	9.414790524954132
What?	14.617951109062046
O, Jesus, he did.	22.786025846877838
And he let a volley of oaths after him.	10.734591780531673
— Did I kill him, says he, or what?	17.8211488915374
And he shouting to the bloody dog: — After him, Garry! After him, boy! And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.	17.086466001685643
Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.	19.193556566728326
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven.	13.417183688505581
And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him.	14.28641317028494
And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah! Elijah! _ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai! _ And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe ’ s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.	11.312830755646317
The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.	10.417799928279571
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.	12.783524538858083
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.	14.39019139369648
Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _H.	11.391490680788856
M.	18.41939908880623
S.	16.596153063908286
Belleisle_ printed on both.	19.772611311892252
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.	7.651573175811067
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long.	12.481048858696363
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight.	8.909569989802993
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.	12.954561729240215
Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.	16.291932384613528
— Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.	11.803609057220966
Say out big, big.	17.595402374877967
I want a drink of water.	18.114009691824606
And baby prattled after her: — A jink a jink a jawbo.	10.613264852699096
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on.	10.960625589537967
What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib.	13.34456374994166
None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.	10.89442947399546
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.	16.005836152078487
And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.	13.686056816946856
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky.	14.27195619312084
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule.	13.21948268776692
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had.	11.989477388439791
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman ’ s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too.	11.404441230970233
— Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.	15.30247003460084
At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.	18.076458643380462
Wait till I catch you for that.	15.350133114371378
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister ’ s word was law with the twins.	11.713878015222125
And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure.	20.04090449916639
His little man - o ’ - war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life ’ s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.	11.736795144796345
Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn ’ t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.	12.554237994947462
— Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.	10.62269239992263
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly: — What ’ s your name?	13.90903216354098
Butter and cream?	22.681270869945468
Is Cissy your sweetheart?	14.444589352376441
— Nao, tearful Tommy said.	7.9654062202758515
Cissy queried.	25.45400865737191
— Nao, Tommy said.	9.86151809774547
— I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes.	10.178564606143503
I know who is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	21.37078113869126
Gerty is Tommy ’ s sweetheart.	20.601941637798806
— Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.	14.210287183720947
Cissy ’ s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn ’ t see and to mind he didn ’ t wet his new tan shoes.	14.47334405261629
But who was Gerty?	30.26612660325889
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see.	12.914898252341759
She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.	13.96514885282608
Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch ’ s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling.	10.120817678192552
The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid ’ s bow, Greekly perfect.	9.985107125126136
Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.	10.156163930825796
Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she ’ d never speak to her again.	15.72941074542029
No. Honour where honour is due.	9.662851959433146
There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.	9.504073051822783
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.	10.71709089600805
Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist.	15.594923742212837
Why have women such eyes of witchery?	11.020049755928037
Gerty ’ s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows.	12.813691422463227
Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive.	11.245629694346645
It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.	11.908768645038522
Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?	12.91047606825384
That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one.	14.819735139663795
But Gerty ’ s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.	12.735233080266859
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it.	16.97656329826047
She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.	10.876661770608782
And just now at Edy ’ s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God ’ s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.	13.15406592452272
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.	13.715273173592896
She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.	13.752282758718495
Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.	17.868542322331972
She knew right well, no - one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers ’ quarrel.	14.442531054721318
As per usual somebody ’ s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window.	16.616743436365603
Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W.	18.79441565776739
E.	17.860184031499212
Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.	16.357282572175308
Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core.	13.090108001489035
Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time.	18.835683339056246
They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph.	14.630217615024556
But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn ’ t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.	17.83575481104267
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out.	14.337037251690674
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the _Lady ’ s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection.	10.457913146211254
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.	8.50337256973495
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery ’ s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.	12.769623416937948
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.	19.558774452497797
Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep.	9.813364023170916
Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops.	7.5109328388571
As for undies they were Gerty ’ s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her?	10.859526049637346
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn ’ t trust those washerwomen as far as she ’ d see them scorching the things.	8.883438816417682
She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers ’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn ’ t of a Friday.	14.96896232803592
And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time.	13.493390842969049
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror.	15.986688714621401
You are lovely, Gerty, it said.	19.01751486974961
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.	10.849834261887134
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.	13.685120840961908
C.	14.373100099742409
D.	18.383350212219998
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be.	10.649510583985311
He was too young to understand.	19.057706386813287
He would not believe in love, a woman ’ s birthright.	24.368310681592583
The night of the party long ago in Stoer ’ s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.	16.512336895357844
He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments.	18.323531401124896
Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie ’ s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.	12.705281728540093
But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over.	16.44000599477311
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss.	12.69915062578508
It would be like heaven.	19.029311358658216
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve.	10.142942902446585
With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.	15.374971619049807
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be.	14.356351444950684
Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November.	15.766809840959478
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess.	9.619224821355832
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann ’ s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn ’ t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn ’ t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap ’ s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery ’ s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.	9.544699192068094
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.	18.786255427188394
But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there ’ d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please.	18.889934984798696
The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.	19.33003472864266
Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.	24.805332990105352
— You ’ re not my sister, naughty Tommy said.	10.231738071748044
It ’ s my ball.	14.876738297133725
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.	15.824524734748504
— Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.	19.640222968542005
And she tickled tiny tot ’ s two cheeks to make him forget and played here ’ s the lord mayor, here ’ s his two horses, here ’ s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin.	10.60823364597278
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.	11.526410587275336
— I ’ d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won ’ t say.	17.463895843036568
— On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.	11.21708033387353
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she ’ d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.	12.627139398106419
But not a pin cared Ciss.	17.170100395853854
— Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose.	19.997726300138197
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I ’ d look at him.	23.034829994926177
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls.	14.495095501574967
You had to laugh at her sometimes.	19.849855717346117
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men ’ s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White.	14.625512744074735
That was just like Cissycums.	17.744192646568614
O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father ’ s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.	17.43441331500249
There was none to come up to her for fun.	22.469426289318125
But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.	15.304521351211694
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ.	20.558025871389045
It was the men ’ s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.	14.954391942354492
J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament.	11.134819815102341
They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins.	11.758000663992565
How sad to poor Gerty ’ s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson ’ s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none.	11.487431802348306
Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.	14.827028535104338
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days.	7.292774243434947
Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.	17.094666284491304
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful.	9.773575866806018
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.	11.291737594559516
You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.	16.99683699715975
Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby ’ s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.	10.833338147923541
Her mother ’ s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.	15.539587672092452
No - one would have thought the end was so near.	18.135580442162702
Now he was laid to rest.	21.604343929483743
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn ’ t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby ’ s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.	14.817794602574043
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold.	14.775551488390468
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn ’ t like her mother ’ s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.	10.3000152137004
Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways.	26.171941670914144
You could see there was a story behind it.	20.69605487779541
She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.	19.46587140212066
She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker ’ s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.	13.307041122859804
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks.	10.564408732491536
Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball.	10.672600695374594
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please.	11.629812929651862
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn ’ t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.	13.669286402239335
— If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.	12.071288045159672
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.	9.278269072339729
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.	15.111412411032108
Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.	13.898184200222559
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.	9.476927573197825
And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin ’ s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.	11.796935675694368
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.	8.093066903322454
Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.	9.16650534138891
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn ’ t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.	17.652914926672935
— Say papa, baby.	13.397539516329289
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.	6.884019960434256
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.	15.616681239321776
— Haja ja ja haja.	7.7643375538593675
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him.	12.189810115657556
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.	8.978936103515164
It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.	12.839406037221515
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins.	17.372512932396305
She gazed out towards the distant sea.	16.37150669818743
And while she gazed her heart went pitapat.	10.381487984362067
Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look.	25.559703144057394
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul.	10.427222490375142
Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them?	13.119715107950768
People were so queer.	20.13499171437688
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn ’ t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting.	15.133557632010906
He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.	20.80428153589063
She would have given worlds to know what it was.	18.188751218438288
He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down.	16.883336587631035
She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away.	15.593000429104546
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.	24.87529948274455
It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no - one else.	17.693478986583305
If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not.	17.192666963382077
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her.	12.3884835429196
There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm.	8.216306314374966
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn ’ t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past.	14.494784181876398
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.	15.827313793613929
Refuge of sinners.	14.679575486394208
Comfortress of the afflicted.	42.21481354453669
_Ora pro nobis_.	14.954512510232338
Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart.	11.627478855634505
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin ’ s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O ’ Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down.	18.96267494604214
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic.	13.527498554386655
He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature ’ s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word.	17.127587053652068
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours ’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.	14.18386749032791
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.	12.296080083701334
Little monkeys common as ditchwater.	11.345224170310185
Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them.	22.076064771487875
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.	16.879868295335832
— Jacky! Tommy! Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she ’ d ever bring them out.	14.998689063267905
She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn ’ t get it to grow long because it wasn ’ t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it.	17.210954894748703
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn ’ t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible.	16.16711336179134
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble.	11.893862448488191
_Tableau! _ That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness.	21.55885055633996
Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O ’ Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn ’ t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O ’ Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.	13.62594428067972
Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow ’ s of George ’ s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn ’ t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.	15.165705424623454
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature.	16.708088256071502
Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl ’ s shoulders — a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.	14.309878160523226
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.	14.096552640269158
She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve.	11.706138874231332
She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.	12.69673470102494
He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey.	11.853540943171849
Her woman ’ s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.	15.28839553009017
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.	12.44367498096984
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no - one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers.	16.142578956290567
And she said to Gerty: — A penny for your thoughts.	20.136824284651343
— What?	11.778589598318154
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.	16.585776309089873
I was only wondering was it late.	17.471399771165217
Because she wished to goodness they ’ d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late.	13.872362980595822
And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again.	17.302446653697828
But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.	21.141544459847086
— Wait, said Cissy, I ’ ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what ’ s the time by his conundrum.	15.748660355000773
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church.	19.563589773071076
Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself.	16.183413028134808
One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.	16.13137548798609
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set.	16.050179680495166
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.	17.22067323804003
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.	15.419955213280627
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O ’ Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.	15.772862978981959
It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets.	20.88574760761448
She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon.	17.377775874483426
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.	11.228144999690826
If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man ’ s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man ’ s face.	18.258866541581266
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.	22.549039266376703
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins ’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O ’ Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.	12.952064991279475
Gerty winced sharply.	14.628184970751814
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable.	9.730081855330498
It hurt — O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.	13.167311112515863
Gerty ’ s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.	11.098038731740738
She had loved him better than he knew.	15.551917702426275
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.	16.23283741449489
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.	11.81263061897332
— O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up.	13.326315420577147
I can throw my cap at who I like because it ’ s leap year.	13.634872496561437
Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.	12.195899531697167
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.	21.58359417880506
As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces.	13.932937578195691
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.	13.589182230717228
Miss puny little Edy ’ s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.	14.763899335351459
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior.	14.873349290006773
And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.	13.380391533343104
— O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss.	7.257512619899952
He has his bib destroyed.	12.67163206686921
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.	8.550781338409536
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O ’ Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.	13.368409887918954
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry.	14.008538624230148
And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.	9.870778355759189
For Gerty had her dreams that no - one knew of.	12.81334934905355
She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean.	12.888710246870744
It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely ’ s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs.	12.925670047566797
_Art thou real, my ideal? _ it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou ever? _ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.	11.810521800237547
But it must end, she felt.	23.11773068843128
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her.	15.018782932656391
Love laughs at locksmiths.	12.173153777925071
She would make the great sacrifice.	20.857645281019998
Her every effort would be to share his thoughts.	12.638092593923663
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness.	14.878139285809539
There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.	17.188247176953787
But even if — what then?	14.07130229514532
Would it make a very great difference?	17.980412200945153
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled.	10.131635927910631
No, no: not that.	18.450516800318436
They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.	15.561042832776074
Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.	21.354048221174576
She thought she understood.	18.871311009827846
She would try to understand him because men were so different.	14.450521487860058
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.	13.098590477759563
Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide.	24.968621507177097
Nothing else mattered.	16.208029285874197
Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.	12.597955694366988
Canon O ’ Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn ’ t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out: — O, look, Cissy! And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.	12.421393716005731
— It ’ s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.	11.47136822501195
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn ’ t fall running.	16.237504009587507
— Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.	14.653640246063752
It ’ s the bazaar fireworks.	13.29864418766022
But Gerty was adamant.	14.326816080967824
She had no intention of being at their beck and call.	12.38871392563011
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was.	14.973554705206288
The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling.	10.074182294365471
She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.	18.799888588463165
Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.	23.331704835217835
At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips.	15.631320766435751
His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her.	14.006013616701077
She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no - one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she ’ d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed.	14.646773617802545
But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips.	19.18864218766758
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn ’ t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors ’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.	15.208025502522407
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.	16.803241440914512
And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no - one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn ’ t ashamed and he wasn ’ t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn ’ t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.	14.825642455078958
She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl ’ s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages.	17.896971848339987
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft! Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.	11.602428604411305
Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.	14.934763180168723
He was leaning back against the rock behind.	16.205189640125646
Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.	14.549561666135121
What a brute he had been! At it again?	14.316405447349446
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?	17.37693941020541
An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered.	15.764565808097894
Should a girl tell?	21.960307809226382
No, a thousand times no.	20.38706663155342
That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don ’ t tell.	12.30017320860028
Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried: — Gerty! Gerty! We ’ re going.	16.66012907407003
Come on.	19.227485892247252
We can see from farther up.	17.63993793789061
Gerty had an idea, one of love ’ s little ruses.	23.9380301252055
She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back.	13.383499617514133
Wonder if he ’ s too far to.	21.10668945238047
She rose.	22.43064002953827
Was it goodbye?	18.481843417579654
No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve.	22.28418548181093
She drew herself up to her full height.	18.497670832347406
Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face.	14.842799363263811
She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.	15.495929181947611
Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman.	15.005678469834304
It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed.	13.198326266947285
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because — because Gerty MacDowell was...	13.530055043118514
Tight boots?	25.083686919601174
No. She ’ s lame! O! Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away.	16.612976267166466
Poor girl! That ’ s why she ’ s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint.	19.540573853410674
Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib.	19.999430607667325
Jilted beauty.	23.709650668974525
A defect is ten times worse in a woman.	13.09746085701627
But makes them polite.	16.519737937858082
Glad I didn ’ t know it when she was on show.	18.584638624084917
Hot little devil all the same.	15.670045275408135
I wouldn ’ t mind.	16.671250347692553
Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses.	19.82868125031831
That squinty one is delicate.	15.41956074884626
Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish.	11.771647400845463
I have such a bad headache today.	13.2410924645023
Where did I put the letter?	23.955495679962794
Yes, all right.	20.774049367685404
All kinds of crazy longings.	10.95486566418023
Licking pennies.	22.44972983320617
Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil.	9.676503599134044
Virgins go mad in the end I suppose.	22.337566627108345
How many women in Dublin have it today?	18.015256615434794
Martha, she.	28.769538226314054
Something in the air.	23.855031923671284
That ’ s the moon.	14.120220483323454
But then why don ’ t all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean?	17.674461604351045
Depends on the time they were born I suppose.	26.447896741816642
Or all start scratch then get out of step.	12.931763534477419
Sometimes Molly and Milly together.	14.622930727203459
Anyhow I got the best of that.	23.101504227680795
Damned glad I didn ’ t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter.	14.856265408872229
Made up for that tramdriver this morning.	17.656992598020725
That gouger M ’ Coy stopping me to say nothing.	13.60295134188052
And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe.	19.32180025791364
Thankful for small mercies.	12.021045460915067
Yours for the asking.	34.911416878020646
Because they want it themselves.	19.174349174501668
Their natural craving.	15.131031405535307
Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.	19.059764845042796
Reserve better.	23.66302654126309
Don ’ t want it they throw it at you.	14.995817751014624
Catch em alive, O.	14.279450470540889
Pity they can ’ t see themselves.	17.109794442168486
A dream of wellfilled hose.	12.163362575108561
Where was that?	22.065082184171086
Ah, yes.	14.38540500846543
Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only.	12.746172409140085
Peeping Tom.	23.490633009008263
Willy ’ s hat and what the girls did with it.	24.14991861110799
Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake?	14.168748661032966
_Lingerie_ does it.	18.500712163999953
Felt for the curves inside her <URL> Excites them also when they ’ re.	14.284801306481013
I ’ m all clean come and dirty me.	9.865579770537495
Milly delighted with Molly ’ s new blouse.	18.28033036994827
At first.	24.165165595814138
Put them all on to take them all off.	29.718520592937022
Molly.	27.933989065870424
Why I bought her the violet garters.	15.418686069262131
Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers.	15.180038084865345
He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met.	13.588344393742931
His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what?	9.7851901884741
of jet.	10.759519714587022
Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out.	11.277035400808776
Pinned together.	23.507081911883994
O, Mairy lost the pin of her.	10.461275645085285
Dressed up to the nines for somebody.	18.89017516742476
Fashion part of their charm.	28.125453903881883
Just changes when you ’ re on the track of the secret.	23.72329128972538
Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then.	11.909545557850443
No reasonable offer refused.	11.403356750597695
She wasn ’ t in a hurry either.	19.675452131269545
Always off to a fellow when they are.	26.676269906687264
They never forget an appointment.	13.280008843943422
Out on spec probably.	11.537766140003363
They believe in chance because like themselves.	10.863091626599676
And the others inclined to give her an odd dig.	15.531404710634698
Girl friends at school, arms round each other ’ s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden.	11.488053056235591
Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can ’ t get.	11.547418323812323
Barbed wire.	21.84954169059958
Be sure now and write to me.	17.363782001945758
Now won ’ t you?	16.229629889491957
Molly and Josie Powell.	14.775947065994364
Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon.	15.491502620642384
_Tableau! _ O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all?	26.98502178286211
What have you been doing with yourself?	12.27380809772782
Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you.	16.992838060443184
Picking holes in each other ’ s appearance.	18.755160689436497
You ’ re looking splendid.	11.165341494602627
Sister souls.	25.010145897078058
Showing their teeth at one another.	13.135829977289571
How many have you left?	19.13112594284445
Wouldn ’ t lend each other a pinch of salt.	13.2422802117406
Ah! Devils they are when that ’ s coming on them.	17.886149589870623
Dark devilish appearance.	13.920303695619515
Scratch the sole of my foot.	18.44108679662957
O that way! O, that ’ s exquisite! Feel it myself too.	16.262041588440745
Good to rest once in a way.	17.93991940331937
Wonder if it ’ s bad to go with them then.	21.511899097273137
Safe in one way.	22.88889556100614
Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap.	13.53131578251109
Something about withering plants I read in a garden.	14.74631053390769
Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she ’ s a flirt.	14.729134529236358
Daresay she felt I.	20.537962986423967
When you feel like that you often meet what you feel.	18.429384330708437
Liked me or what?	19.92707876237947
Dress they look at.	21.131770642725566
Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs.	8.924615756778287
Well cocks and lions do the same and stags.	12.895842828535784
Same time might prefer a tie undone or something.	8.115244547591205
Trousers?	48.69846812812113
Suppose I when I was?	22.640489470703702
No. Gently does it.	11.406230838077766
Dislike rough and tumble.	12.368523739759688
Kiss in the dark and never tell.	24.98603986480113
Saw something in me.	24.04703432659442
Wonder what.	22.378282019905892
Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic.	9.101523933154036
To aid gentleman in literary.	12.565470216850168
Ought to attend to my appearance my age.	11.241562362588105
Didn ’ t let her see me in profile.	18.7523967594521
Still, you never know.	25.306927771297293
Pretty girls and ugly men marrying.	10.86236546248624
Beauty and the beast.	27.81213000700393
Besides I can ’ t be so if Molly.	16.378995298618705
Wide brim.	22.959358561719682
Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell.	11.508764533890831
Hair strong in rut.	14.775004992110194
Ten bob I got for Molly ’ s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street.	16.509103067641593
Why not?	17.822852671433534
Suppose he gave her money.	20.508245759362026
Why not?	17.822852671433534
All a prejudice.	13.746625369277496
She ’ s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound.	20.216647128506864
What?	14.617951109062046
I think so.	20.493078427641755
All that for nothing.	22.596529887513654
Bold hand: Mrs Marion.	13.190138961882347
Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn?	16.477189128344257
And the day I went to Drimmie ’ s without a necktie.	19.032982844696647
Wrangle with Molly it was put me off.	19.91839844316971
No, I remember.	21.009552902815187
Richie Goulding: he ’ s another.	23.540348446894793
Weighs on his mind.	27.14926211121108
Funny my watch stopped at half past four.	11.722620389116662
Dust.	43.11253835167618
Shark liver oil they use to clean.	9.42083941326472
Could do it myself.	21.781570394611673
Save.	36.2872409906827
Was that just when he, she?	26.59129513266155
O, he did.	22.222782548671294
Into her.	25.563200476545454
She did.	22.79830808747084
Done.	33.27102489003455
Ah! Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt.	10.991173005941537
O Lord, that little limping devil.	19.330748004682395
Begins to feel cold and clammy.	13.190901545973091
Aftereffect not pleasant.	17.478478579261836
Still you have to get rid of it someway.	23.71649004685478
They don ’ t care.	16.092040823498408
Complimented perhaps.	22.32687063685949
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies.	11.885816619141872
Well, aren ’ t they?	17.23766783627829
See her as she is spoil all.	17.535307941959363
Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.	14.01294302141522
The name too.	18.162615778033153
_Amours_ of actresses.	15.789432175032687
Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe.	10.14055566402654
Curtain up.	24.14549127431132
Moonlight silver effulgence.	16.193248824127593
Maiden discovered with pensive bosom.	12.349422980348113
Little sweetheart come and kiss me.	14.976493887965217
Still, I feel.	23.55501321208175
The strength it gives a man.	13.681898108684022
That ’ s the secret of it.	14.193812880274558
Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam ’ s.	17.401970135694462
Cider that was.	24.312203875256944
Otherwise I couldn ’ t have.	16.094091086049016
Makes you want to sing after.	22.283054644692427
_Lacaus esant taratara_.	12.01962573241864
Suppose I spoke to her.	17.168196278588496
What about?	25.802763627672324
Bad plan however if you don ’ t know how to end the conversation.	13.32317760698245
Ask them a question they ask you another.	17.862719961035534
Good idea if you ’ re stuck.	18.348285920399974
Gain time.	23.247828479675928
But then you ’ re in a cart.	19.9352914129677
O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was.	14.70635876780291
Whew! Girl in Meath street that night.	10.99297801549573
All the dirty things I made her say.	16.85933703322153
All wrong of course.	17.004487906243025
My arks she called it.	12.365922166047957
It ’ s so hard to find one who.	17.43965953101199
Aho! If you don ’ t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden.	14.538812788513528
And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.	16.864462854294903
Parrots.	44.876532221709276
O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That ’ s what they enjoy.	22.428461552225897
Taking a man from another woman.	19.696690180194558
Or even hear of it.	13.688235802995091
Different with me.	20.190555142765557
Glad to get away from other chap ’ s wife.	22.847012153847352
Eating off his cold plate.	19.26969703643117
Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle.	10.660392411368814
French letter still in my pocketbook.	20.534742736545958
But might happen sometime, I don ’ t think.	12.10265134723981
Come in, all is prepared.	25.52564879263325
I dreamt.	24.3045554346112
What?	14.617951109062046
Worst is beginning.	18.035266284103667
How they change the venue when it ’ s not what they like.	16.983875272004827
Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who.	17.5246135074954
Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.	16.549461432197894
Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.	19.970746776795423
Because I did.	21.58185676253588
She too.	22.650795470387546
Offend her.	24.616345292208845
Then make it up.	20.024752577417875
Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake.	13.333144115851976
Flatters them.	23.70032796173972
She must have been thinking of someone else all the time.	16.199651604665743
What harm?	24.775492738405568
Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he.	23.791350129803554
First kiss does the trick.	12.53435450059545
The propitious moment.	15.482319793104734
Something inside them goes pop.	11.463392923730572
First thoughts are best.	13.989604953371737
Remember that till their dying day.	11.708520228566648
Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens.	10.369334335182327
But her breasts were developed.	10.246335375361674
Fell asleep then.	19.095220610210088
After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home.	18.044453579048987
Featherbed mountain.	25.559044363024473
Gnashing her teeth in sleep.	14.313453111454006
Val Dillon.	25.98723371510997
Apoplectic.	44.876532221709276
There she is with them down there for the fireworks.	29.138463303113998
My fireworks.	23.589919311089005
Up like a rocket, down like a stick.	23.11145701419879
And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen.	15.102339468010234
Want to be grownups.	21.816799562415465
Dressing in mother ’ s clothes.	20.645217789356145
Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.	17.65908641584368
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth.	21.467568408823503
I knew she could whistle.	22.65236965495936
Mouth made for that.	21.449565917412627
Like Molly.	23.986254812263844
Would you mind, please, telling me the right time?	19.7346480955134
I ’ ll tell you the right time up a dark lane.	16.18016656841121
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips.	7.975624526534369
Caressing the little boy too.	20.2773230404182
Onlookers see most of the game.	22.713848523706528
Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.	9.91858580171904
In their line.	17.203705636758404
Didn ’ t look back when she was going down the strand.	22.463261773043318
Wouldn ’ t give that satisfaction.	14.272365571693694
Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.	10.628018929848782
Fine eyes she had, clear.	19.491510617407233
It ’ s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil.	16.63262933227974
Did she know what I?	22.839876418604447
Course.	40.27397280315338
Like a cat sitting beyond a dog ’ s jump.	17.11166116498563
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show.	12.765454715135967
Call that innocence?	16.026433740180153
Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.	14.691635918575102
Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_.	13.156289834740104
Eyes all over them.	25.38751047248584
Look under the bed for what ’ s not there.	26.930371483903876
Longing to get the fright of their lives.	17.800601344008065
Sharp as needles they are.	13.11909615085926
When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm.	15.374979525765756
Had, too.	16.998799081783247
Where do they get that?	24.010503802233227
Typist going up Roger Greene ’ s stairs two at a time to show her understandings.	14.739812343208342
Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.	18.543616383142947
Bred in the bone.	32.9370979185624
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing.	14.081967114536578
Best place for an ad to catch a woman ’ s eye on a mirror.	21.376601628015315
And when I sent her for Molly ’ s Paisley shawl to Prescott ’ s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx.	13.129181717807825
I never told her.	20.32129236532211
Attract men, small thing like that.	15.5952838675625
Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red.	23.17438069669917
Who did you learn that from?	23.838669460545983
Nobody.	34.89043401838291
Something the nurse taught me.	12.39678740463748
O, don ’ t they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly ’ s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west.	13.25335802508431
Me have a nice pace.	29.303664122531618
Mullingar.	34.36421338257974
Who knows?	21.69601980486003
Ways of the world.	24.89402879663101
Young student.	17.528190071851277
Straight on her pins anyway not like the other.	19.29693352602866
Still she was game.	26.296944112587646
Lord, I am wet.	28.218130403746127
Devil you are.	21.847924149964598
Swell of her calf.	29.733113352675122
Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.	11.771658795989199
Not like that frump today.	17.53739356914935
A.	12.889029081532971
E.	17.860184031499212
Rumpled stockings.	21.020906256740272
Or the one in Grafton street.	16.969377314464143
White.	39.58715507277716
Wow! Beef to the heel.	19.83566720753727
Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads.	8.277927039065101
And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks.	17.245567032516988
Will she?	26.753864535354204
Watch! Watch! See! Looked round.	10.226898943409006
She smelt an onion.	12.544496199581912
Darling, I saw, your.	29.875844663236734
I saw all.	21.425399742961773
Lord! Did me good all the same.	14.521377741926697
Off colour after Kiernan ’ s, Dignam ’ s.	13.411211458706262
For this relief much thanks.	10.18335726613842
In _Hamlet, _ that is.	16.575997858006406
Lord! It was all things combined.	23.406781235991367
Excitement.	44.876532221709276
When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue.	16.189372487450857
Your head it simply swirls.	10.590228502906324
He ’ s right.	13.23506237186616
Might have made a worse fool of myself however.	13.18125671229352
Instead of talking about nothing.	19.25614546071898
Then I will tell you all.	16.56174539414098
Still it was a kind of language between us.	20.521227926177346
It couldn ’ t be?	21.12707713543525
No, Gerty they called her.	17.83473950833938
Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin ’ s barn a blind.	15.138577925475277
Her maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.	13.504430909079673
Place made me think of that I suppose.	27.54291686728192
All tarred with the same brush.	23.586290842777625
Wiping pens in their stockings.	19.465300327747894
But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood.	20.322196778227916
Every bullet has its billet.	10.993644485790524
Course I never could throw anything straight at school.	11.807197509010416
Crooked as a ram ’ s horn.	29.201257737556926
Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa ’ s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller ’ s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah.	13.765420433392462
No soft job.	18.35745095985683
Saves them.	23.70032796173972
Nature.	43.770624527723555
Washing child, washing corpse.	16.341885788522852
Dignam.	28.61541969695315
Children ’ s hands always round them.	17.92226650105182
Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.	10.388368385047295
Oughtn ’ t to have given that child an empty teat to suck.	13.829273669936377
Fill it up with wind.	25.4818374950734
Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy.	17.962167992646265
Must call to the hospital.	26.698612518144788
Wonder is nurse Callan there still.	10.1765129153439
She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace.	14.395245668125481
That young doctor O ’ Hare I noticed her brushing his coat.	11.331343262835768
And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable.	18.07254601037308
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms.	18.25292581258254
Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.	10.93102140517992
Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.	18.136710428060763
Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night?	17.916572492762867
Chickens come home to roost.	17.71756334540094
They stick by one another like glue.	14.668744904209838
Maybe the women ’ s fault also.	21.576871062320507
That ’ s where Molly can knock spots off them.	9.533684705864127
It ’ s the blood of the south.	18.29136994137319
Moorish.	50.44459592394636
Also the form, the figure.	31.978284798739093
Hands felt for the opulent.	20.662427732458294
Just compare for instance those others.	12.841815848549592
Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard.	20.21822103450117
Allow me to introduce my.	24.218078031533967
Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn ’ t know what to call her.	12.879699948283717
Always see a fellow ’ s weak point in his wife.	23.226507201537505
Still there ’ s destiny in it, falling in love.	22.09750827910345
Have their own secrets between them.	15.248298640230384
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn ’ t take them in hand.	19.25775281773068
Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies.	14.321275019442897
As God made them he matched them.	13.113657214776271
Twice nought makes one.	14.077452630974205
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride.	8.282418902656653
Marry in May and repent in December.	8.69819760688191
This wet is very unpleasant.	13.706362963169076
Stuck.	45.71905876676923
Well the foreskin is not back.	12.162262852853026
Better detach.	19.9430592835314
Ow! Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket.	15.976742016003543
Long and the short of it.	27.559099291406785
Very strange about my watch.	16.304725240241325
Wristwatches are always going wrong.	15.784960233357646
Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he.	20.27519762318513
Yes, I suppose, at once.	19.212945691074978
Cat ’ s away, the mice will play.	27.77495246176251
I remember looking in Pill lane.	12.336968549655644
Also that now is magnetism.	16.131630586363364
Back of everything magnetism.	14.807221168125551
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.	12.563445860342567
That causes movement.	16.556070046037565
And time, well that ’ s the time the movement takes.	18.914802340456202
Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.	10.756895982117452
Because it ’ s all arranged.	20.875001068351366
Magnetic needle tells you what ’ s going on in the sun, the stars.	20.04386784065998
Little piece of steel iron.	18.772615477478162
When you hold out the fork.	19.513833911057922
Come.	22.160365043217414
Come.	22.160365043217414
Woman and man that is.	20.769568722227742
Fork and steel.	16.442068793428213
Molly, he.	27.386293682608663
Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you ’ re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you.	16.803117896487308
Tip.	35.61852722871305
Have to let fly.	20.473612823962238
Wonder how is she feeling in that region.	19.855487790481103
Shame all put on before third person.	14.06842558581848
More put out about a hole in her stocking.	21.44926566839427
Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show.	19.51201078192594
And when the painters were in Lombard street west.	10.620515515260221
Fine voice that fellow had.	21.73624764396177
How Giuglini began.	14.81572848398066
Smell that I did.	30.978907960818834
Like flowers.	24.12304729930308
It was too.	16.723227052902505
Violets.	44.876532221709276
Came from the turpentine probably in the paint.	24.002393322627704
Make their own use of everything.	20.33560375559166
Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn ’ t hear.	11.35614459161459
But lots of them can ’ t kick the beam, I think.	16.79946552029799
Keep that thing up for hours.	19.084771896776807
Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.	19.228987798151174
Wait.	16.144754643793675
Hm. Hm. Yes.	13.653568727461584
That ’ s her perfume.	11.690967504592226
Why she waved her hand.	12.956403721855787
I leave you this to think of me when I ’ m far away on the pillow.	19.05130522046002
What is it?	12.175206074269104
Heliotrope?	44.75790071189311
No. Hyacinth?	15.964555256338588
Hm. Roses, I think.	13.92764973601383
She ’ d like scent of that kind.	21.240335886710938
Sweet and cheap: soon sour.	11.769884427932302
Why Molly likes opoponax.	13.169773950356552
Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed.	24.56946612965993
Her high notes and her low notes.	14.633404699414205
At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours.	19.230700777936264
Heat brought it out.	21.294363800077853
She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before.	23.45009418604884
Good conductor, is it?	16.753980567245314
Or bad?	25.427852132810496
Light too.	23.569118368379023
Suppose there ’ s some connection.	19.550286186936678
Mysterious thing too.	16.56291950637617
Why did I smell it only now?	14.813428728346697
Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure.	9.972983000317097
Suppose it ’ s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across.	12.665432651153305
Yes, it is.	15.404257934742308
Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off.	8.26078565291511
Tell you what it is.	18.866839999365933
It ’ s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they ’ re always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it.	12.985298827836157
Clings to everything she takes off.	12.739462860120236
Warm shoe.	25.344648690617216
Stays.	44.876532221709276
Drawers: little kick, taking them off.	11.628812150766027
Byby till next time.	14.999563807131512
Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed.	14.73712956868461
Know her smell in a thousand.	21.297462287466182
Bathwater too.	22.877819035878947
Reminds me of strawberries and cream.	13.365571152214889
There or the armpits or under the neck.	18.917806282634253
Because you get it out of all holes and corners.	17.862769878830658
Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.	9.293783567406392
Muskrat.	44.876532221709276
Bag under their tails.	19.773431830533823
One grain pour off odour for years.	9.875079128697003
Dogs at each other behind.	17.951621954275787
Good evening.	25.722001542722463
Evening.	44.63448735199276
How do you sniff?	16.568948240998463
Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you.	12.28847826599381
Yes now, look at it that way.	24.97638663649363
We ’ re the same.	15.978091333676758
Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period.	14.116571509459115
Come near.	26.5087165992645
Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.	12.738067228772309
Like what?	24.86687636089378
Potted herrings gone stale or.	11.842929039838138
Boof! Please keep off the grass.	14.52738833013749
Perhaps they get a man smell off us.	19.12833475717306
What though?	25.720179707785913
Cigary gloves long John had on his desk the other day.	18.198099989693098
Breath?	50.137066444060466
What you eat and drink gives that.	10.515957695336775
No. Mansmell, I mean.	14.089844141878567
Must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different.	14.468925452861118
Women buzz round it like flies round treacle.	12.069544526592814
Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost.	26.470937695178055
The tree of forbidden priest.	10.663740446976915
O, father, will you?	19.38317597727615
Let me be the first to.	21.27978606485377
That diffuses itself all through the body, permeates.	13.962940458168951
Source of life.	18.347722716702137
And it ’ s extremely curious the smell.	17.670593216507196
Celery sauce.	21.127791936200214
Let me.	15.966935099859814
Mr Bloom inserted his nose.	15.099969979595558
Hm. Into the.	15.262370763142147
Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.	18.15453114423365
Almonds or.	24.883432166342878
No. Lemons it is.	11.566322570282257
Ah no, that ’ s the soap.	25.680974041072975
O by the by that lotion.	25.74597865296173
I knew there was something on my mind.	21.843415636909615
Never went back and the soap not paid.	22.452913636094948
Dislike carrying bottles like that hag this morning.	13.426042094063277
Hynes might have paid me that three shillings.	17.86107466550308
I could mention Meagher ’ s just to remind him.	15.694673238570736
Still if he works that paragraph.	16.109276786339635
Two and nine.	15.703334933595682
Bad opinion of me he ’ ll have.	22.85705975170453
Call tomorrow.	23.959710095719863
How much do I owe you?	14.916149516744209
Three and nine?	26.700955638094428
Two and nine, sir.	13.915157269654323
Ah. Might stop him giving credit another time.	8.770509194418706
Lose your customers that way.	11.724509571210033
Pubs do.	24.244597676165743
Fellows run up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into somewhere else.	15.499588325451901
Here ’ s this nobleman passed before.	15.33042601633786
Blown in from the bay.	23.28921425038446
Just went as far as turn back.	13.523784521096937
Always at home at dinnertime.	15.44549753807211
Looks mangled out: had a good tuck in.	15.571788773418147
Enjoying nature now.	16.492915152926354
Grace after meals.	15.0281850031791
After supper walk a mile.	12.362778435120571
Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit.	13.364651247312233
Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today.	14.296494482772351
Still you learn something.	16.36944876987293
See ourselves as others see us.	10.74259662673396
So long as women don ’ t mock what matter?	13.882033182447907
That ’ s the way to find out.	16.16923630200003
_The Mystery Man on the Beach_, prize titbit story by Mr Leopold Bloom.	11.098774619042164
Payment at the rate of one guinea per column.	13.065450637803277
Corns on his kismet however.	20.863320930281613
Whistle brings rain they say.	12.059891090137283
Must be some somewhere.	15.086596447640193
Salt in the Ormond damp.	27.266130170758245
The body feels the atmosphere.	13.791616407986172
Mother Shipton ’ s prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the twinkling.	17.419688536395608
No. Signs of rain it is.	11.544500493896324
The royal reader.	15.362226326746233
Howth.	47.69563694271127
Two, four, six, eight, nine.	13.751222490528235
See.	24.911255766279794
Has to change or they might think it a house.	19.98962902942607
Wreckers.	44.876532221709276
Grace Darling.	25.264001888272492
People afraid of the dark.	26.706894942788683
Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time.	7.1778938603307365
Jewels diamonds flash better.	12.717619803742718
Women.	39.04906778630291
Light is a kind of reassuring.	22.26526788630468
Not going to hurt you.	19.70842907841467
Better now of course than long ago.	17.318634723257826
Country roads.	22.44976562170923
Run you through the small guts for nothing.	15.367493742674064
Still two types there are you bob against.	13.884869495092167
Scowl or smile.	17.005768168439303
Pardon! Not at all.	17.51621593165742
Best time to spray plants too in the shade after the sun.	18.16233392996269
Some light still.	17.87919009585957
Red rays are longest.	13.533012432344336
Roygbiv Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.	8.163250265624175
A star I see.	15.356058749227254
Venus?	52.246569120264006
Can ’ t tell yet.	16.531730131050175
Two.	28.11431108355381
When three it ’ s night.	20.53527517480943
Were those nightclouds there all the time?	13.461058741143486
Looks like a phantom ship.	19.689210459811004
Trees are they?	20.804648148095183
An optical illusion.	14.629572371036806
Mirage.	44.876532221709276
Land of the setting sun this.	23.76531374974824
Homerule sun setting in the southeast.	20.737128175154655
My native land, goodnight.	14.911989815846566
Dew falling.	24.21312808075841
Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone.	29.410085252423194
Brings on white fluxions.	12.322950565806787
Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his way up through.	11.423068529596499
Might get piles myself.	12.405195285271045
Sticks too like a summer cold, sore on the mouth.	17.908789074683455
Cut with grass or paper worst.	10.273090034224376
Friction of the position.	41.52629038179392
Like to be that rock she sat on.	16.17395876474886
O sweet little, you don ’ t know how nice you looked.	14.06759346682207
I begin to like them at that age.	19.043563370725284
Green apples.	25.60080163307346
Grab at all that offer.	26.897504748677445
Suppose it ’ s the only time we cross legs, seated.	14.936475252922575
Also the library today: those girl graduates.	9.375264769715145
Happy chairs under them.	13.294299697112104
But it ’ s the evening influence.	19.77817440678742
They feel all that.	21.52139078897016
Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps.	8.329051060385623
Nightstock in Mat Dillon ’ s garden where I kissed her shoulder.	12.664659930642951
Wish I had a full length oilpainting of her then.	17.111519994979737
June that was too I wooed.	25.805714108244047
The year returns.	16.149600627760286
History repeats itself.	18.45198332194625
Ye crags and peaks I ’ m with you once again.	12.315452833176062
Life, love, voyage round your own little world.	12.660537548084912
And now?	23.096770445340724
Sad about her lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity.	18.188788816887016
They take advantage.	17.1393047971848
The distant hills seem.	13.278863344382199
Where we.	25.38386637776137
The rhododendrons.	23.172537237274277
I am a fool perhaps.	14.55579215658097
He gets the plums, and I the plumstones.	15.66472880149966
Where I come in.	18.17916367542111
All that old hill has seen.	16.386210196025562
Names change: that ’ s all.	17.362710724863394
Lovers: yum yum.	11.59213121554472
Tired I feel now.	21.27217578663596
Will I get up?	24.01310430543341
Drained all the manhood out of me, little wretch.	26.30686701720799
She kissed me.	15.696409922588831
Never again.	23.449794603927867
My youth.	25.76400611344396
Only once it comes.	15.43921151664201
Or hers.	23.035708987218708
Take the train there tomorrow.	12.93850021626524
No. Returning not the same.	14.74278408679093
Like kids your second visit to a house.	13.62241771296955
The new I want.	19.877206872272815
Nothing new under the sun.	17.872708452626178
Care of P.	17.23373704461884
O.	16.57850871695433
Dolphin ’ s Barn.	20.4464765965099
Are you not happy in your?	14.237665896932024
Naughty darling.	24.918898995822122
At Dolphin ’ s barn charades in Luke Doyle ’ s house.	12.300122929922
Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy, Hetty.	6.964827929341258
Molly too.	25.46223163562873
Eightyseven that was.	24.33657849974909
Year before we.	21.517733831593382
Curious she an only child, I an only child.	15.417630364235693
So it returns.	17.01110797267447
Think you ’ re escaping and run into yourself.	12.98831968445424
Longest way round is the shortest way home.	14.231713758693662
And just when he and she.	22.89651510940422
Circus horse walking in a ring.	24.5977504543287
Rip van Winkle we played.	11.508201068933694
Rip: tear in Henny Doyle ’ s overcoat.	14.826705236684838
Van: breadvan delivering.	11.8593135734691
Winkle: cockles and periwinkles.	12.280637343058135
Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back.	12.125744428002537
She leaned on the sideboard watching.	22.353113567489803
Moorish eyes.	26.956540599905612
Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow.	10.41282300386774
All changed.	24.11459658977082
Forgotten.	35.36909335234094
The young are old.	14.206307987337889
His gun rusty from the dew.	20.001165633847933
Ba. What is that flying about?	18.37846451844733
Swallow?	44.75790071189311
Thinks I ’ m a tree, so blind.	18.87763731713624
Have birds no smell?	16.024162575677522
Metempsychosis.	52.88728642569826
They believed you could be changed into a tree from grief.	13.709292181395444
Weeping willow.	21.577729785062214
Ba. There he goes.	17.89954102301227
Funny little beggar.	16.57091035268808
Wonder where he lives.	22.538363125449827
Belfry up there.	20.797639631267224
Very likely.	23.874865150196694
Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity.	24.823516415012566
Bell scared him out, I suppose.	19.92765477920742
Mass seems to be over.	24.85933273460602
Could hear them all at it.	24.339971334891416
Pray for us.	21.12105115683649
And pray for us.	13.01420013470877
And pray for us.	13.01420013470877
Good idea the repetition.	12.174052990604784
Same thing with ads.	15.452393370900591
Buy from us.	18.02869945917352
And buy from us.	14.552724160191733
Yes, there ’ s the light in the priest ’ s house.	23.209592377175866
Remember about the mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom ’ s.	19.015566993391868
Twentyeight it is.	20.82381397548193
Two houses they have.	18.473381360993496
Gabriel Conroy ’ s brother is curate.	19.896136706081375
Ba. Again.	16.75084463568942
Wonder why they come out at night like mice.	17.722571695024033
They ’ re a mixed breed.	13.419616809278782
Birds are like hopping mice.	12.140169426306182
What frightens them, light or noise?	16.35380154082187
Better sit still.	17.207770372548225
All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles.	12.709604293259089
Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands.	20.453210965504645
Weeny bones.	22.8459208685078
Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white.	15.47124618310119
Colours depend on the light you see.	20.819338738691773
Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish.	12.565415221624265
Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase.	26.123368386205044
Colour of brown turf.	16.375426286064137
Not true.	24.211877591201347
That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the _City Arms_ with the letter em on her forehead.	15.193242762795089
Body fifty different colours.	13.697635837866512
Howth a while ago amethyst.	13.605736622948644
Glass flashing.	23.167593098777235
That ’ s how that wise man what ’ s his name with the burning glass.	15.20840494229114
Then the heather goes on fire.	12.157030958408576
It can ’ t be tourists ’ matches.	13.406425081295776
What?	14.617951109062046
Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun.	18.17331849018664
Archimedes.	44.876532221709276
I have it! My memory ’ s not so bad.	23.092724336063988
Ba. Who knows what they ’ re always flying for.	15.551014539493094
Insects?	50.137066444060466
Might be the one bit me, come back to see.	24.797245668712726
Birds too.	22.86337488634512
Never find out.	20.893081945356748
Or what they say.	19.733573965217193
Like our small talk.	13.74376867964616
Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back.	20.313822719758463
Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires.	11.385656851330593
Dreadful life sailors have too.	11.114328587670482
Big brutes of oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows.	9.40821606348138
_Faugh a ballagh! _ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow.	11.140081716048426
Married too.	24.139042697690282
Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere.	20.499530781068227
No ends really because it ’ s round.	18.18884001406795
Wife in every port they say.	14.514161747589577
She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again.	11.06554937854108
If ever he does.	21.119780905134647
Smelling the tail end of ports.	13.680782667147156
How can they like the sea?	26.247717595035834
Yet they do.	20.700927631615446
The anchor ’ s weighed.	27.217263952457724
Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck.	18.58139221876193
Well.	29.783458703232462
And the tephilim no what ’ s this they call it poor papa ’ s father had on his door to touch.	14.887942021333505
That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage.	15.252195123521263
Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers.	17.113097150633727
Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that ’ s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him.	14.454084202578068
Do fish ever get seasick?	12.501966533249252
Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones ’ locker, moon looking down so peaceful.	7.7277573797089065
Not my fault, old cockalorum.	17.598140347987265
A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds for Mercer ’ s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars.	8.006659585633134
They floated, fell: they faded.	14.915364194946813
The shepherd ’ s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst.	16.986783902611112
From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o ’ clock postman, the glowworm ’ s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges.	12.794749586418211
And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy ’ s terrace.	10.438870717023942
By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races! _ and from the door of Dignam ’ s house a boy ran out and called.	10.438138389708248
Twittering the bat flew here, flew there.	12.38372587642526
Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey.	11.34052561816713
Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns.	10.786272748668736
He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake.	7.623561538562455
And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.	6.279750635938243
Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot.	16.654243007555785
Irish Lights board.	15.507341941688438
Penance for their sins.	21.224330305293073
Coastguards too.	22.877819035878947
Rocket and breeches buoy and lifeboat.	9.777856669884885
Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the Erin ’ s King, throwing them the sack of old papers.	18.637865443741077
Bears in the zoo.	36.10079727908381
Filthy trip.	22.44976562170923
Drunkards out to shake up their livers.	17.44060684983028
Puking overboard to feed the herrings.	10.456409606055185
Nausea.	44.876532221709276
And the women, fear of God in their faces.	18.317047486025025
Milly, no sign of funk.	21.895801929546167
Her blue scarf loose, laughing.	12.384944937080942
Don ’ t know what death is at that age.	15.437656017812229
And then their stomachs clean.	11.211109898444002
But being lost they fear.	12.353024401049558
When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin.	12.248277088809747
I didn ’ t want to.	12.249343009682343
Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood.	16.657952560933445
Frightening them with masks too.	14.646419166823351
Throwing them up in the air to catch them.	20.135885254596847
I ’ ll murder you.	12.54046670859697
Is it only half fun?	17.877620678376047
Or children playing battle.	13.606081877877859
Whole earnest.	22.449622469408535
How can people aim guns at each other.	9.366759978058973
Sometimes they go off.	21.608005094969638
Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash.	7.548384587048076
After getting better asleep with Molly.	11.930057285594065
Very same teeth she has.	14.427037949754931
What do they love?	20.27002414083397
Another themselves?	25.673904013085405
But the morning she chased her with the umbrella.	20.264559976802765
Perhaps so as not to hurt.	19.92995350121065
I felt her pulse.	17.080128688417798
Ticking.	44.876532221709276
Little hand it was: now big.	21.784913456147954
All that the hand says when you touch.	19.757940087070956
Loved to count my waistcoat buttons.	11.96277302642883
Her first stays I remember.	12.829183462057758
Made me laugh to see.	13.21692974906356
Little paps to begin with.	11.221536680168175
Left one is more sensitive, I think.	14.431587379535651
Nearer the heart?	24.29793826036303
Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me.	10.695992284550096
Frightened she was when her nature came on her first.	24.188406905057224
Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too.	15.105051794301765
Brings back her girlhood.	15.110355339194937
Gibraltar.	47.20896625929803
Looking from Buena Vista.	10.194537252875934
O ’ Hara ’ s tower.	21.33006807560857
The seabirds screaming.	15.37408038054492
Old Barbary ape that gobbled all his family.	10.197859764558846
Looking out over the sea she told me.	18.370542990717833
Evening like this, but clear, no clouds.	23.202649283894203
I always thought I ’ d marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a private yacht.	16.99490027697578
_Buenas noches, señorita.	11.692096527722947
El hombre ama la muchacha hermosa_.	6.636908368598761
Why me?	24.618742749374654
Because you were so foreign from the others.	23.217792920164914
Better not stick here all night like a limpet.	16.10072754990812
This weather makes you dull.	14.026432955588886
Must be getting on for nine by the light.	19.297269190548004
Go home.	23.3552785412152
Too late for _Leah, Lily of <URL> No. Might be still up.	10.436059959304822
Call to the hospital to see.	23.96906782055564
Hope she ’ s over.	20.84111553134778
Long day I ’ ve had.	23.558336233063606
Martha, the bath, funeral, house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus ’ song.	16.18877841974537
Then that bawler in Barney Kiernan ’ s.	7.40561711552236
Got my own back there.	16.906521758689156
Drunken ranters what I said about his God made him wince.	18.455996357041382
Mistake to hit back.	13.33110733283448
Or?	41.89882186794267
No. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves.	15.871202484158296
Always want to be swilling in company.	18.311614620422436
Afraid to be alone like a child of two.	27.69378773206975
Suppose he hit me.	14.740421513134752
Look at it other way round.	20.653538097942732
Not so bad then.	17.939211347222535
Perhaps not to hurt he meant.	19.981899033872114
Three cheers for Israel.	13.340837170552208
Three cheers for the sister - in - law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth.	12.746483937342628
Same style of beauty.	15.108609473415209
Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea.	15.827702842346222
The sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo has just come to town.	19.99536016388081
Imagine that in the early morning at close range.	18.270599963147493
Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow.	14.40042934999777
But Dignam ’ s put the boots on it.	23.162736339600425
Anyhow she wants the money.	15.02756426376939
Must call to those Scottish Widows as I promised.	13.519369945240403
Strange name.	25.60725870105822
Takes it for granted we ’ re going to pop off first.	15.7079391193502
That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer ’ s that looked at me.	14.36916082234685
Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium.	14.520788720962587
Her widow ’ s mite.	26.80818659725732
Well?	29.103223780398952
What do you expect her to do?	19.635794375205297
Must wheedle her way along.	13.081295208222643
Widower I hate to see.	17.07497244064227
Looks so forlorn.	16.55273239477484
Poor man O ’ Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here.	10.699242708710235
The sewage.	21.21532640603095
Some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him.	13.555708978088903
Take him in tow, platter face and a large apron.	17.722292250970636
Ladies ’ grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a pair, astonishing bargain.	10.065950998380254
Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say.	12.074888124664682
Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we die.	10.62000044842146
See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the trick.	10.86103633802593
U.	20.136332872350966
p: up.	11.441832688442634
Fate that is.	21.13291736321378
He, not me.	16.835540682119834
Also a shop often noticed.	12.496675969274332
Curse seems to dog it.	15.66261556113795
Dreamt last night?	21.933203478723815
Wait.	16.144754643793675
Something confused.	19.82776241373545
She had red slippers on.	13.079740522350598
Turkish.	41.97666705394844
Wore the breeches.	18.40549983706579
Suppose she does?	22.179575801837316
Would I like her in pyjamas?	24.11605795232912
Damned hard to answer.	20.529454370419963
Nannetti ’ s gone.	24.48275274513998
Mailboat.	44.876532221709276
Near Holyhead by now.	12.38923647306106
Must nail that ad of Keyes ’ s.	10.689567491665994
Work Hynes and Crawford.	13.600997900943822
Petticoats for Molly.	20.274546429968176
She has something to put in them.	21.658298019709548
What ’ s that?	13.931670922911561
Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand.	20.95583399980658
He brought it near his eyes and peered.	19.71826427482131
Letter?	44.557694839023675
No. Can ’ t read.	17.18487584999956
Better go.	24.409601949805044
Better.	30.21360891000477
I ’ m tired to move.	12.285384346385086
Page of an old copybook.	23.22949032050821
All those holes and pebbles.	11.20133279782357
Who could count them?	14.408030205630569
Never know what you find.	23.97112293449795
Bottle with story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck.	20.310429585027844
Parcels post.	24.286161930786534
Children always want to throw things in the sea.	20.186471440333776
Trust?	44.69076581821027
Bread cast on the waters.	27.063247351376084
What ’ s this?	20.22092106994305
Bit of stick.	16.843286014478817
O! Exhausted that female has me.	10.555526835824596
Not so young now.	17.767335226563006
Will she come here tomorrow?	14.963882199394618
Wait for her somewhere for ever.	20.49391488455146
Murderers do.	24.244597676165743
Will I?	26.555176087839165
Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot.	13.220300975226891
Write a message for her.	14.616338557578175
Might remain.	24.414270068847458
I.	12.415755957110475
Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning.	16.108225277344626
Useless.	42.582853682346894
Washed away.	25.698580236186075
Tide comes here.	17.460713749600686
Saw a pool near her foot.	14.529141687265156
Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs.	18.93942534624688
All these rocks with lines and scars and letters.	8.439900470466789
O, those transparent! Besides they don ’ t know.	11.33748107432966

Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Universally that person ’ s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind ’ s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature ’ s incorrupted benefaction.	7.34826914710473
For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature ’ s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution ’ s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?	7.881588058528523
It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.	13.457670750893623
Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O ’ Shiels, the O ’ Hickeys, the O ’ Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux.	10.447526339783526
Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.	8.184375180776973
To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile.	8.417670910720743
O thing of prudent nation not merely in being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt! Before born bliss babe had.	10.46496544677274

Christ ’ s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch.	12.063208526732256
That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne ’ s house.	9.267125721482369
Loth to irk in Horne ’ s hall hat holding the seeker stood.	10.350971561522968
On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered.	7.045492348318174
Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed.	16.54782823499081
Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked.	13.88712362042846
Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.	10.09009615611213
As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared.	7.095124764803621
Glad after she was that ere adread was.	15.942576032390276
Her he asked if O ’ Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O ’ Hare Doctor in heaven was.	9.616107973185327
Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful.	16.1135433714641
All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God ’ s rightwiseness to withsay.	8.997354954927975
She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men ’ s oil to his limbs.	12.15969161530146
The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness.	11.475597162060025
He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring.	14.271892495298697
So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.	8.634345403001362
Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother ’ s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.	16.100738999516505
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.	22.488276370196843
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be.	16.994744978689987
She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman ’ s birth.	14.35781875049955
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house.	16.588829930031245
The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women ’ s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid.	15.984688831957985
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.	7.748051162552313
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat.	11.768289080559127
And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon.	16.534316003667822
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.	10.46646872176355
And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there.	20.915052516215923
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile.	13.65473304160982
Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.	12.589969313290226
But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle.	11.857137996835613
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.	8.122648894710402
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment.	11.827951999296742
And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously.	9.657059705901661
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles.	16.421585554826823
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer.	8.174482729782302
And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.	9.008800902894794
And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.	12.914294429320172
And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain.	12.782543432584164
And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.	11.936968674118361
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.	6.9987947673608994
And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile.	10.870912521505755
And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile.	17.844048022200877
Thanked be Almighty God.	12.76460132247755
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.	9.581997182819054
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now.	15.70737635250786
Meseems it dureth overlong.	10.23342497954344
And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently.	14.127463328593535
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.	12.235032855903533
And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next.	15.182012523614342
Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both ’ s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness.	16.55278871119113
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars ’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup.	11.67507495345593
Woman ’ s woe with wonder pondering.	17.906315154871702
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might.	21.438261581466193
There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable ’ s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold.	11.94365524185627
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.	13.433558614033586
Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.	13.676889863272876
For they were right witty scholars.	15.976665483464632
And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne ’ s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case).	10.550560451657377
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die.	13.15811486924738
And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy.	10.548433488195725
A redress God grant.	11.618980579960231
This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die.	13.033047131433728
In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack.	9.112942705861297
Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved.	10.244773767488027
To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.	8.524745568263903
Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.	11.416228290736255
But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life?	10.737537057400283
For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.	12.796315683787913
We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.	8.597328210771463
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.	7.398423175184245
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.	15.51723980510459
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi ’ s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do.	10.839768317529533
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever.	12.691153805257615
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides.	10.444998931435999
He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God ’ s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman ’ s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded.	9.452582697720363
All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life.	9.000481910670823
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions.	12.443252477960435
That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word.	18.5897014528916
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.	19.779863887033283
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny.	10.994562724552313
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb ’ s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend ’ s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.	13.4110666622931
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.	10.13470968023244
Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul ’ s bodiment.	12.998474999251703

And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ.	12.989101227085039
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore.	9.710424293520495

No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.	9.187047249497471

Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo, _ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard.	9.392724046362202
It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time ’ s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred.	10.469025385340315

To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar ’ s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.	11.171599898700526
Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.	11.825545345401203
But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin.	15.276335511169595
Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided.	9.561550543197525
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their _Maid ’ s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals.	11.150243233396806

Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it.	15.88016587683892

Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.	10.397629928509899

Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler.	8.320157246352995
Came now the storm that hist his heart.	11.007414752529305
And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry.	8.635083635359003
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm.	12.3528262839234
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour.	12.432519417487788
But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.	13.142610447427813
But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne ’ s hall.	9.081336323770214
He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart ’ s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.	14.938188200496269
But was young Boasthard ’ s fear vanquished by Calmer ’ s words?	14.759424915838071
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other?	18.194121758262877
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either.	20.55030357366882
But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal?	16.048693748922307
Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle.	17.94698482386414
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon?	18.45204565687368
Heard?	44.557694839023675
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done).	17.01223702100611
For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.	17.002992084207634
And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away?	16.812741959719922
By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law.	12.449633689126767
Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe - on - Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it?	11.13354752748281
Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird - in - the - Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two - in - the - Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.	14.737510093867423
For regarding Believe - on - Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two - in - the - Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild.	10.701153547934732
So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer.	12.694312484103746
Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.	13.28110184604051
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.	10.258505946539294
Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won ’ t sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.	7.675402179790151
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without.	11.803581287494568
The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire.	8.383863395755787
All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.	11.527776656448097
But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came.	14.479809981517205
In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke ’ s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first.	9.803106938451789
Over against the Rt. Hon.	12.26343708412471

Mulligan a gentleman ’ s gentleman that had but come from Mr Moore ’ s the writer ’ s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite) chanced against Alec.	16.486656742792544
Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M ’ s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne ’ s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne ’ s.	13.7403760737043
There Leop.	20.922216594127995
Bloom of Crawford ’ s journal sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy ’ s, Vin.	11.014609264651506

Leop.	44.25855057708694
Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can ’ t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue.	15.156104516264163
’ Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick ’ s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king ’ s bible.	15.45926498753188
Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear.	11.897811353589711
In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi ’ s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer ’ s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.	11.184196787218687
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night ’ s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen ’ s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk.	17.597993742229132
He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat.	10.013945468694875
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook ’ s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother ’ s son of them would burst their sides.	13.36452654391324
The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale.	16.570630824886006
Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’ tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague.	17.273159383903987
But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.	20.540721303908224
There ’ s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.	15.010197256555417
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too.	14.22256657569132
One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire ’ s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids ’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge.	11.985697925707116
He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him.	11.570779208246998
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?	18.710477144188634
I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he.	14.756668477557929
I can scarce believe ’ tis so bad, says he.	10.238269184881906
And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low ’ s yard in Prussia street.	8.767360217864015
I question with you there, says he.	20.241452938165043
More like ’ tis the hoose or the timber tongue.	10.225132108888172
Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor ’ s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns.	14.430053409745693
Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.	13.838480994510064
Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop.	13.87603718145782
I conceive you, says Mr Dixon.	18.494303315932356
It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose.	16.976448044980998
True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock.	15.962232430883311
He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.	12.139744078079097
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself.	13.38213466952737
So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer ’ s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly.	16.325901692285246
But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.	15.498738792677218
Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart ’ s content.	15.013035076063558
By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.	14.931748252780189
To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls ’ language and they all after him.	9.988855180011663
Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground.	19.275214775409975
And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he ’ d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry ’ s orders.	12.015602531709055
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I ’ ll meddle in his matters, says he.	15.797917433140457
I ’ ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me.	12.862631832512
But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show.	13.341034704893351
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow ’ s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name.	19.866903914656778
Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls ’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.	14.819584235429755
In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.	17.552780451152177
They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America.	9.97040875892534
Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: _ — Pope Peter ’ s but a pissabed.	18.24246862164593
A man ’ s a man for a ’ <URL> Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars.	14.324101447642708
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell ’ s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.	9.991948025322795
Fertiliser and Incubator.	14.688007725642022
Lambay Island_.	21.460269733513158
His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed.	11.060497718058942
Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon.	20.482773082440914
I make no doubt it smacks of wenching.	9.912457291228172
Come, be seated, both.	16.898813337442988
’ Tis as cheap sitting as standing.	7.338517544155827
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired.	11.199203296657076
It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep.	9.955420233535902
To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party.	8.290944483668106
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural.	10.523212142878334
Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains.	20.722551003020325
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.	9.293943457705403
For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies.	8.502222316788988
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it.	12.026229399275815
They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan ’ s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.	16.463658051069377
His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary ’ s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.	10.712998844940815
Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.	7.432274836961885
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced.	12.613749063976737
The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour.	15.911344605915673
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give?	15.446489058055477
Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne ’ s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman ’ s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.	12.88228512649144
Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.	13.760991831071625
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’ tis pity she ’ s a trollop): There ’ s a belly that never bore a bastard.	9.866399734078252
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.	10.155530708913039
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.	12.85486485662432
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.	12.693988202863986
That you may and very opportunely.	12.603850299533637
There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity.	9.83498759349648
But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things.	17.664409898624385
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.	12.184159526740487
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’ pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.	11.078580004989789
I declare, I was never so touched in all my life.	17.366813338542617
God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours.	10.860929153413341
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.	13.472386154506122
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years.	10.977987800889972
But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.	27.975015052100463
How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.	10.300934960654379
Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish.	14.796269604066676
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it.	13.586817221458348
Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.	14.064393619850062
But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.	14.26033566149475
Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak.	11.082499944658007
A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.	10.995869796458386
Pooh! A _livre! _ cries Monsieur Lynch.	16.85746713935422
The clumsy things are dear at a sou.	12.426752121189574
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.	11.111454984310914
No woman of any wit would wear one.	13.282131558893868
The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath...	16.08169952306321
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.	11.247320315101025
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company.	14.443314088204124
The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry.	9.621208763058535
Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.	18.337828860332273
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I ’ ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you.	10.184871312281945
What, you dog?	26.677758037299725
Have you a way with them?	27.034082046527924
Gad ’ s bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch.	18.958053884623855
Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I ’ m all of a wibbly wobbly.	12.122582489971085
Why, you ’ re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.	13.357030356601122
I knows a lady what ’ s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.	18.013444188285188
The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.	14.318808255008209
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.	17.65678698229432
I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.	10.892936394303085
I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast.	15.357380257678996
I cannot away with them.	18.514731940491785
What?	14.617951109062046
Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours?	18.703142557636337
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay?	11.135904202919331
Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.	12.188284816643051
Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door.	13.122244178488362
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath.	10.300283866104218
Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.	13.383155798022795
To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.	12.938861350991155
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.	8.810436339266017
But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon ’ s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation ’ s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.	14.360469960572697
It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable.	10.38509721270666
To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat.	9.759674264936034
Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.	11.964329176023188
To conclude, while from the sister ’ s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.	15.97356958475247
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.	14.733704109056836
The dressy young blade said it was her husband ’ s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron.	13.893319577757046
I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her.	11.917247339736983
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.	12.511346947332198
’ Slife, I ’ ll be round with you.	12.673559650421346
I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her.	9.511030770872386
All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household.	12.895670765695263
Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest.	8.284285783248343
But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.	12.858899128001818
But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity?	10.562909703235018
Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled?	10.726424103260467
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents?	11.131830915057094
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?	11.040922281471744
Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?	17.193505102165798
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.	14.547396172764397
Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate.	12.684308958130824
He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy ’ s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe ’ s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic.	12.659113874414672
It ill becomes him to preach that gospel.	12.472354788748182
Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare?	13.22790941952293
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life.	8.033670868611582
If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him.	5.372811303809336
His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.	8.628431591852715
The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.	7.775347582399384
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born.	13.106219547041894
When he had betaken himself to the women ’ s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues.	10.312849022923213
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain.	13.50127704373426
The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent.	10.73196235466952
Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king ’ s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt, _ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents — in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations.	9.90578011283301
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.	11.309244125044259
The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human.	11.591169625611208
An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.	12.608912008648586
The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived.	12.259778650533866
It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.	9.518782183755798
Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.	7.731264104134921
Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.	11.341182324559208
But Malachias ’ tale began to freeze them with horror.	10.854831622699061
He conjured up the scene before them.	18.22610487220936
The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared...	13.696248199220426
Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked <URL> Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.	11.44104557298228
I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame.	14.697005604835674
Yes, it is true.	18.80870532843923
I am the murderer of Samuel Childs.	8.650412388843378
And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me.	12.005804305438657
This is the appearance is on me.	19.310370178539998
Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?	13.892785118742134
My hell, and Ireland ’ s, is in this life.	28.50404806812121
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.	14.179483884091825
Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out.	12.907377913445996
In vain! His spectre stalks me.	10.620625169557766
Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.	11.315800337327513
He was gone.	18.030978708189103
Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host.	25.199917647754976
The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_.	10.28641352680913
The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.	10.174901691102093
Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.	9.588223733341753
The mystery was unveiled.	13.116882982485665
Haines was the third brother.	29.39683643182431
His real name was Childs.	16.153259033308757
The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.	14.127613778083452
He drank drugs to obliterate.	10.790709901970374
For this relief much thanks.	10.18335726613842
The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.	13.242577837928433
No soul will live there.	13.787008787672434
The spider pitches her web in the solitude.	13.299883531437937
The nocturnal rat peers from his hole.	14.44861938230191
A curse is on it.	18.124275324414178
It is haunted.	15.343142168303688
Murderer ’ s ground.	28.934937938070217
What is the age of the soul of man?	25.207033269138854
As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood.	12.609337390531827
No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds.	11.883326332775223
A score of years are blown away.	12.861929220269554
He is young Leopold.	14.349445122689735
There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.	15.645133906733864
That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother ’ s thought.	14.87185063893946
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart?	15.296724603329936
But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist.	11.744843091003734
Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons.	16.22796712535089
Who can say?	24.003134259194212
The wise father knows his own child.	14.42504750786153
He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first.	18.156530440199546
Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.	16.520583045261475
Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight.	18.88417451588182
They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat! _) light shall flood the world.	12.601833729466174
Did heart leap to heart?	12.960405241033884
Nay, fair reader.	15.386741509959736
In a breath ’ twas done but — hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk.	8.744477776460426
She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.	21.19770818050486
She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day.	9.0881022763679
No, Leopold.	19.367683354151314
Name and memory solace thee not.	9.780046490881542
That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee — and in vain.	9.347862508803079
No son of thy loins is by thee.	13.296457701303943
There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.	16.949140405672047
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived.	8.56602170795411
A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.	5.182241666619087
She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal.	11.892032926407667
Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.	9.060437262165399
They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.	11.074317292957668
Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.	19.236685201280686
Netaim, the golden, is no more.	35.38086440090671
And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts.	17.32544336018902
Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions.	7.898811467780392
Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_.	10.616710298950203
Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.	8.868777250299802
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.	12.723656029691869
And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven ’ s own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo.	11.059290834137876
And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin.	16.85418247023215
It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.	27.06150820854223
How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer.	11.407251040073266
It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.	8.24557677230904
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee ’ s time.	14.687483548155003
He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus.	6.704269428415368
Where were they now?	20.975414788885875
Neither knew.	24.38653775180308
You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said.	15.223426829805222
Why think of them?	32.18485057167266
If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call?	13.856508526992354
Who supposes it?	15.5750911911801
I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life.	7.566581633963221
He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.	9.046121339731444
That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father.	10.908799627515007
All who wish you well hope this for you.	10.169169893096704
All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos.	12.410238205490632
I heartily wish you may not fail them.	11.773867717679872
O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him.	21.634136420994288
Have no fear.	18.870080753694428
He could not leave his mother an orphan.	15.187905734587343
The young man ’ s face grew dark.	15.547105086624546
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss.	22.655191610968988
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart.	14.436186288566734
Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider ’ s name: Lenehan as much more.	15.31380731690768
He told them of the race.	22.92008699348032
Madden up.	23.34844212629285
She was leading the field.	12.217881879855138
All hearts were beating.	15.869105204202285
Even Phyllis could not contain herself.	13.480988100862795
She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her.	9.627564651124738
All was lost now.	15.022213740063709
Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones.	15.650460967233935
Juno, she cried, I am undone.	27.749844997837954
A tear fell: one only.	13.68937075544035
A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W.	15.445611873111297
Lane.	46.30485281843325
Four winners yesterday and three today.	12.527786311432822
What rider is like him?	17.9141413632029
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.	12.60728109316085
But let us bear it as was the ancient wont.	21.159243117631874
Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh.	18.66197364448752
She is not the filly that she was.	16.705397147513967
Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another.	14.52033472918927
By gad, sir, a queen of them.	19.490515579829697
Do you remember her, Vincent?	21.822189438306797
I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said.	14.28877214961937
How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it.	12.185636216315723
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.	10.415222423937596
In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge.	9.458139434110185
A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.	10.584709342228733
Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together.	10.62130488222349
And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field.	19.584685728656726
Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.	16.803455066168752
The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her.	10.304638833705829
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries.	12.560242628407769
But he had been kind.	20.43313556921397
In going by he had blessed us.	18.081003241298596
The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.	9.85838954086973
If I had poor luck with Bass ’ s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely.	12.25353551706278
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.	14.19046975501341
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.	8.011189259988795
His soul is far away.	17.663589875468308
It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born.	18.24162613082702
Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.	14.409878900413752
Do you not think it, Stephen?	28.402436736344338
Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.	12.927289944315413
The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.	11.012815858598483
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all.	16.553099333492604
The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop.	8.428219313481925
During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton - on - Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone ’ s remark on account of its scarlet appearance.	10.614450871686358
He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before ’ s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.	11.846682473294067
Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.	15.909206251800997
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life.	12.197138771255432
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.	8.033872393542353
The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital.	18.795634449528382
The high hall of Horne ’ s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic.	11.23424817316966
A gallant scene in truth it made.	10.885573098869632
Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.	18.378979235017063
There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom.	9.726259216095269
Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden.	12.17796804679715
The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer ’ s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.	8.27272453798584
Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.	8.653575953355848
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S.	13.823671468603958
Dedalus ’ (Div.	13.097719103384312
Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods.	7.591970223223311
The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can.	11.460160355298388
There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer — at present — such as the first problem submitted by Mr L.	12.791774677582227
Bloom (Pubb.	16.837521366880463
Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.	14.146974801847584
Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both?	7.751334857875445
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature ’ s favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_, of the passive element.	14.758120048769218
The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.	9.03056876328274
It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways.	14.393349960003818
Mr M.	22.964451228891456
Mulligan (Hyg.	15.262242237299139
et Eug.	21.87220493071846
Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.	7.502286731537565
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust.	6.3777365950255005
These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas — these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.	8.994023882964685
Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.	9.463150013490079
Mr J.	19.507639462780354
Crotthers (Disc.	16.144338734363938
Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide.	10.133146635750977
Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative.	9.511385566409189
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions.	13.3023638232663
An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V.	13.343202661633752
Lynch (Bacc.	16.619315771287138
Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature ’ s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.	10.883129297539192
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet ’ s words, give us pause.	9.222550448218314
Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.	10.341787080565702
Mr S.	20.67192665724558
Dedalus ’ (Div.	13.097719103384312
Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.	6.725409137047577
For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother.	8.029318437846623
In a recent public controversy with Mr L.	9.421049285860688

At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.	14.218731635822772
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy <URL> It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor.	9.898299778955408
All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped.	10.373659272550482
She had.	19.494245721764155
She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy.	14.146254059041663
Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene.	16.671107270128278
Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband.	15.477230522004614
And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God ’ s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces.	14.243296758466222
He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch.	14.374515254726022
O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days.	16.409516396569256
God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose.	10.463012378761142
Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer ’ s office, Dublin Castle.	12.084533032988565
And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here.	7.846647357465224
No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina.	12.103455014957174
And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.	13.593400210921871
He knows and will call in His own good time.	11.894526630071029
You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man ’ s part.	10.522247094585035
Sir, to you my hand.	28.91601521147291
Well done, thou good and faithful servant! There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait.	13.88501780994705
He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.	13.001754181905351
Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.	13.975942331879722
Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.	11.722929405460311
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair, _ for the cruder things of life.	13.376778451571303
A scene disengages itself in the observer ’ s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.	13.550054889375277
A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock.	10.944967683695761
And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.	11.032865738013005
A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.	7.781118982670282
He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad look.	11.639914165820432

But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word.	7.404278975661862

Bloom, stifflegged, aging, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.) _ BLOOM: _ (Murmurs lovingly.) _ To be a shoefitter in Manfield ’ s was my love ’ s young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly impossibly small, of Clyde Road ladies.	10.293717528962024
Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.	6.545543382852591

Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce.	7.638443909272868
It will hurt you.	14.460188947083685

You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille with whalebone busk to the diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice.	6.995843683991457
Alice will feel the pullpull.	13.654374042721455

Ho! ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunkleg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne hotel, eh?	9.886464543580368

_ (They move off with slow heavy tread.) _ BLOOM: _ (Blows.) _ Providential you came on the scene.	12.569218512196802
You have a car?...	15.95800102796184
CORNY KELLEHER: _ (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) _ Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet ’ s.	11.860226026568137
Like princes, faith.	14.196859234833783
One of them lost two quid on the race.	19.41129127544134
Drowning his grief.	18.493743247047316
And were on for a go with the jolly girls.	26.61883402323318
So I landed them up on Behan ’ s car and down to nighttown.	19.13049332823016
BLOOM: I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...	14.556720068124253
CORNY KELLEHER: _ (Laughs.) _ Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots.	13.207094778490786
No, by God, says I.	18.473981013139593
Not for old stagers like myself and yourself.	11.14369049197391
_ (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) _ Thanks be to God we have it in the house, what, eh, do you follow me?	12.901902059671496
Hah, hah, hah! BLOOM: _ (Tries to laugh.) _ He, he, he! Yes.	12.89486149167285
Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don ’ t know him (poor fellow, he ’ s laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...	18.637121536186353
_ (The horse neighs.) _ THE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome! CORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen ’ s and I told him to pull up and got off to see.	11.451818800862362
_ (He laughs.) _ Sober hearsedrivers a speciality.	8.385452239988588
Will I give him a lift home?	17.147950221986914
Where does he hang out?	14.014463290550461
Somewhere in Cabra, what?	13.722229419596319
BLOOM: No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.	23.08358756588284
_ (Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars.	14.621155540647663
Corny Kelleher, asquint, drawls at the horse.	11.035651761983727
Bloom, in gloom, looms down.) _ CORNY KELLEHER: _ (Scratches his nape.) _ Sandycove! _ (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) _ Eh! _ (He calls again.) _ Eh! He ’ s covered with shavings anyhow.	13.56404656863576
Take care they didn ’ t lift anything off him.	12.929013650491525
BLOOM: No, no, no.	14.750251478213183
I have his money and his hat here and stick.	24.061635257762656
CORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he ’ ll get over it.	16.426965205988935
No bones broken.	17.39101889543288
Well, I ’ ll shove along.	15.095386981232386
_ (He laughs.) _ I ’ ve a rendezvous in the morning.	10.852857303211731
Burying the dead.	19.602408149460135
Safe home! THE HORSE: _ (Neighs.) _ Hohohohohome.	15.156977472982533
BLOOM: Good night.	14.880413347519598
I ’ ll just wait and take him along in a few...	15.372852377125744
_ (Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it.	14.416231185254459
The horse harness jingles.) _ CORNY KELLEHER: _ (From the car, standing.) _ Night.	13.156234024098968
BLOOM: Night.	18.39990177275555
_ (The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly.	7.394931596243662
The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn.	16.073877627218582
Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom ’ s plight.	13.940570912783874
The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat.	13.605424219430144
Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply.	11.474017397707081
With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done.	10.867050928157513
With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs.	9.533318117502994
The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane.	13.837206397413151
Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand.	11.955389634360621
Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay.	19.06373281983842
The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay.	7.051233433384878
Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen ’ s hat, festooned with shavings, and ashplant, stands irresolute.	17.48430250806572
Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.) _ BLOOM: Eh! Ho! _ (There is no answer; he bends again.) _ Mr Dedalus! _ (There is no answer.) _ The name if you call.	16.171032104280343
Somnambulist.	44.876532221709276
_ (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) _ Stephen! _ (There is no answer.	15.011774517905542
He calls again.) _ Stephen! STEPHEN: _ (Groans.) _ Who?	13.891311311396073
Black panther.	24.456434457255266
_ (He sighs and stretches himself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) _ Who...	9.601088730126884

Fergus now And pierce...	11.121621289146004
wood ’ s woven shade?...	18.695278952437544
_ (He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.) _ BLOOM: Poetry.	11.765534619009614
Pity.	30.820763982103497
_ (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen ’ s waistcoat.) _ To breathe.	13.022240741045577
_ (He brushes the woodshavings from Stephen ’ s clothes with light hand and fingers.) _ One pound seven.	10.586339241299298
Not hurt anyhow.	15.818960696426133
_ (He listens.) _ What?	13.679077954733692
STEPHEN: _ (Murmurs.) _...	8.94004656391564
shadows...	21.52447512917275
the woods...	9.573770898933612
white breast...	15.039116190913822
dim sea.	25.261037256558833
_ (He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body.	12.50820057358345
Bloom, holding the hat and ashplant, stands erect.	15.632005504147411
A dog barks in the distance.	22.704934166629712
Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant.	12.889767856766301
He looks down on Stephen ’ s face and form.) _ BLOOM: _ (Communes with the night.) _ Face reminds me of his poor mother.	16.664635802443026
The deep white breast.	13.817450950529045
Ferguson, I think I caught.	24.48248851379611
A girl.	24.11266292074997
Some girl.	24.93036175862951
Best thing could happen him.	12.229248053503374
_ (He murmurs.) _...	8.634732928438597
swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts...	9.525613480568655
_ (He murmurs.) _...	8.634732928438597
in the rough sands of the sea...	19.348820431489997
a cabletow ’ s length from the shore...	15.1478367237287
where the tide ebbs...	14.341951169330512
and flows...	10.289745186588393
_ (Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master.	13.491835953929465
Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand.	13.050156466828138
He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.) _ BLOOM: _ (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) _ Rudy! RUDY: _ (Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom ’ s eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling.	10.154223364476003
He has a delicate mauve face.	12.59761049371277
On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons.	11.454088614863196
In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot.	11.678360855111201
A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.) _ Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.	10.919619669654104
His (Stephen ’ s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman ’ s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral.	12.758499336327457
But how to get there was the rub.	24.711882815666367
For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned.	9.748737439876397
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier ’ s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin ’ s.	11.88063371977859
But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.	11.003543566905789
This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did.	17.879849179049245
So, bevelling around by Mullett ’ s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance.	13.538339862742765
So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey.	10.565064766594432
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company ’ s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back.	12.114797558123641
They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.	10.713961665295386
Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird ’ s the stonecutter ’ s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke ’ s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable.	12.02909122331336
Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke ’ s the baker ’ s it is said.	18.06289722946252
_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn ’ t look out.	12.386079556946447
Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about.	14.334366723476274
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot.	13.780894821656771
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes.	14.348795649409862
Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything.	7.974853527896667
You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £.	16.217630354544177
s.	12.523224119318451
d.	28.391872566554706
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically.	10.650530645539344
Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.	16.15513632292375
— And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.	15.919878302456864
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps.	10.312410951664612
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox.	14.749505128596594
He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father ’ s, Gumley.	12.409318273001457
To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.	18.332062304323404
— Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.	11.538229107888116
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling: — Night! Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment.	12.214738547633154
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least.	9.27495973297372
Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment ’ s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.	9.669335289149304
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley ’ s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice.	13.831231148791629
Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise.	15.795290297457141
His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.	8.250105019440394
Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen.	13.354841327763447
This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.	7.8905828062652255
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.	12.234081725664307
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night ’ s lodgings.	18.10647446820177
His friends had all deserted him.	11.22798346781861
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions.	16.002592772473726
He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God ’ s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do.	16.973932035462763
No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn ’ t a complete fabrication from start to finish.	17.172663541087005
Anyhow he was all in.	30.65368966097044
— I wouldn ’ t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I ’ m on the rocks.	14.793758048206543
— There ’ ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys ’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher.	17.59879905483936
Try it.	19.62523547066614
You may mention my name.	13.537198891917482
— Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn ’ t teach in a school, man.	16.408530537230043
I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.	22.813697346315738
I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers.	22.338849008252033
— I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.	16.162109238527883
Corley at the first go - off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street.	15.574298274367711
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney ’ s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M ’ Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob.	12.727570577872253
He was starving too though he hadn ’ t said a word about it.	12.63409845214069
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen ’ s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley ’ s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence.	14.15821798064506
However _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished.	11.348655529870719
But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley ’ s head that he was living in affluence and hadn ’ t a thing to do but hand out the needful.	16.814780790930218
Whereas.	45.71905876676923
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing.	15.149901377956677
A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.	18.662866031593655
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact.	13.230826822588105
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.	9.643298249495453
About biscuits he dimly remembered.	9.74556657045145
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy.	13.36096200732881
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.	15.02971226756675
— Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.	10.477913748079922
And so in point of fact they turned out to be.	14.251860751253286
Stephen anyhow lent him one of them.	18.567135460004817
— Thanks, Corley answered, you ’ re a gentleman.	15.730625551569625
I ’ ll pay you back one time.	11.005210538336033
Who ’ s that with you?	22.932141755830845
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.	17.463737339834932
You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there.	17.365602013296925
I ’ d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they ’ re full up for the next three weeks, man.	17.370001461951475
God, you ’ ve to book ahead, man, you ’ d think it was for the Carl Rosa.	18.314687759990367
I don ’ t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.	13.806671292321381
Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.	12.72178358327756
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman ’ s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept.	12.572040743021818
He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen ’ s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.	12.342265065540905
Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity.	9.099648218952579
Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether.	18.256334329027997
In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.	13.124839773650226
Pretty thick that was certainly.	24.90607942818709
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite.	18.31855552964049
Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is: — He is down on his luck.	25.64743638972257
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.	21.578444023081914
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively: — Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say.	11.671698065267158
Now you mention it his face was familiar to me.	14.368756455770706
But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?	19.039592078115703
— Half a crown, Stephen responded.	18.935150146596417
I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.	13.74849459110992
— Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does.	11.891580135349356
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds.	16.41028876882555
But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself?	15.705702376700081
Walking to Sandycove is out of the question.	16.157587141817192
And even supposing you did you won ’ t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station.	11.756725600513048
Simply fag out there for nothing.	17.721293876814357
I don ’ t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father ’ s house?	12.370507175162125
— To seek misfortune, was Stephen ’ s answer.	16.09822540528901
— I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday.	13.694092482097357
Where does he live at present?	15.066744801124528
I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.	21.131444758623772
— I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.	19.82126236608817
Why?	18.457368458488407
— A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one.	14.617408040971188
He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you.	11.24471710577944
You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.	15.163108677010246
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen ’ s mind ’ s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that.	13.163169414034789
— No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn ’ t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes.	11.957130835498877
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.	10.827335564178826
Of course you didn ’ t notice as much as I did.	14.33954012520318
But it wouldn ’ t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.	12.540625470147463
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.	11.702726956107544
— Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.	16.746832364292903
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen ’ s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less.	10.714570907748577
Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.	11.84584205835802
Adjacent to the men ’ s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.	9.908106550868611
— _Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione?	5.428367534807921
Culo rotto! _ _ — Intendiamoci.	18.67791087142988
Mezzo sovrano più... _ _ — Dice lui, però! _ _ — <URL> _ — Farabutto! Mortacci sui! _ _ — Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più... _ Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman ’ s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin - the - Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in.	11.849116724191441
A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.	7.349673395783876
— Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.	12.450967162073272
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly.	8.399189879366535
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.	7.070154171511938
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious: — A beautiful language.	13.918208301689392
I mean for singing purposes.	12.016631184748352
Why do you not write your poetry in that language?	17.54947021691533
_Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious and full.	12.704232930355719
_Belladonna.	44.876532221709276
<URL> Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied: — To fill the ear of a cow elephant.	13.4841147014843
They were haggling over money.	10.090010994429248
— Is that so?	14.91078277899429
Mr Bloom asked.	11.735074165646148
Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.	8.913583808713135
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête - à - tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.	14.604197758256978
After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to.	15.435043246064856
For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.	10.811592642620232
— Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names.	14.556710271491834
Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody.	12.93909283621326
Jesus, Mr Doyle.	32.84600915360247
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies.	12.095903740562042
What ’ s in a name?	19.273888821426187
— Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred.	14.697067453864335
Of course.	17.3039069864022
Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.	13.306304979704782
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking: — And what might your name be?	11.976662753209581
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion ’ s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered: — Dedalus.	14.805661032946853
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.	9.90331260943759
— You know Simon Dedalus?	17.78978716100369
he asked at length.	12.516030683096721
— I ’ ve heard of him, Stephen said.	13.755565897898508
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.	14.9397860850488
— He ’ s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding.	15.179091120615931
All Irish.	25.106785031549705
— All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.	18.20030710822493
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark: — I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder.	14.2310673532475
The lefthand dead shot.	11.728492302360127
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.	13.994666025888641
— Bottles out there, say.	17.04645046884245
Fifty yards measured.	15.984678609475294
Eggs on the bottles.	38.580987632199836
Cocks his gun over his shoulder.	11.88410275230506
Aims.	44.876532221709276
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely.	12.766011702363521
Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.	10.26683125254941
— Pom! he then shouted once.	14.716885717320599
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.	8.003499231274164
— Pom! he shouted twice.	14.274215261135353
Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily: _ — Buffalo Bill shoots to kill, Never missed nor he never <URL> A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness ’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.	9.24972642914899
— Long ago?	19.856025002732302
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.	8.453019257165908
— Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years.	14.75288770785895
He toured the wide world with Hengler ’ s Royal Circus.	11.487265378232651
I seen him do that in Stockholm.	21.02318281434733
— Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.	13.059460247886111
— Murphy ’ s my name, the sailor continued.	23.943136931015935
D.	18.383350212219998
B.	17.785236174055573
Murphy of Carrigaloe.	16.084947815829032
Know where that is?	27.551590393993347
— Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.	17.589567402587324
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle.	10.80970063884146
That ’ s where I hails from.	11.030010769822546
I belongs there.	18.08945762400884
That ’ s where I hails from.	11.030010769822546
My little woman ’ s down there.	18.191419544947976
She ’ s waiting for me, I know.	23.78571323872886
_For England, home and beauty_.	15.135167123113815
She ’ s my own true wife I haven ’ t seen for seven years now, sailing about.	11.95286797457416
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner ’ s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon.	13.484271375575256
Across the world for a wife.	25.5120297181318
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O ’ Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.	9.362651203739699
Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee.	17.71985940413581
The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections.	11.713305188727043
You little expected me but I ’ ve come to stay and make a fresh start.	15.228422276117673
There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside.	16.546915248768997
Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep.	23.561116942812024
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions.	12.434741623912707
No chair for father.	14.063331908745514
Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, _post mortem_ child.	10.322588534855974
With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable.	13.555057926047265
Grin and bear it.	14.479271969629178
I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W.	8.12854627511813
B.	17.785236174055573
Murphy.	41.44050705476043
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request: — You don ’ t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?	18.740655437868345
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.	15.328666247696743
— Thank you, the sailor said.	16.276689384377356
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded: — We come up this morning eleven o ’ clock.	14.149767471892657
The threemaster _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	7.425496340020814
I shipped to get over.	19.491997884853685
Paid off this afternoon.	16.537857481310745
There ’ s my discharge.	16.35023261320567
See?	30.864752701668255
D.	18.383350212219998

B.	17.785236174055573
S.	16.596153063908286
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.	10.40882892954224
— You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.	18.60257595616594
— Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I ’ ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on.	13.408430409789233
I was in the Red Sea.	18.222456047809818
I was in China and North America and South America.	9.711052762291983
We was chased by pirates one voyage.	8.118083899851264
I seen icebergs plenty, growlers.	9.344715433246773
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship.	15.350304956489937
I seen Russia.	16.733707237766097
_Gospodi pomilyou_.	19.698768402221454
That ’ s how the Russians prays.	13.330483769338342
— You seen queer sights, don ’ t be talking, put in a jarvey.	12.751535901711216
— Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.	14.018545927480787
I seen queer things too, ups and downs.	11.162310683050562
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.	10.740493361169545
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously: — Khaan! Like that.	11.984036489184883
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses.	9.871862916158436
Look here.	23.02751683107566
Here they are.	22.410399615214505
A friend of mine sent me.	15.805063005963898
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.	11.923875355242801
The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios.	9.805291250810592
Beni, <URL> All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.	7.908806143088475
— Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added.	11.629220493202565
Stomachs like breadgraters.	14.716109916528309
Cuts off their diddies when they can ’ t bear no more children.	15.182304023464162
See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse ’ s liver raw.	11.621797053230702
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more.	7.421783006249376
— Know how to keep them off?	21.48269797374639
he inquired generally.	14.077856111549643
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying: — Glass.	10.692096545134888
That boggles ’ em.	11.489551954828162
Glass.	39.11487086926779
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.	8.615412191079793
It ran as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, <URL> There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.	7.627504914737449
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo - Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which occasion the former ’ s ball passed through the latter ’ s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict <URL>. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend ’ s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.	10.29039224058338
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through.	10.688823294371938
But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd ’ s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.	12.693274661091655
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with.	10.325489497042017
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.	8.85804800334697
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M ’ Coy type lend me your valise and I ’ ll post you the ticket.	11.183349945002528
No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy - Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody - Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure.	9.229554503105286
That was the rub.	17.39654114506025
Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard - Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally.	12.978298861651249
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.	10.563081938648072
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn ’ t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d ’ œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O ’ Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men ’ s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour ’ s run from the pillar.	9.840010827970989
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired.	13.768809882626392
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact.	11.631665921195676
He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.	18.900420285579354
— I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different.	12.53623129043935
One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower.	23.970342473433007
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.	18.594782530540478
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.	10.93353926392886
— And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.	14.057853200338606
Knife in his back.	28.557415346722713
Knife like that.	21.266732258706153
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.	10.505660169019245
— In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.	14.881980257700672
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.	17.89559681380094
Like that.	17.041964513101775
_Prepare to meet your God_, says he.	11.2287211657079
Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.	25.743677486393874
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to.	7.333812943345384
— That ’ s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable _stiletto_.	10.853173970804596
After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.	7.624728910492952
— They ’ re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all.	17.058342361004232
That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.	14.053529509996729
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin - the - Goat, _alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair.	11.574376980168717
His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn ’ t understand one jot of what was going on.	11.434830191659467
Funny, very! There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.	9.634966994096496
Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.	14.712717190080049
He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.	12.580219313616611
— Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.	15.802154969463801
Give us back them papers.	13.207829704122126
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.	10.283840835778681
— Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar?	12.200249581476447
Mr Bloom inquired.	18.040876507429555
The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no.	14.444105729837064
— Ah, you ’ ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.	14.497138150370086
— What year would that be about?	13.896512421405433
Mr B interrogated.	18.5406636029544
Can you recall the boats?	12.671007062480538
Our _soi - disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering: — I ’ m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.	11.655023289269334
Salt junk all the time.	14.19657995511435
Tired seemingly, he ceased.	25.16007204921767
His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves.	13.697286961312654
On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings.	11.340826843471213
And it left him wondering why.	11.405700520608471
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.	16.406773552461324
And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all.	12.814712513795168
Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.	12.083011575741056
— There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman ’ s valet at six quid a month.	13.212775785684872
Them are his trousers I ’ ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.	20.14065661146788
I ’ m game for that job, shaving and brushup.	10.967692584703174
I hate roaming about.	14.059678372802042
There ’ s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper ’ s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.	15.675569803745033
— What age is he?	14.042070590041787
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.	12.514879191696677
— Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?	16.603083951440322
He ’ d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.	12.725719060262763
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor.	9.420591065891642
— There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.	13.140785665795438
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.	12.672063431766894
It ’ s them black lads I objects to.	8.589803513491981
I hate those buggers.	13.84710054081598
Suck your blood dry, they does.	14.075606514790419
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner ’ s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <NUM> and a young man ’ s sideface looking frowningly rather.	17.003996668089304
— Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.	18.5150921889062
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.	10.857174731850918
Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that.	17.722304218581613
There he is himself, a Greek.	28.2004489086225
one asked the sailor.	13.99030760802432
That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.	12.217067488851944
Someway in his.	26.561393459182295
Squeezing or.	24.883432166342878
— See here, he said, showing Antonio.	20.138542520425013
There he is cursing the mate.	12.64415227638949
And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.	20.075055126586292
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio ’ s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin - the - Goat, who this time stretched over.	9.375818625049693
— Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.	12.089972934339231
He ’ s gone too.	14.300532645358734
Ate by sharks after.	12.605372387256581
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.	13.527971568452443
— Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.	15.188991594632057
— And what ’ s the number for?	17.102256810433687
loafer number two queried.	14.12042851078868
a third asked the sailor.	12.065808578541043
— Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number.	14.914451010527548
Ate.	44.25662045647404
A Greek he was.	18.90736646695047
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.	13.242235763812333
Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink.	17.743591840082235
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of his washing.	16.235016318286565
Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing.	10.985550801636226
Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife ’ s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man ’ s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper ’ s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt.	13.143999067864586
Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female ’ s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off.	16.69061951637686
Round the side of the _Evening Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy ’ s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.	11.774350114958388
— The gunboat, the keeper said.	17.757625483883988
— It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least.	12.421573920588326
Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.	12.530067424865928
Still no matter what the cause is from...	15.778970044083096
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking: — In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade.	11.972914650912308
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul.	11.509380338394175
She is a bad merchant.	24.57397990215372
She buys dear and sells cheap.	9.642922552071154
The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start.	14.861488646021142
Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.	11.189060875872674
— You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul.	20.79417887676757
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup.	17.417217066825977
I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter.	18.56205533573721
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance.	10.502189735846583
Do you?	18.85358719058383
Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say: — They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible.	14.578529398730586
It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette.	11.261980814646392
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining: — Simple?	12.571779710119694
I shouldn ’ t think that is the proper word.	21.946378711027048
Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon.	17.34466284430016
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it ’ s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.	16.516394455737156
— O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.	11.037025478268417
On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.	11.232835263742603
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief.	14.955786303757487
I ’ m not so sure about that.	12.339940860031964
That ’ s a matter for everyman ’ s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_ there.	16.291403230432476
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it ’ s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn ’ t tell you.	13.382183724341692
Can ’ t you drink that coffee, by the way?	16.37911806724272
Let me stir it.	13.972654779468527
And take a piece of that bun.	26.13009233662816
It ’ s like one of our skipper ’ s bricks disguised.	19.368012481903545
Still no - one can give what he hasn ’ t got.	17.027631188532535
Try a bit.	22.059972960745547
— Couldn ’ t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.	17.17076881247988
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders.	8.675308158447438
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying.	12.865684110319584
The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of.	15.567299585271618
Sulphate of copper poison SO<NUM> or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn ’ t remember when it was or where.	12.287539078430632
Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble ’ s Vi - Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.	11.109043739360713
— Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.	18.319271174348497
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.	13.314522582103427
— Still it ’ s solid food, his good genius urged, I ’ m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental or manual.	11.295127109017608
You ought to eat more solid food.	12.854344775426775
You would feel a different man.	14.947799183123477
— Liquids I can eat, Stephen said.	12.692845318655
But O, oblige me by taking away that knife.	14.519176786384941
I can ’ t look at the point of it.	18.445152545967417
It reminds me of Roman history.	14.501297451355809
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.	10.653548557560601
— Our mutual friend ’ s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_.	12.002699317662936
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots.	9.22618659405969
Look at him.	17.30651066599367
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.	12.679796007125113
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.	14.519522873136859
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.	9.276946967182726
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described.	11.448339522844726
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera.	8.226644117979623
And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn ’ t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.	10.20376085595927
— Mind you, I ’ m not saying that it ’ s all a pure invention, he resumed.	18.736077931432828
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.	11.802618163346681
Giants, though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen.	15.116514188535849
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn ’ t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods.	11.905037381043982
There ’ s an example again of simple souls.	11.440154024990964
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded.	11.025039162497475
On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.	10.42119448689791
— Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen.	11.820567038341895
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.	17.124636218678877
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is.	15.84233275315596
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, <URL>. Gibraltar.	11.014651371261557
She has the Spanish type.	19.45191061016293
Quite dark, regular brunette, black.	13.579419335268364
I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character.	8.271063001325002
That ’ s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.	14.430874472163515
— The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings.	14.24568725588917
_Roberto ruba roba sua_.	8.646868582609445
— Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.	16.5653473016209
— Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.	9.466944364500094
— It ’ s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.	15.066293849130833
All are washed in the blood of the sun.	17.909274165959786
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there.	14.8454680797602
The splendid proportions of hips, bosom.	9.268519512391297
You simply don ’ t knock against those kind of women here.	13.946395256258102
An exception here and there.	13.761530404998641
Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I ’ m talking about is the female form.	20.08802016328844
Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman ’ s natural beauty, no matter what you say.	15.12777146182295
Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it ’ s a thing I simply hate to see.	16.036978173893306
Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.	13.000485081320962
Shipahoy of course had his own say to say.	22.597884609223268
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.	15.13818352435553
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt ’ s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand.	12.402415734905654
That was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror.	11.347470785686946
Then someone said something about the case of the s.	19.186070135392832
s.	12.523224119318451
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck.	10.205945096271842
No aid was given.	17.51819389696991
Her master, the _Mona_ ’ s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.	17.87186509967048
She had no water, it appears, in her hold.	25.812167337421407
At this stage an incident happened.	9.86048538687245
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.	10.086391864082236
— Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.	12.777487303386163
He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left.	15.723924993966394
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship ’ s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise.	14.370860422131162
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.	11.81617533112517
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.	12.157577266705658
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.	7.045115397524113
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ <NUM> a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.	10.417331571090292
And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver.	11.581020081431756
He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if — a big if, however — he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.	14.58151390966107
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing.	10.769172597845522
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year.	12.279016161257534
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.	8.957456483899527
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh?	9.799382391536533
Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day ’ s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.	15.90773566511127
— Am I right, skipper?	15.600278998867017
he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.	19.77891928205748
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds.	11.984189476612158
Mr Bloom ’ s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question.	14.31693270389731
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation - _cum_ - potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook: — The biscuits was as hard as brass And the beef as salt as Lot ’ s wife ’ s arse.	10.393703467729175
Skin - the - Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible - feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God ’ s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein.	11.791701209340829
Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact.	15.36088004759149
You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.	13.385815973212276
But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes.	11.54416814962501
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.	21.573389105858727
The Boers were the beginning of the end.	21.5524070085981
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot.	13.570303970958355
His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.	13.688389212791671
Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.	21.328765290829693
Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_.	16.278353215781852
The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.	6.352617344817227
— Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.	9.502124599355868
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.	10.145220653303788
— Who ’ s the best troops in the army?	18.49895370189726
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated.	5.353614912038351
And the best jumpers and racers?	11.103089465515188
And the best admirals and generals we ’ ve got?	12.323592704503888
Tell me that.	24.529817033515474
— The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.	8.635641653554273
— That ’ s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.	15.679694542044057
The Irish catholic peasant.	13.651909465479857
He ’ s the backbone of our empire.	13.091400193677554
You know Jem Mullins?	11.429616247266978
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.	10.327242390262935
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn ’ t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.	11.491581022629283
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.	11.005625270521362
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart.	15.357587911809278
Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact.	12.400814294425965
And now, why?	24.411389743860553
So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.	18.26073272603107
And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn ’ t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn ’ t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen ’ s evidence or king ’ s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.	13.612992701421396
Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.	9.69609495901925
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin - the - Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.	12.698019665044468
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin - the - etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.	14.434978786122683
He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.	12.213293087489973
Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.	7.9748049867891195
Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.	17.68416666900747
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £.	12.092492442284588
s.	12.523224119318451

in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin and so on.	16.55228370104421
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.	15.694462881904157
— He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.	15.159153516051362
He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively.	19.416528178364956
So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I ’ m not.	16.420507378472124
A soft answer turns away wrath.	10.073299143338716
He hadn ’ t a word to say for himself as everyone saw.	16.327243084492444
Am I not right?	17.115868543798072
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn ’ t all exactly.	13.601757128066634
— _Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any other, _secundum carnem_.	10.067835176341669
— Of course, Mr B.	20.16640061090438
proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question.	19.94334620745362
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves.	10.578974522367787
But with a little goodwill all round.	20.697493954509408
It ’ s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.	8.528166081654742
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form.	8.122021162863327
It never reaches anything or stops anything.	9.104667028357696
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan.	14.766113112453723
It ’ s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak.	13.449376122986978
— Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes ’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner ’ s alley and Ormond market.	9.07540739628813
And the whole world was full of that sort of thing.	18.037710859489113
— You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.	19.760101744867093
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn ’ t remotely...	7.632474920912946
All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.	11.155770813539487
— They accuse, remarked he audibly.	8.503327443250207
He turned away from the others, who probably … and spoke nearer to, so as the others … in case they … — Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen ’ s ear, are accused of ruining.	13.813325670511
History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them.	9.715502021873377
Why?	18.457368458488407
Because they are imbued with the proper spirit.	21.34745540654081
They are practical and are proved to be so.	13.204952448976208
I don ’ t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are.	13.548293847409441
But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty.	12.808565525105731
Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America.	21.472563099628392
Turks.	51.98932121274747
It ’ s in the dogma.	18.764516317207686
Because if they didn ’ t believe they ’ d go straight to heaven when they die they ’ d try to live better, at least so I think.	15.675417232427744
That ’ s the juggle on which the <URL>. ’ s raise the wind on false pretences.	14.136655720727427
I ’ m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ <NUM> per annum.	10.442502547379036
That ’ s the vital issue at stake and it ’ s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man.	9.952793814068173
At least that ’ s my idea for what it ’ s worth.	22.180838686114146
I call that patriotism.	18.152592522975826
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_.	7.958701191444104
Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.	24.134903105020616
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.	13.374766508030955
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to.	12.257779711174884
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn ’ t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.	19.336150854460744
— Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.	14.382413170977472
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem.	12.913192484322321
observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.	18.2272725581843
— I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense.	14.355097477786153
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing.	15.893151555724087
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.	16.21192039347194
That ’ s work too.	14.647631314546471
Important work.	23.5756891019294
After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price.	15.935939070254301
You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.	13.139783614743223
What?	14.617951109062046
You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.	23.71951281427085
Each is equally important.	13.628889705281674
— You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called Ireland for short.	14.325809581423378
— I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.	15.007797047842462
— But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.	14.651714990365788
— What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension.	10.275573343428917
Excuse me.	20.89038241047197
What was it you...?	23.247384262598604
Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: — We can ’ t change the country.	10.090511868369703
Let us change the subject.	16.286821235987148
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn ’ t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry.	13.164309514110274
The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part.	14.006743718601525
Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state.	13.399113335836883
Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn ’ t been familiarised with the right sort of people.	12.857687080983556
With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves.	11.526736035936523
For instance there was the case of O ’ Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact).	11.123911059535505
And then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.	10.638439850682946
Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it.	13.276558467944204
Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental.	11.522939672763295
However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps.	19.864271279789623
Sheer force of natural genius, that.	12.517527702782006
With brains, sir.	15.321642856927587
For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it.	13.100061249594575
Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small.	5.624453143505584
Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind.	19.40933863564638
Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz.	13.230399856250541
coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the microscope lately.	12.454163675508749
To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column.	10.924202655247107

Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though as the event turned out the poor fool hadn ’ t much reason to congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope.	13.582793538059653
Guesswork it reduced itself to eventually.	10.795673221678049
— There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.	16.447247131251626
— Who?	12.787285610070553
the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.	14.397474799342685

Dead he wasn ’ t.	13.208723190926051
Simply absconded somewhere.	13.939389383984171
The coffin they brought over was full of stones.	11.350358173016634
He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general.	15.646109252205306
He made a mistake to fight the priests.	12.75050718211982
And so forth and so on.	13.552654433114103
All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years.	12.971598741099026
Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered.	18.278860511590562
Something evidently riled them in his death.	18.483919267948046
Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands.	8.809677965700223
Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility.	9.202660397847993
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren ’ t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between.	12.65221380242885
It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging.	14.034885601523515
And the identical same with murderers.	9.753462625179772
You had to come back.	23.431346458258474
That haunting sense kind of drew you.	13.467162048160729
To show the understudy in the title _rôle_ how to.	14.866832624405456
He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_ or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what ’ s bred in the bone.	14.029752203560545
Still as regards return.	12.932538143362974
You were a lucky dog if they didn ’ t set the terrier at you directly you got back.	11.438311226012392
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against.	8.8728386001235
And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat ’ s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or some such commonplace remark.	15.143957390352012
A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.	16.513324760328924
— That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented.	16.095031383742192
She put the first nail in his coffin.	25.101164311467787
— Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi - disant_ townclerk Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her.	15.747285904789184
She loosened many a man ’ s thighs.	19.383924334120213
I seen her picture in a barber ’ s.	16.685527938064673
The husband was a captain or an officer.	18.531592300296957
— Ay, Skin - the - Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.	10.970300531219657
This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_.	10.287181845626113
As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings.	14.314738341857085
First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into.	11.098695345531928
Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of.	12.699440379015817
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one ’ s smiles.	16.796618986745965
Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk?	13.16792060737382
Poser.	44.876532221709276
Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly.	11.733223155543739
A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the <NUM> th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass ’ s kick.	13.322125347964892
Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream.	14.807082101840143
And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times.	15.148940185974592
Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side.	16.15761549011579
North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn ’ t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.	11.023516014204308
— Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun.	19.57842924476881
And, if I don ’ t greatly mistake she was Spanish too.	15.09550556590488
— The king of Spain ’ s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.	11.110280978264246
— Was she?	17.53128099529575
Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour before.	12.189083268282195
Possible, especially there, it was as she lived there.	23.496872627098426
So, Spain.	18.02748458367314
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he.	14.911790143350498
— Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?	15.226857223147912
Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue.	13.531221980457543
Her (the lady ’ s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin ’ s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.	15.39696047105812
— Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated.	12.67367602211849
Taken a few years since.	18.522338565154087
In or about ninety six.	12.364053984663679
Very like her then.	20.378655067426447
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen.	12.419165835372016
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup.	17.659344188142008
She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the.	13.241291556431976
He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum.	14.826753670820336
Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest.	19.75187780543196
Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint Joseph ’ s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop.	9.652025748458037
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn ’ t art in a word.	16.257426916390553
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar ’ s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to.	14.74255893871971
But it was scarcely professional etiquette so.	13.507001384490788
Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.	13.884082433163234
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.	12.716868230156763
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other ’ s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_.	8.993866548593061
In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out.	12.064668808792963
Suppose she was gone when he?	28.50813099654554
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.	11.702571351209706
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn ’ t think he had it in him yet you would.	13.883526587725282
Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter.	19.31511382870057
And why not?	20.362451369718755
How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate.	9.321109501445695
But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course.	13.285931391232394
He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin ’ s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader ’ s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader ’ s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O ’ Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune ’ s private morals.	13.455793076126984
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive.	9.891001408879056
As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap ’ s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character.	13.691712037790229
His hat (Parnell ’ s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what ’ s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother ’ s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.	15.174968244915613
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another ’ s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others.	12.020749312419827
He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn ’ t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.	11.243516239443414
It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime.	10.168064781293971
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies ’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ’ ways and flowers and chocs.	10.88801967297536
To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age.	12.381005522014103
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other ’ s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.	9.847773858881926
— At what o ’ clock did you dine?	12.097681110570226
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.	11.752407895533947
— Some time yesterday, Stephen said.	10.362565450005272
— Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday.	11.9824937741925
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.	11.667531569007984
Though they didn ’ t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought.	11.06902566573018
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.	8.309647757013877
For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people ’ s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn ’ t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan ’ s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	10.52219232514399
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night.	16.635715276980832
On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives.	17.771368514746975
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.	20.702887702642727
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway.	13.318045200666026
For one thing he mightn ’ t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn ’ t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.	15.025101515012874
At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps ’ s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.	11.842229299172978
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn ’ t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger ’ s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character ’ s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids ’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody ’ s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks _passim_.	9.996250466264133
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.	12.6528773290006
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep.	15.05364292102954
The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles.	9.610175125079625
Your god was a jew.	19.108020445243667
Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick - on - Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.	10.459764816295229
— I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it ’ s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over.	9.735853360218265
My diggings are quite close in the vicinity.	16.476529186921365
You can ’ t drink that stuff.	14.987323303027539
Do you like cocoa?	21.417888425019108
Wait.	16.144754643793675
I ’ ll just pay this lot.	9.972554548273985
The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn ’ t seem to.	12.797032811587478
— Yes, that ’ s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.	13.535214152694472
An opening was all was wanted.	17.435540663631997
Because he more than suspected he had his father ’ s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.	16.940042138191256
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers ’ association dinner in London somewhere.	13.775592441903063
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary ’ s lodge or words to that effect.	12.435789025559009
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.	9.353389786120795
— Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.	11.972459008912171
— And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.	8.742838995239843
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.	13.400367210206065
— Are you bad in the eyes?	22.577519394066353
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried.	10.107435499726842
— Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.	14.484422552195234
Sand in the Red Sea done that.	19.087105362614853
One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking.	19.694271521184575
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite and _Red as a Rose is <URL> Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.	7.765127923969114
To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee <NUM> d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.	12.092806461768612
— Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.	12.761590992048964
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_.	11.010798384114677
Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.	13.551280600612843
— One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment.	22.699244501857507
Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés.	14.907064933238452
To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment ’ s hesitation, saying straight off: — To sweep the floor in the morning.	12.787055888766433
So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion ’ s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles.	16.702146537852386
The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.	12.512967116619771
— It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment.	21.392208311352217
The only thing is to walk then you ’ ll feel a different man.	16.307023464914018
Come.	22.160365043217414
It ’ s not far.	16.282639803204905
Lean on me.	20.41593332795832
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen ’ s right and led him on accordingly.	17.761597647139258
— Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.	15.288957321129034
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc.	10.997908264479975
where the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new.	11.43348899026065
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.	11.396217538050744
So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place.	15.464674720266398
Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go - off but the music of Mercadante ’ s _Huguenots_, Meyerbeer ’ s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart ’ s _Twelfth Mass_ he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat.	14.116585447053966
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be_.	10.366122454397257
He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini ’ s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers ’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather.	13.608472023615075
There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore.	15.631886216842235
On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_, a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn.	12.102321313131945
And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel ’ s air in _Martha, M ’ appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen ’ s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.	16.37913727742433
Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn ’ t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare ’ s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B.	10.049886902172155
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen ’ s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.	8.806436596510435
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.	9.580014410110335
He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.	15.259143686131319
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other ’ s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking: — Our lives are in peril tonight.	10.91875421421558
Beware of the steamroller.	36.51433450387403
They thereupon stopped.	13.591616614629105
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts.	14.680743180317819
He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world.	15.803347687085331
But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan ’ s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face.	15.267635609829679
But it was no animal ’ s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.	15.07569481935757
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees.	10.238055670479078
Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye.	10.487331684273727
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen ’ s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.	13.281729029756637
— What ’ s this I was saying?	19.973687377856642
Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.	11.12793458744372
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.	15.9088146689025
Still, supposing he had his father ’ s gift as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall ’ s Irish industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.	15.885417748025779
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from.	8.20106103162114
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit: Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten.	8.28342502711587
These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_.	9.079840766708436
Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did.	17.388732487151355
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B.	9.691068981289277
A.	12.889029081532971
(a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society ’ s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you.	11.292209904720306
Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.	14.845074959000657
Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time.	11.250484113785973
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.	10.758429537606416
Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin ’ s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_.	8.891117043594843
Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city ’ s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows.	14.728135179112082
And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone.	11.489966282686835
The horse was just then.	19.749799739450552
And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom ’ s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person ’ s character, no pun intended.	12.273672347716055
The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds.	9.717464647901334
Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired.	15.872065845524586
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.	12.137049325657323
Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.	17.197485235083853
Und alle Schiffe brücken.	9.218646408651985
The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by Father Maher_.	13.660468625305334
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies of man ’ s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn ’ t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.	12.217385848792256
What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?	14.230415624100571
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner ’ s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.	10.539705438826937
Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George ’ s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.	9.78495979335275
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?	9.586986820460124
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen ’ s collapse.	12.678608949355082
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?	6.574677233675485
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial.	5.937316960493065
Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence.	13.324246003068986
Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines.	4.974784051454475
Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.	6.030248640667437
Were their views on some points divergent?	12.371206595867069
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom ’ s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen ’ s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.	12.233217165148108
Bloom assented covertly to Stephen ’ s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year <NUM> in the reign of Leary to the year <NUM> or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt († <NUM> <URL>.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree.	9.407451240464956
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman ’ s hand.	7.873793710163755
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?	11.350577146467248
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.	9.536863859106612
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?	11.90929434251836
In <NUM> with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard ’ s corner and Leonard ’ s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.	8.952582043210759
In <NUM> with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross.	9.173821205196255
In <NUM> occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines.	7.520935903807541
In <NUM> frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon ’ s house in Roundtown.	11.191968732420206
Once in <NUM> and once in <NUM> with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom ’ s) house in Lombard street, west.	16.880111776028453
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?	9.094855739096932
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.	9.791280054508569
As in what ways?	13.249344678105604
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.	10.976358340617685
At the housesteps of the <NUM> th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number <NUM> Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.	15.658306696392698
Was it there?	25.941243240057325
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.	21.37012363102205
Why was he doubly irritated?	15.507714332462838
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.	16.385415672472792
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?	10.133504151919908
To enter or not to enter.	20.210213323383666
To knock or not to knock.	20.44624334825366
Bloom ’ s decision?	25.099876810528087
A stratagem.	20.463129549418564
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.	11.558240855747414
Did he fall?	18.38343704898184
By his body ’ s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of <NUM> Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number <NUM>, epact <NUM>, solar cycle <NUM>, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction <NUM>, Julian period <NUM>, MCMIV.	11.29232205307024
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?	8.833106246184544
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?	7.958345619627938
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of <NUM> CP, a man lighting a candle of <NUM> CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle.	14.031631421404096
Did the man reappear elsewhere?	16.964113279576864
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor.	9.44486446321197
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.	10.857863367968717
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.	22.87403567210535
Did Stephen obey his sign?	11.716508950946427
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man ’ s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom ’ s house.	11.239578400089698
What did Bloom do?	18.05309031525604
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M ’ Donald of <NUM> D ’ Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.	8.903700497318223
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?	10.696444251874489
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at <NUM> Usher ’ s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at <NUM> Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier <NUM>: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics ’ theatre of university College, <NUM> Stephen ’ s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father ’ s house in Cabra.	14.179772063459335
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?	21.54366204759735
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies ’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.	7.485634950573057
What did Bloom see on the range?	22.637830939594526
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.	9.906322899872404
What did Bloom do at the range?	19.47154426549991
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.	10.976633524576425
Yes.	14.82237916275066
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of <NUM> million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ <NUM> per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the <NUM> acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of <NUM> statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of <NUM> feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of <NUM> / <NUM> million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.	8.62174139946374
E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in <NUM>) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of <NUM> gallons per day per pauper supplied through a <NUM> inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of <NUM> gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.	11.20504102338982
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?	11.015416440647561
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator ’ s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding <NUM> fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of <NUM> to <NUM> over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting <NUM> % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine % marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.	6.3066463439181035
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?	13.67627781677252
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington ’ s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.	10.130593794197178
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom ’ s offer?	13.071430630404164
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.	8.741950866603087
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?	8.997184546090807
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.	9.432783887118314
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?	9.768914762757507
Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.	14.75268889458422
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?	21.15351030823895
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.	10.750188327831449
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?	15.308585846239877
The phenomenon of ebullition.	12.05418927138571
Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether.	6.754146507920578
Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of <NUM> thermal units needed to raise <NUM> pound of water from <NUM> ° to <NUM> ° Fahrenheit.	11.1783463335137
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?	10.67776506708367
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.	8.948531458917863
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?	9.173612184790583
To shave himself.	17.469824105895594
What advantages attended shaving by night?	11.66171689405943
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman ’ s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.	8.44099437115272
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?	11.571763980809338
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.	15.792890169910232
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?	14.313685472439206
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.	9.327204600517568
What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?	12.572918048196744
On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits.	7.9322263695705555
On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences.	6.892742872682106
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?	21.514588307416112
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered <NUM>, <NUM>.	8.190863501127321
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?	10.827237951300276
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_, late pink edition, in the cabman ’ s shelter, at Butt bridge.	12.689099993471547
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?	10.827069170443751
In Bernard Kiernan ’ s licensed premises <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> little Britain street: in David Byrne ’ s licensed premises, <NUM> Duke street: in O ’ Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon ’ s when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F.	11.58682058901402
W.	26.96142366609788
Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M.	12.099014940330811
(Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the _Freeman ’ s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, <NUM> Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.	12.066058514673205
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?	8.010027424367474
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.	6.84879606574106
His mood?	24.514327859051885
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.	19.788258743275755
What satisfied him?	17.92353549194024
To have sustained no positive loss.	10.015456122704892
Light to the gentiles.	35.21164234850514
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?	14.725424468094129
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps ’ s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.	11.71703565120866
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?	10.610167008465242
Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).	13.995113595469242
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?	11.63298202071874
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps ’ s massproduct, the creature cocoa.	13.294039598008903
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?	9.255231291101525
The reparation of a fissure of the length of <NUM> / <NUM> inches in the right side of his guest ’ s jacket.	24.20505702217057
A gift to his guest of one of the four lady ’ s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.	19.717187202345546
Who drank more quickly?	16.52494319333361
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent ’ s one, six to two, nine to three.	13.749749424231755
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?	8.33649007936451
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.	8.98393478599864
Had he found their solution?	14.775225471129472
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points.	12.770468445811943
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of <NUM> in <NUM> on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of <NUM> / -, <NUM> / - and <NUM> respectively for competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?	15.978164051455959
An ambition to squint At my verses in print Makes me hope that for these you ’ ll find room.	9.44107318431004
If you so condescend Then please place at the end The name of yours truly, L.	11.794162139300942
Bloom.	18.279381378412623
Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?	9.955785673731025
Name, age, race, creed.	13.398352799769446
What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?	22.28835959943101

P.	13.98068437666092
What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the <NUM> February <NUM>?	12.52342598561186
Poets oft have sung in rhyme Of music sweet their praise divine.	6.431571080742284
Let them hymn it nine times nine.	8.834548897158863
Dearer far than song or wine.	11.928007694142229
You are mine.	15.309336367380011
The world is mine.	16.57667025099302
What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R.	7.242495494389185
G.	31.151366468604955
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (<NUM> January <NUM>) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.	11.906565980928939
Shelton <NUM> December <NUM>, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A.	8.57765660810599
Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal girl?	6.272382303595996
Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born <NUM>, acceded <NUM>) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist ’ s non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist ’ s revelations of white articles of non - intellectual, non - political, non - topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from _Everybody ’ s Book of Jokes_ (<NUM> pages and a laugh in every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.	8.778684226157425
What relation existed between their ages?	12.696749587833553
<NUM> years before in <NUM> when Bloom was of Stephen ’ s present age Stephen was <NUM>.	17.74444395190118
<NUM> years after in <NUM> when Stephen would be of Bloom ’ s present age Bloom would be <NUM>.	16.570600379956478
The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.	13.33335774706753
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?	7.094816482044903
The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon ’ s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s mother, Stephen being then of the age of <NUM> and reluctant to give his hand in salutation.	16.32869745947291
The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin ’ s hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of <NUM>, in the company of Stephen ’ s father and Stephen ’ s granduncle, Stephen being then <NUM> years older.	19.14457353664282
Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?	13.068837182928341
Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.	12.262172745513897
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?	11.396920693410934
Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen ’ s parents from <NUM> September <NUM> to <NUM> December <NUM> and had also resided during the years <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O ’ Dowd of <NUM> Prussia street where, during parts of the years <NUM> and <NUM>, she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of <NUM> Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.	13.897821950020695
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?	11.195998868416902
He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low ’ s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.	7.805337993402473
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?	15.185316320053564
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.	9.149674813676919
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?	11.5765036055314
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.	9.609033275728194
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?	9.597745190336953
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow ’ s _Physical Strength and How to Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.	8.01162505819955
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?	9.570030632168146
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.	11.597333338229904
Did either openly allude to their racial difference?	9.294483215732772
Neither.	43.669601723859934
What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom ’ s thoughts about Stephen ’ s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen ’ s thoughts about Bloom ’ s thoughts about Stephen?	13.65999012538236
He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.	20.77237305088926
What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?	11.743639974286264
Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty).	8.413248744666761
Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).	8.940910991507808
Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?	12.99450173084902
Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M.	15.14769624442956
A., alone, in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James O ’ Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C.	11.768803728091138
C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	17.785396720681796
Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone C.	11.244379097988112
C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	16.777302985077377
Did they find their educational careers similar?	9.507642384288564
Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame ’ s school and the high school.	16.132795118159702
Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university.	10.35086739105548
Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?	11.76278970466193
Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.	14.869512810660488
What two temperaments did they individually represent?	9.48706854697376
The scientific.	23.209347526945965
The artistic.	24.29018054683912
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?	8.821297749048817
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.	11.562132868191483
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?	8.039668334395339
Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults.	6.075321966929614
They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.	4.26109504468531
What also stimulated him in his cogitations?	18.227749450572873
The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A.	6.7218535134053905
James, the former by his <NUM> d bazaar at <NUM> George ’ s street, south, the latter at his <NUM> / <NUM> d shop and world ’ s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at <NUM> Henry street, admission <NUM> d, children <NUM> d: and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.	11.414393569299309

It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (<URL>. _My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon ’ s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, <NUM> June (S.	6.370161884925197

Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?	13.412636486557076

Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.	9.093486498917516
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.	14.362831467952443
Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball.	14.773117956164791
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played He drove it o ’ er the jew ’ s garden wall.	9.423047697091734

One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined.	29.273058517025035
Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny.	7.6852699825672515
It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting.	11.786711317163741
It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.	15.980101639005785
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?	11.319679656480533
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.	19.45779162780858
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?	11.436321770067227
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.	19.161337720014142
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?	11.611298980413775
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.	10.65262473313308
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?	11.067028977812104
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds.	8.99047378678637
From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.	11.015268711366083
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?	11.692307092146402
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of <NUM> and <NUM> years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.	13.124698210425471

What endemic characteristics were present?	10.925090542101229
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.	8.76292996074245
What memories had he of her adolescence?	19.089865270515443
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess.	9.859556254525646

On the vigil of the <NUM> th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).	10.023710396813188
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?	9.076336529629675
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.	20.875550682723627
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly, if differently?	11.322988644318535
A temporary departure of his cat.	19.788023042316134
Why similarly, why differently?	14.371956858166778
Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.	19.30445678167206
In other respects were their differences similar?	10.682005966116703
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.	15.569489279535633
As?	31.257434016479102
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat).	9.803401503334312
Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen ’ s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat).	8.458427166199122
Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat).	9.641071335335468
Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.	15.50738320947868
In what way had he utilised gifts (<NUM>) an owl, <NUM>) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?	12.42080584786412
As object lessons to explain: <NUM>) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: <NUM>) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, <NUM> / <NUM> minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.	9.750877087890885
In what manners did she reciprocate?	11.545495562511176
She remembered: on the <NUM> th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.	10.452774365438826
She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires.	10.211626515058361
She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.	14.901266601352459
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?	12.705143390746798
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.	10.42997141499464
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation?	10.654981866057659
For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction.	9.591226073904805
For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.	5.783962210709137
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew ’ s daughter?	8.395792417997132
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.	16.156875070121245

and E.	12.529900807099368
Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, <NUM> Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, <NUM>, <NUM> and <NUM> Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit).	13.357140202680558
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?	7.5265039443676
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler ’ s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown ’ s) papa.	14.295648128630267
The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of <NUM> he (Bloom) had marked a florin (<NUM> / -) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J.	14.28226572670161
and T.	10.267736432776289
Davy, family grocers, <NUM> Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.	10.04145551155575
Was the clown Bloom ’ s son?	18.26243572277148
No. Had Bloom ’ s coin returned?	16.76671915668948
Never.	30.224471500447596
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?	8.794335030884868
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.	8.52534002990168
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?	7.131542833310284
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.	7.305205053627266
Why did he desist from speculation?	10.801394748264801
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.	15.22793739575154
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?	16.668928487320823
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?	10.549115456454707
Not verbally.	22.301096124603905
Substantially.	44.876532221709276
What comforted his misapprehension?	11.248268760820267
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.	20.60721776055921
In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?	13.730524647083033
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by BLOOM Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by STEPHEN With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?	5.599178825299945
What did each do at the door of egress?	15.003117676448547
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor.	16.842671199535065
Stephen put the hat on his head.	22.74655480288856
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?	15.375960945862216
For a cat.	19.881936511250338
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?	17.368833232432973
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.	6.996278667365352
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?	10.80316697753606
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft <NUM> ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) <NUM> lightyears (<NUM>, <NUM>, <NUM> miles) distant and in volume <NUM> times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which <NUM> of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in <NUM>: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	8.580383986388034
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?	6.979845436030338
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.	7.482155403513509
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?	11.100335742339052
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?	12.674898467114227
Of a different order of difficulty.	14.90560111569493
Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of <NUM> tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.	7.180112066495252
And the problem of possible redemption?	12.364347958006068
The minor was proved by the major.	16.2554112680167
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?	21.119872260519383
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the <NUM> th: their positions: the waggoner ’ s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S.	7.238956353524405
Lawrence (martyr, <NUM> August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (<NUM> st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (<NUM> nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.	10.226961295152785
His (Bloom ’ s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?	11.87016969741419
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman.	16.279728895883174
That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence.	10.339819406893843
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?	23.42880085295067
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.	12.575424702019
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?	7.208244289252419
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.	10.49316843410257
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?	15.227226549335132
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.	10.051609858885824
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom ’ s, who attracted Stephen ’ s, gaze?	13.133409700710748
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom ’ s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O ’ Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, <NUM> Aungier street.	9.314844975045082
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?	13.259038362042611
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.	7.186563725733406
Both then were silent?	14.203243095480936
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.	13.153945854814339
Were they indefinitely inactive?	10.469252968555805
At Stephen ’ s suggestion, at Bloom ’ s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom ’ s, then Stephen ’ s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.	13.072025617320985
Similarly?	44.75790071189311
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom ’ s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School (<NUM>) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, <NUM> scholars: Stephen ’ s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.	11.500167451364154
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?	10.67687363989557
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.	6.773209605923271
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (<NUM> January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.	9.801995641785654
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?	11.208322238755253
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.	9.20446972589638
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?	9.753192522099003
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.	8.074642372703066
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?	22.509789872066957
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.	14.002772123583878
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?	10.803184394747037
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.	28.486989984438726
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?	11.96099586308641
By Stephen: Liliata rutilantium.	11.860637764672022
Turma circumdet.	17.534712543823726
Iubilantium te virginum.	11.41996657713615
By Bloom: Heigho, heigho, Heigho, heigho.	8.556920897775653
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?	16.464267730486675
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).	14.010997483885783
Alone, what did Bloom hear?	22.52048110041442
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew ’ s harp in the resonant lane.	17.435507128511702
Alone, what did Bloom feel?	22.59854916035979
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.	6.230045199181968
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?	6.552276542373097
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F.	7.637684966774321
Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).	8.558069471658554
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?	16.057457217655795
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk.	15.896821165881196
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?	16.439520549212777
Once, in <NUM>, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.	16.01273074986661
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?	10.959635215755247
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.	14.544708310311252
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door.	6.656033907343734
With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.	9.424772273791964
What suddenly arrested his ingress?	10.954421815751507
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.	10.836879168511803
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture.	18.326240129277906
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	10.84225630247348
Describe them.	23.692160040289103
One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.	9.027540669472486
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.	8.55249183407821
What significances attached to these two chairs?	10.996227102842653
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.	14.582794626811719
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?	13.78848216695202
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies ’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love ’ s Old Sweet Song_ (words by G.	8.203663122918355
Clifton Bingham, composed by J.	8.596662990577082
L.	21.061307083543863
Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications _ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_, close.	7.160122898449665
With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?	8.99620776108277
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan ’ s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.	7.344771639949232
His next proceeding?	16.255093260474005
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.	10.729326614584567
What followed this operation?	13.118897967317427
The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.	6.0855992148005145
What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?	15.170645210291474
What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?	10.053974728112706
In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl.	13.64288842971643
Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.	6.268206528468695
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?	11.789775809044636
The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.	9.199321107146192
Why solitary (ipsorelative)?	10.91145397212427
Brothers and sisters had he none.	14.526554877648046
Yet that man ’ s father was his grandfather ’ s son.	21.652061706008045
Why mutable (aliorelative)?	10.188740281889762
From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.	9.976425694534434
From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator.	8.026038183633407
What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?	15.980331565954865
The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite.	12.143022292409382

What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the inverted volumes?	13.051685894947761

What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?	9.925209182696504
Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?	9.841492398136634
Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.	7.9539064622051425
As?	31.257434016479102
The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.	9.651752219217652
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?	11.707843197256825
Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.	9.834494681387339
What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?	10.957490728174205
Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged <NUM>) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).	8.065374720693821
Leopold Bloom (aged <NUM>) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.	10.71823197795317
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?	7.886570721661122
In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.	12.72637487345704
What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?	11.966791307249887
Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.	12.4100619392889
Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate.	7.38972370751131
Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.	10.717295966979519
What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?	8.827327529180833
The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.	6.450728267766982
What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?	10.375033840769806
The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.	21.254023160736388
Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.	8.661079182377845
Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector.	10.565864212349341
Mendicancy: that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying <NUM> d in the £, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant, insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated bailiff ’ s man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded perforated umbrella.	6.187730872799225
Nadir of misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper.	7.787962171209035
With which attendant indignities?	12.123334877919225
The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing.	8.922978886095697
By what could such a situation be precluded?	14.013789049243147
By decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).	12.473270851891863
Which preferably?	24.483241011482228
The latter, by the line of least resistance.	16.99215646504902
What considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?	7.601958541901236
Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects.	6.152867539895826
The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated.	10.183880634535184
The necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.	5.590374351371223
What considerations rendered departure not irrational?	8.659146142775631
The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible.	8.749065379742298
The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad, as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures.	6.106892404878764

Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?	8.30686994220788
Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events.	9.322095503669189
Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall.	6.838395243851543
Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king.	9.510504893754197
What would render such return irrational?	10.05074498452184
An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible time.	6.958337239923736
What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?	6.3818819659673105
The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo, desired desire.	9.833311341771235
What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an unoccupied bed?	12.444178784259096

Bloom ’ s acts?	25.89457003390219
He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.	12.138841724539894
How?	26.78930661826885
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.	11.698840776449185
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?	11.316306027137149
New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.	13.134626278151705
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?	15.022191757170736
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.	13.14809976118101
What preceding series?	18.972504206333376
Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d ’ Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society ’ s Horse Show, Maggot O ’ Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E.	9.88266826107116
(Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to no last term.	14.541352898281671
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).	14.016916831903812
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?	8.674217610824195
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.	10.0252126105765
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?	7.7714681275874735
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.	9.37212914595623
Envy?	44.69076581821027
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.	7.756399251610187
Jealousy?	44.75790071189311
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction.	9.282277646865492
Because attraction between agent (s) and reagent (s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance.	8.78830667854883
Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.	13.662139823793565
Abnegation?	44.75790071189311
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September <NUM> in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, <NUM> Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.	5.577017948144983
Equanimity?	44.75790071189311
As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.	10.45339153198686
As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun.	17.660290210172708
As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king ’ s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder.	5.125053207173438
As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease.	6.224488982525478
As more than inevitable, irreparable.	13.559090618140832
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?	8.20693563278534

By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?	11.337339107094227
The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.	8.553151619572075

• Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out <NUM> d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water <NUM> woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters <NUM> per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come <NUM> or <NUM> times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out <NUM> kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ <NUM> for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die <NUM> times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered <NUM> teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea <NUM> days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give <NUM> points in <NUM> to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was <NUM> times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the <NUM> big poppies because mine was the <NUM> th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was <NUM> after <NUM> when I saw the <NUM> Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the <NUM> th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the <NUM> rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a <NUM> st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him <NUM> or <NUM> tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G <NUM> th Bn <NUM> nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the <NUM> acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the <NUM> th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <NUM> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <NUM> obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about <NUM> / - in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <NUM> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the <NUM> years more I have of life up to <NUM> no Im what am I at all Ill be <NUM> in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street <NUM> st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she <NUM> there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a — e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page <NUM> the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made <NUM> the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was <NUM> of the <NUM> wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into <NUM> of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that <NUM> the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no <NUM> with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the <NUM> nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about <NUM> minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W C I ’ ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their <NUM> Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have

affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the <NUM> things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the <NUM> of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after when I put on my gloves and hat at the window to show I was going out not a notion what I meant arent they thick never understand what you say even youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not even if you shake hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me either when I half frowned at him outside Westland row chapel where does their great intelligence come in Id like to know grey matter they have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the City Arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam only his letter and the card from Milly this morning see she wrote a letter to

courts that jilted her after out of the ladies letterwriter when I told her to say a few simple words he could twist how he liked not acting with precipat precipitancy with equal candour the greatest

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near <NUM> or a <NUM> her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because <NUM> drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing <NUM> times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in <NUM> years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly <NUM> years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about <NUM> perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure <NUM> carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that

great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were <NUM> of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at <NUM> in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those <NUM> lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for <NUM> forgetting anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave <NUM> / - each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats <NUM> consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news <NUM> years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <NUM> shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in <NUM> halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what <NUM> or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at <NUM> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her <NUM> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us <NUM> days every <NUM> or <NUM> weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced <NUM> times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about <NUM> weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself <NUM> and <NUM> times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about <NUM> minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very <NUM> st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after <NUM> years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our <NUM> sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait <NUM> quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their <NUM> pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and <NUM> children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying <NUM> / - in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats <NUM> years ago now yes hed be <NUM> though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the <NUM> th card after that the <NUM> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the <NUM> queens and the <NUM> of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and <NUM> red <NUM> s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait <NUM> I was married <NUM> Milly is <NUM> yesterday <NUM> what age was he then at Dillons <NUM> or <NUM> about <NUM> I suppose hes <NUM> or more Im not too old for him if hes <NUM> or <NUM> I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in <NUM> a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from <NUM> years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the <NUM> st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our <NUM> photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a <NUM> nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent <NUM> atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same <NUM> lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced <NUM> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <NUM> s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our <NUM> st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <NUM> of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for <NUM> he can make it for <NUM> Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only <NUM> or <NUM> Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the <NUM> st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him <NUM> or <NUM> times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue <NUM> miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ <NUM> or perhaps <NUM> / - Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent <NUM> or <NUM> questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at <NUM> <NUM> d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar <NUM> d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes <NUM> years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas <NUM> glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.	12.52591115623761
