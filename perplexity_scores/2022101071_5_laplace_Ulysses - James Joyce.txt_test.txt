21430.839441313205
A little trouble about those white corpuscles.	15581.962639481237
— Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.	12304.708482478187
— How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?	15207.249383849254
You saved men from drowning.	16703.943443575376
The scrotumtightening sea.	9475.141713356368
There is something sinister in you....	14772.176457652846
God knows what poxy bowsy left them off.	22833.968836487667
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.	22010.38647621629
Buck Mulligan answered.	6224.136356147297
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom.	26008.4906489254
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it ’ s injected the wrong way.	26698.187620840865
Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down.	34558.91991268358
A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl.	23680.371962169716
A servant too.	10635.285483357728
Janey Mack, I ’ m choked! He howled, without looking up from the fire: — Kinch! — It ’ s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.	31628.949259176792
he said.	2082.9626069148076
— The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.	18414.787461696593
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman ’ s unclean loins, of man ’ s flesh made not in God ’ s likeness, the serpent ’ s prey.	28980.61285813417
— Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I ’ m ashamed I don ’ t speak the language myself.	21795.78996617422
What did you say that for?	12058.273300138766
His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.	22794.05630808228
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.	18579.77196596897
Brief exposure.	37357.29393751545
He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.	28063.99493991725
— Seymour ’ s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock.	22961.43110013169
— Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.	17670.541249256985
— The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.	8508.58058646413
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.	21627.51895089872
— Go on then, Talbot.	9054.48165378836
My father gave me seeds to sow.	19212.189755267078
Ask me, sir.	14387.557165850567
— Again, sir.	10365.085915898644
Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir.	20674.80351626867
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail.	25087.96344739803
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.	25406.61911399585
Mr Deasy is calling you.	12092.941133809092
— What is it now?	3119.3289364108973
It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table.	25708.47200330719
Money is power.	25475.965226563
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman ’ s mouth?	17172.219581015364
— I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.	16419.739487595245
He saw their speeds, backing king ’ s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.	22139.43803012259
He came to the table, pinning together his sheets.	16391.351417192924
Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel.	34558.91991268358
Serum and virus.	36454.2157820986
Now I ’ m going to try publicity.	15201.02219770117
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm.	24123.201066369096
I am, a stride at a time.	11625.867489623743
They clasped and sundered, did the coupler ’ s will.	21650.346116911256
Yes, I must.	6244.023465942586
Lump of love.	36454.2157820986
It lowers.	9715.982011259934
Whusky! — Uncle Richie, really...	34558.91991268358
We have nothing in the house but backache pills.	18415.446546317155
_All ’ erta! _ He drones bars of Ferrando ’ s _aria di sortita_.	34020.467610900734
Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint.	32448.616624695915
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man ’ s ashes.	33581.10487429043
_Fermé_.	38912.41266155108
The sun is there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.	19559.36991877399
She serves me at his beck.	17692.132395855653
Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes.	24659.893359435933
Loveless, landless, wifeless.	35448.82746577974
He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.	18579.77196596897
Before him the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand.	27481.28671125064
Something he buried there, his grandmother.	24636.73621194528
After he woke me last night same dream or was it?	24600.7193824736
Open hallway.	22213.955770956934
In. Come.	10550.228214213184
Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.	32388.495516541287
Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun ’ s flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands.	30125.0699711049
He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	21608.52045015928
Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.	24937.507494140187
Welcome as the flowers in May.	35140.366405383036
My ashplant will float away.	19248.716685374224
I shall wait.	9963.234325218242
Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh.	25500.65490868726
And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist.	16631.546548443766
The coals were reddening.	11668.838309424802
— Mkgnao! — O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.	19693.928987351122
— Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.	15256.713517825052
She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.	20980.40670415039
No. On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door.	22745.514011403844
He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	23844.19208559525
Not there.	12347.466913126227
Makes you feel young.	26605.863231962376
Getting on to sundown.	26605.863231962376
A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.	22208.889971692915
On the wholesale orders perhaps.	11563.128794962495
The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.	22889.367637594536
For you, please?	17284.37897844419
She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right.	20314.11083596561
Still an idea behind it.	19900.66683093088
Wonder if I ’ ll meet him today.	19706.448764329256
Yes, yes.	3894.9689588121832
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.	33708.488666227735
Here.	2362.0757772639918
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.	20485.257559274065
Only five she was then.	22384.179986711384
O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.	14808.399196436496
The night Milly brought it into the parlour.	15406.691273895716
Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream.	31647.638222574493
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow.	23181.59408603685
C.	1161.2080535937555
— Here, she said.	4535.109004162769
Who ’ s he when he ’ s at home?	15409.058336254597
He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes.	14439.53023406585
Illustration.	38912.41266155108
An example?	11759.605667964739
— Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it.	16059.872709221876
He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.	18271.759436029264
Byby.	30885.11384226274
Of course it might.	10243.597338028665
Vain: very.	29263.668217739516
On the _Erin ’ s King_ that day round the Kish.	18776.367535085414
Useless: can ’ t move.	28089.602287826045
Virginia creepers.	37357.29393751545
Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows.	29498.382318128257
Nobody.	10295.660825818126
Invent a story for some proverb.	35140.366405383036
<URL>.	4272.710711296956
Her head dancing.	15379.05819590614
I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing.	21538.924433917633
A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up.	21370.69747101881
Singing with his eyes shut.	29080.429195189074
In the dark.	5558.168127333112
No - one.	3226.65960798326
Eyes front.	22213.955770956934
Hair?	22757.03484400469
no trouble I hope?	31951.642180895742
I see you ’ re...	11821.785856570767
Having a wet.	25475.965226563
Off to the country: Broadstone probably.	25649.25345269673
— Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh.	8447.112872119907
Like to see her again in that.	17500.37611259786
Rachel, is it?	25931.54026911626
Every word is so deep, Leopold.	25834.36477874913
Ruins and tenements.	36454.2157820986
A yellow flower with flattened petals.	14921.244558924276
Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?	9063.503033059334
I feel so bad about.	8073.462223018194

First communicants.	17251.97002124945
Turn up with a veil and black bag.	27075.857436713166
Perfectly right that is.	31951.642180895742
Palestrina for example too.	35864.32489992771
Eunuch.	38912.41266155108
Look down at her ring to find an excuse.	25447.687189843527
Hide her blushes.	29263.668217739516
The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the witnessbox.	15966.60799875638

Where is this?	8828.352889392523
Aq. Dist.	36454.2157820986
Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.	29735.94369951013
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	2994.3021789389563
How much are they?	11777.310299460807
To look younger.	14862.801913238223
Regular hotbed of it lately.	30300.196795249034
College sports today I see.	35448.82746577974
Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself.	24420.439723324725
Nose whiteflattened against the pane.	35448.82746577974
He was alone.	4679.979421603675
Great card he was.	24867.93696805612
His name stinks all over Dublin.	15429.122901378998
Mr Power asked.	4385.877497552825
Gasworks.	38912.41266155108
Got off lightly with illnesses compared.	23501.911458669605
Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish.	25918.814735950004
— It ’ s as uncertain as a child ’ s bottom, he said.	10253.073861953984
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.	18344.7905617779
He ’ s dead nuts on that.	5268.1484024172
— No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly.	8600.748513676413
What causes that?	11602.769131399857
The carriage wheeling by Farrell ’ s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.	18575.303757474605
And _Madame_.	8368.124053639449
Or the Moira, was it?	14341.452508876659
— About the boatman?	9234.28831528636
Mr Power asked.	4385.877497552825
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	896.7288464238603
Martin Cunningham ’ s large eyes.	15677.942621383123
As if it wasn ’ t broken already.	20070.55098152084
Wear the heart out of a stone, that.	32448.527384775727
— God grant he doesn ’ t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.	14993.8932437858
Very encouraging.	18984.474054716124
Our Lady ’ s Hospice for the dying.	24626.102857677
— What ’ s wrong now?	3522.64171758944
— Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know.	13369.848184143526
— Why?	2205.3111787558055
Terrible! — First round Dunphy ’ s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	21527.97341441929
Elixir of life.	36454.2157820986
How she met her death.	18368.476110653894

Ned Lambert says he ’ ll try to get one of the girls into Todd ’ s.	25333.513698782786
One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.	26761.031807581177
The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad ’ s belly.	26648.733096618875
Mr Kernan said with reproof.	9772.19702448401
Secret eyes, secretsearching.	35864.32489992771
Eh?	4374.936102783538
— Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan?	10638.352394558307
— Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	8832.538621682006
Whores in Turkish graveyards.	31951.642180895742
All honeycombed the ground must be: oblong cells.	22133.657348932866

Callboy ’ s warning.	35864.32489992771
— L, Mr Bloom said.	5562.80410682032
And you might put down M ’ Coy ’ s name too.	17791.035968495842
He was on the _Freeman_ once.	9741.288377050929
We have time.	9126.754437412856
More interesting if they told you what they were.	23549.947117055868
Like the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us.	21035.37669485009
Faithful departed.	37357.29393751545
As you are now so once were we.	21510.628421287583
After dinner on a Sunday.	21085.6945736744
Flies come before he ’ s well dead.	32388.495516541287
Last time I was here was Mrs Sinico ’ s funeral.	25184.106475891003

Jolly Mat.	28385.834409642655
Parked in North Prince ’ s street His Majesty ’ s vermilion mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E.	33708.61103573341
Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman and National Press_ and the _Freeman ’ s Journal and National Press_.	24884.341536980715
Way out.	24983.083887186167

More Irish than the Irish.	23651.216360930783
Hynes asked.	26416.19520512452
This ad, you see.	15187.369428115027
Then here the name.	14223.549216831429
You know the usual.	9603.30932940742
Highclass licensed premises.	36454.2157820986
NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying: — Wait.	33918.06554258718
a voice asked from the castingbox.	24848.46119029306
Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with his finger to me.	24725.725021934762
How quickly he does that job.	19768.268536544514
Pop in a minute to phone.	35140.366405383036
He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.	25823.194669674296
Bladderbags.	38912.41266155108
Ned Lambert nodded.	12027.589028838962
— Well.	2570.8665081485947
_ — That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence... _ — O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan.	26031.092174775764
No, twenty...	10170.011018061079
J.	363.7765778926278
It was at the royal university dinner.	12568.328830618553
— I escort a suppliant, Mr O ’ Madden Burke said melodiously.	9506.887999628332
Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrian fieldmarshal now.	34230.99460841517
A sofa in a westend club.	14921.244558924276
Yes, yes.	3894.9689588121832
The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across Stephen ’ s and Mr O ’ Madden Burke ’ s loose ties.	21705.978225794883
That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose.	22830.266019274455

Ah, bloody nonsense.	11375.43538828481
How do you know?	7744.288490716579
Silence! Pause.	29263.668217739516
That Blavatsky woman started it.	16691.741430926246

In Mooney ’ s _en ville_ and in Mooney ’ s _sur <URL> He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.	27682.614285593547
He looked towards the saloon door.	10513.67261005774

O! But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.	23041.03954804373
Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice: — Fine goods in small parcels.	33424.753253559575
— Here ’ s fortune, Blazes said.	13388.712184466736
Clock whirred.	26416.19520512452
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door.	33966.098215742684
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.	24367.006666361784
I was only vamping, man.	9253.911249315548
His gouty paws plumped chords.	16868.37829019953
What?	694.4811020788688
Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords: — _When love absorbs my ardent soul_...	30689.86173176949

I ’ m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.	18007.164519017566
Look at this, says he.	9944.619824585117
Here, Terry, give us a pony.	19422.530850401166
And he started laughing.	7547.8990197027515
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam.	16174.11435824129
says I.	2679.387231412323
The tear is bloody near your eye.	16510.648633426452
— _...	4993.517422394024
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?	24162.753083218173
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn ’ t and he couldn ’ t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he ’ d just take a cigar.	27987.09103381973
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him: — Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw! Arrah, bloody end to the paw he ’ d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.	31025.896533053918
And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn ’ t near roast him, it ’ s a queer story, the old one, Bloom ’ s wife and Mrs O ’ Dowd that kept the hotel.	29884.350643542763
From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance.	27842.05039973002
Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents.	32786.76794578445
That monster audience simply rocked with delight.	19428.66113593004
A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.	29128.126587334933
Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what ’ s waiting for me down Limehouse way.	32868.52361061174
Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap ’ s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators.	33564.44284673252
— Well, that ’ s a point, says Bloom, for the wife ’ s admirers.	15538.641953590479
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee ’ s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act.	29638.811612926158
True as you ’ re there.	22159.60040183776

Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.	19985.197019800315

— Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf.	14548.479283067016
It was a knockout clean and clever.	9629.01432129618
I hear he ’ s running a concert tour now up in the north.	18968.30456442536
That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal ’ s chest.	25698.84183176173
J.	363.7765778926278
Look at his head.	11744.339402709036
— That what ’ s I mean, says the citizen.	7479.6199877776335
What?	694.4811020788688
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he ’ ll dissolve in tears on the bench.	29205.091823583716
And J.	8368.124053639449
And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world.	31178.132713341744
— Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage.	22820.40055321016
All wind and piss like a tanyard cat.	21263.501611986165
— Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse.	13611.828101639901
And another one: _Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga_.	21660.333824053938
Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.	29162.040557569137

Firebrands of Europe and they always were.	34902.30912120644
There ’ s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo.	12768.041397354264
Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.	27660.87111421599
— That covers my case, says Joe.	7704.589667010046
I was born here.	6795.021925867749
— And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.	17571.051863778488

Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.	31136.830865099437
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.	22916.137234190064
— Who made those allegations?	7490.823334958247

J., when he ’ s quite sure which country it is.	15874.233648878706

A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom ’ s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás - Dugulás (Meadow of Murmuring Waters).	29879.504544508683
Gob, the devil wouldn ’ t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen ’ s royal theatre: — Where is he till I murder him?	28837.13112230356

Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.	27214.941335987092
— Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.	15157.086727320031
— Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?	9412.838615647035
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning.	27192.42083486094
The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.	21794.822966555468
He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.	30437.452205700483
It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer ’ s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.	29556.85806065224
The colours were done something lovely.	15138.40106451722
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty ’ s skirt near the little pool by the rock.	27907.329567887424
A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle.	29925.158471030758
She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks.	25517.783455654626
Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it: — Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.	26074.299009957005
It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft.	29190.58023380672
The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him.	24357.185297747455
She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl ’ s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station.	29784.81306910238
Sister?	8498.96645492669
Cheap too.	26416.19520512452
And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice.	15681.505202610017
And I ’ ll write to you.	14247.690406476197
Molly often told me feel things a ton weight.	25793.089254009847
All are.	8335.995552338416
Took off her hat to show her hair.	32388.495516541287
Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she ’ s on for it: good evening.	30936.3566468809
Press the button and the bird will squeak.	32388.495516541287
Wish she hadn ’ t called me sir.	28575.282930090332
Cause of half the trouble.	35448.82746577974
Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly.	32541.101447609235
Fifteen she told me.	23102.37600629954
Lord mayor had his eye on her too.	26308.747076048407
Why that highclass whore in Jammet ’ s wore her veil only to her nose.	26095.930378189732
Neat way she carries parcels too.	32223.979928790533
A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles.	20607.904081456734
Keeps them out of harm ’ s way.	25262.668283406798
Bad policy however to fault the husband.	26248.240215796708
Sometimes children turn out well enough.	29549.743357690782
Big he and little she.	23856.83802419791
Tip.	12971.327416137423
For instance if you go into a cellar where it ’ s dark.	22202.60540326986
Vamp of her stockings.	35864.32489992771
Wonder where it is really.	19245.81007792449
Animals go by that.	35864.32489992771
Ask yourself who is he now.	28089.602287826045
And that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh.	18458.855477609468
Healthy perhaps absorb all the.	32106.980663757928
Old Betty ’ s joints are on the rack.	24952.835158464266
And distant hills seem coming nigh.	16631.546548443766
Bailey light.	37357.29393751545
No. Wait.	6381.640687332559
All quiet on Howth now.	17600.276068666404
O wait.	10270.002221947569
And the old major, partial to his drop of spirits.	15405.86486101573
Bat probably.	31413.85213889263
Their frugal meal.	18860.070016166002
Wants to stamp his trademark on everything.	24519.35457103169
Say you never see them with three colours.	26149.81285771803
Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light.	27869.74400031129
That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling.	23952.181631533535
And says she and says he.	12825.015016106347
Calomel purge I got her for that.	34902.30912120644

Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines.	27328.264554905654
Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know.	27571.39541515292
Hopeless.	30885.11384226274
Ugly: no woman thinks she is.	32315.27403852894
Might be money.	12443.382325529188
Must come back.	13906.76747126521
What?	694.4811020788688
The stick fell in silted sand, stuck.	17697.48031034348
Just for a few Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	20290.861512826636
But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.	27990.834343193324
Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously?	29968.753871564888
No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away.	22717.204167412685
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird - in - the - Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her.	29340.70442510184
To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul ’ s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip.	31361.67397420503
From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.	30873.941124811186
He ’ ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that ’ s Irish, says he.	18141.202861971837
Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on.	27766.11328726045
_Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.	32636.845076480236
