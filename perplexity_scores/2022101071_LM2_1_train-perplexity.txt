It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.	680.2245070359943
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.	562.3110854850389
"My dear Mr. Bennet,"said his lady to him one day,"have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.	336.3273322093905
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?"cried his wife impatiently.	220.61455281733447
"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."This was invitation enough.	360.00520596706633
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs.	1589.5934686619457
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.""What is his name?""Bingley.""Is he married or single?""Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.	453.311300537926
how can it affect them?""My dear Mr. Bennet,"replied his wife,"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.""Is that his design in settling here?""Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.""I see no occasion for that.	447.96522629599644
You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.""My dear, you flatter me.	601.271372603248
I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.	591.2774863361913
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.	164.6573436366049
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers.	995.1400423898071
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.""You are over scrupulous surely.	717.3767669742656
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia.	390.0955223744125
But you are always giving _her_ the preference.""They have none of them much to recommend them,"replied he;"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.""Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	457.061478632071
You take delight in vexing me.	586.288218520736
I have a high respect for your nerves.	372.8664891037687
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.""Ah! you do not know what I suffer.""But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.""It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them.""Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.	667.6058687607622
_Her_ mind was less difficult to develope.	896.8949493468542
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous.	335.29769512539224
The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.	478.23571331928207
He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it.	457.66260143651266
It was then disclosed in the following manner.	384.40502555429873
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.""We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,"said her mother resentfully,"since we are not to visit.""But you forget, mama,"said Elizabeth,"that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs.	749.1363167543094
Long has promised to introduce him.""I do not believe Mrs.	220.13981335523678
Long will do any such thing.	302.833225344595
She has two nieces of her own.	237.16253197008731
She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.""No more have I,"said Mr. Bennet;"and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."Mrs.	350.67030238547267
Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	710.3510550612372
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves.	1709.1424372973447
You tear them to pieces.""Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,"said her father;"she times them ill.""I do not cough for my own amusement,"replied Kitty fretfully.	488.98783693384473
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?""To - morrow fortnight.""Aye, so it is,"cried her mother,"and Mrs.	460.5935406338301
Long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.""Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.""Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?""I honour your circumspection.	620.4225822337175
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little.	393.1066627659092
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.	301.7390028543104
But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs.	1192.1207969285867
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet said only,"Nonsense, nonsense!""What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"cried he.	626.3752179993436
I cannot quite agree with you _there_.	402.10171602303683
What say you, Mary?	1284.574956114089
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts."Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	858.1561645750393
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,"he continued,"let us return to Mr. Bingley.""I am sick of Mr. Bingley,"cried his wife.	418.41094134624495
If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him.	418.70147213276965
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.	357.8522168363528
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.	482.70389929557246
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last.	306.2546068554665
Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.""Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse,"said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	966.2669968136126
"What an excellent father you have, girls,"said she, when the door was shut.	1084.0265613347985
"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter.	314.2410311466423
At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing.	819.3485793083714
Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.""Oh!"said Lydia stoutly,"I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the youngest, I'm the tallest."The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.	706.1221810091726
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.	776.9483491802443
Her report was highly favourable.	488.8593381494349
Sir William had been delighted with him.	298.10292212221714
He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.	1354.930858123504
Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.	468.2219505446902
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"said Mrs.	498.7157014659758
Bennet to her husband,"and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.	462.89793629813073
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.	414.5874618004433
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.	1784.2676436199088
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs.	458.91832730519275
Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, & c.	599.0112702705719
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.	416.89158308874534
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	437.7433571931681
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.	736.6323139696069
Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentleman - like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	685.5825630559615
His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.	1021.3879001178016
His brother - in - law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	1044.6594781923
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.	792.5133474266573
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.	612.9577656059274
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.	313.1916468986681
What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.	349.6534483195445
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.	737.9960522503519
His character was decided.	316.61989724536204
He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.	756.5194276955061
Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters.	1600.884729385578
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.	684.7669008540228
"Come, Darcy,"said he,"I must have you dance.	877.7906597574646
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	463.2946539733154
You had much better dance.""I certainly shall not.	186.96661207730295
At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.	721.4503069109344
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.""I would not be so fastidious as you are,"cried Bingley,"for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.""_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,"said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.	542.2565867407291
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.""Which do you mean?"and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.	700.6043108178069
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."Mr. Bingley followed his advice.	450.1842690605575
Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	365.9783595740498
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	1004.3474484653062
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.	553.6290443371586
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.	391.71280466462355
Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.	250.19551426317665
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure.	224.28929861222252
They found Mr. Bennet still up.	258.2257001320587
With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.	332.83625855572205
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.	340.9897436015589
"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,"as she entered the room,"we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.	581.2188225133877
Every body said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.	461.22699683836777
Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time.	301.54022832742385
First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.	840.3171581219565
So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.	728.3159338274065
Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger - - - -""If he had had any compassion for _me_,"cried her husband impatiently,"he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners.	853.5697008305256
Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!""Oh! my dear,"continued Mrs.	494.7226112273562
He is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women.	417.5833304261179
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	502.78557506881305
I dare say the lace upon Mrs.	435.8464281359268
Hurst's gown - - - -"Here she was interrupted again.	130.40517634796012
Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery.	421.60533306539213
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.	826.8679662476346
"But I can assure you,"she added,"that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.	946.4547073593839
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	958.998007690839
I quite detest the man."When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.	542.6717944043922
"He is just what a young man ought to be,"said she,"sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! - - so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!""He is also handsome,"replied Elizabeth,"which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.	821.7716436805537
His character is thereby complete.""I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	405.2615025957045
_I_ did for you.	178.74742404346276
But that is one great difference between us.	351.1270487790263
Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.	1432.6951464164924
What could be more natural than his asking you again?	427.1798809478223
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.	373.7921861950156
No thanks to his gallantry for that.	236.44581611110416
Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.	656.9856935027514
You have liked many a stupider person.""Dear Lizzy!""Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	577.6596505498875
You never see a fault in any body.	306.0034157033766
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.	300.3283228503734
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.""I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think.""I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.	173.924543408987
With _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough; - - one meets it every where.	735.3405019963373
But to be candid without ostentation or design - - to take the good of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad - - belongs to you alone.	464.2813779960806
And so, you like this man's sisters too, do you?	985.2985764801746
Their manners are not equal to his.""Certainly not; at first.	139.17821500716303
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.	486.4200467460516
They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.	535.5540161192365
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. - - Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.	569.524615723359
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.	661.7446722685299
Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.	784.8090235952675
Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.	374.5764782181736
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character. - - Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.	1003.8771802976921
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.	605.2526937153995
Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever.	676.7467732185341
He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	2659.4773898839344
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.	1140.5847614646989
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.	884.048414575064
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.	939.0843222068551
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.	522.7062512285648
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.	429.0110775344259
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate.	587.7033944822581
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.	821.3050269104609
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.	604.683681947119
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.	965.4597448782274
For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body.	951.3598580155348
By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.	1098.301228735405
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs.	442.3643650816574
Bennet. - - They had several children.	201.7162454489228
The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty - seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend.	2011.6774476865205
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.	366.2838420702826
"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,"said Mrs.	841.5540155326704
Bennet with civil self - command to Miss Lucas.	352.29704847696127
To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her - - indeed I rather believe he _did_ - - I heard something about it - - but I hardly know what - - something about Mr. Robinson.""Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you?	338.4070878228679
Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?	885.7837539569183
and his answering immediately to the last question - - Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.""Upon my word! - - Well, that was very decided indeed - - that does seem as if - - - - but however, it may all come to nothing you know.""_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,"said Charlotte.	587.3342454886987
"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he? - - Poor Eliza! - - to be only just _tolerable_.""I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill - treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.	324.64861654414415
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.""Are you quite sure, Ma'am? - - is not there a little mistake?"said Jane. - -"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.""Aye - - because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; - - but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to.""Miss Bingley told me,"said Jane,"that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.	393.5290026236511
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs.	234.66813793904046
Long.	153.36327455690133
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself.	1364.782165695514
If I may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.""That is very true,"replied Elizabeth,"and I could easily forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.""Pride,"observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections,"is a very common failing I believe.	959.9177200387978
By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.	635.5626776446103
Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously.	1595.5603850116267
I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.""Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,"said Mrs.	714.0770648749725
Bennet;"and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly."The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.	368.60432076076603
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.	348.1738742196179
The visit was returned in due form.	408.151795100257
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs.	290.86520658352015
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.	742.1761014692511
It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.	532.8298416753391
"It may perhaps be pleasant,"replied Charlotte,"to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.	488.86220331771517
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.	374.9220199700907
We can all _begin_ freely - - a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.	549.7864913844616
In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels.	784.7466611249309
If _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too.""Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.""But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.""Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.	524.0724577831327
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.	712.9588406900352
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention.	345.528591639713
When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses.""Your plan is a good one,"replied Elizabeth,"where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.	635.2132711945044
But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	337.35998767624113
As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.	886.6944681145623
She has known him only a fortnight.	292.99165721506296
She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times.	514.0661283481105
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before - hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.	826.9058124198746
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.""You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.	434.3430461790848
You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.	472.6329412410179
Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.	375.13159752574444
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.	557.5510963446425
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.	491.0797012227377
Of this she was perfectly unaware; - - to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.	390.9481199853028
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	519.8896394935
His doing so drew her notice.	429.36493521426166
It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.	489.06142830442053
"What does Mr. Darcy mean,"said she to Charlotte,"by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?""That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.""But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about.	346.7585471014293
He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,"Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?""With great energy; - - but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic.""You are severe on us.""It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed,"said Miss Lucas.	742.7504373576259
"I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.""You are a very strange creature by way of a friend! - - always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body! - - If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers."On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added,"Very well; if it must be so, it must."And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy,"There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with - -'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'- - and I shall keep mine to swell my song."Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.	744.1881371771759
After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.	845.0971667199495
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.	1144.4782274086635
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.	706.1886214096589
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! - - There is nothing like dancing after all. - - I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies.""Certainly, Sir; - - and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. - - Every savage can dance."Sir William only smiled.	492.4798701404826
Do you often dance at St. James's?""Never, sir.""Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?""It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.""You have a house in town, I conclude?"Mr. Darcy bowed.	330.2374433182272
"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself - - for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas."He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? - - Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. - - You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you."And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. - - I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."Mr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain.	605.6841927559229
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour.""Mr. Darcy is all politeness,"said Elizabeth, smiling.	683.1512907929166
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,"I can guess the subject of your reverie.""I should imagine not.""You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner - - in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.	490.1240205907181
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self - importance of all these people! - - What would I give to hear your strictures on them!""Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.	606.9833522277362
My mind was more agreeably engaged.	552.4660424215606
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	459.0554819328182
How long has she been such a favourite? - - and pray when am I to wish you joy?""That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.	290.4626645028586
A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.	747.9438085264248
I knew you would be wishing me joy.""Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled.	624.416677428921
You will have a charming mother - in - law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you."He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	648.9366863122423
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.	762.3378785354582
She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.	562.0215036479451
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way.	672.5030904620039
The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt.	850.4796925309395
At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters.	904.7829193242329
Their visits to Mrs.	326.8153046917562
Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.	553.8662800640717
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers'names and connections.	266.58984743259833
Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.	733.01778606051
Mr. Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before.	417.6260753014418
They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.	689.9932802069964
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed,"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.	866.4885614320515
I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced."Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.	764.926975724695
"I am astonished, my dear,"said Mrs.	680.2938096963213
Bennet,"that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.	451.61550404625063
If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own however.""If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it.""Yes - - but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.""This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	441.2388580199789
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.""My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. - - When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.	519.7894678561992
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well - - and indeed so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals.""Mama,"cried Lydia,"my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."Mrs.	707.9192092067171
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.	518.8096956573352
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
what does he say?	296.05236942819624
Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.""It is from Miss Bingley,"said Jane, and then read it aloud.	1049.065154208761
"My dear Friend,"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tête - à - tête between two women can never end without a quarrel.	757.6184160708895
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this.	311.4305441382769
Yours ever,"CAROLINE BINGLEY.""With the officers!"cried Lydia.	757.1146876135116
"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_.""Dining out,"said Mrs.	394.8940160594067
They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?""They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.""But if you have got them to - day,"said Elizabeth,"my mother's purpose will be answered."She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.	558.6342831866082
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.	652.1461338163786
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.	567.3556198505116
Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.	527.8231030168785
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.	698.1081206487374
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"said Mrs.	296.4933448139318
Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	748.439150533594
Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.	653.061453820772
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better.	436.5282809376328
They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones - - therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me - - and excepting a sore - throat and head - ache there is not much the matter with me.	389.45913757525926
"Yours, & c.""Well, my dear,"said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud,"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.""Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying.	700.3607872946781
She will be taken good care of.	254.22547637431424
As long as she stays there, it is all very well.	638.2906758658165
I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage."Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse - woman, walking was her only alternative.	534.6427221211806
She declared her resolution.	275.2197496290954
I do not wish to avoid the walk.	184.99228548837488
The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.	738.157366124813
She was shewn into the breakfast - parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. - - That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.	775.6235527435996
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.	244.19406249100803
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	576.3433811852699
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	299.2394590244502
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	548.8958769405442
Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room.	791.4755661755635
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.	546.3815157982467
She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.	1125.7528969136017
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane.	605.2623492560781
The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.	1234.3033709748515
The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.	2344.406911926396
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.	686.1072345052226
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so.	659.8002019180734
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.	796.5309739115278
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	884.9535223126455
To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer.	576.5135354578481
Jane was by no means better.	228.90642507510108
The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	897.9533076828543
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.	515.8902743543891
His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.	652.2402710158925
She had very little notice from any but him.	243.137405050822
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	1017.0761739423918
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.	569.4908696874302
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.	1380.9968746724435
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
I shall never forget her appearance this morning.	336.28262312582746
I could hardly keep my countenance.	321.91672870858554
Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?	947.5459975909414
Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!""Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office.""Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,"said Bingley;"but this was all lost upon me.	971.9115457645921
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.""_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,"said Miss Bingley;"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition.""Certainly not.""To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it?	971.5376966068518
"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,"observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.""Not at all,"he replied;"they were brightened by the exercise."- - A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs.	746.6947012325761
Hurst began again.	324.6644524628674
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.	565.7935364603037
But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.""I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.""Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.""That is capital,"added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.	699.2492649701877
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,"cried Bingley,"it would not make them one jot less agreeable.""But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,"replied Darcy.	864.9959687663134
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.	1045.2481136479341
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining - parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.	741.0153696498953
Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.	205.0584977331537
"Do you prefer reading to cards?"said he;"that is rather singular.""Miss Eliza Bennet,"said Miss Bingley,"despises cards.	451.10384775937433
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into."Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.	363.98389103803726
Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.""I wish it may.""But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.	496.7985658577253
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.""With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.""I am talking of possibilities, Charles.""Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card - table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.	605.8492491225852
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?"said Miss Bingley;"will she be as tall as I am?""I think she will.	206.79573074056717
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller.""How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much.	540.8647549904572
Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano - forte is exquisite.""It is amazing to me,"said Bingley,"how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are.""All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?""Yes, all of them, I think.	827.5992864223484
They all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses.	6150.849434630602
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.	1320.9408470950852
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.	236.20698232208755
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.""Nor I, I am sure,"said Miss Bingley.	827.5377485119101
"Then,"observed Elizabeth,"you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.""Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.""Oh! certainly,"cried his faithful assistant,"no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with.	802.8985933379337
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.""All this she must possess,"added Darcy,"and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.""I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.	1178.436097359106
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.""Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?""_I_ never saw such a woman.	484.38631490672606
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united."Mrs.	2125.04129034626
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.	1009.1032764636034
As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.	809.4607130049545
"Eliza Bennet,"said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,"is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.	922.9295072523702
But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.""Undoubtedly,"replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.	1984.8195694079545
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.	662.7313569012452
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.	314.71380503448574
Bingley urged Mr. Jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.	838.1385292918717
This, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better.	459.1012473780148
They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	1025.623360288466
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters.	431.0525459665802
In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.	1252.2267741651926
The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.	1423.6904083764448
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	1333.8853224172808
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs.	990.1891894073594
Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.	738.0593899970461
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs.	265.7343021003817
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.	318.73434508334606
"She is a great deal too ill to be moved.	249.56932396947917
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.""Removed!"cried Bingley.	444.1290463931914
"It must not be thought of.	119.31798889097841
My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.""You may depend upon it, Madam,"said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,"that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us."Mrs.	968.1050480314547
"I am sure,"she added,"if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with.	873.3834735391056
You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.	923.8345472869837
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.	196.64390910134273
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease.""Whatever I do is done in a hurry,"replied he;"and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes.	540.4607803135332
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?"cried he, turning towards her.	663.4263745849258
"Oh! yes - - I understand you perfectly.""I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.""That is as it happens.	292.7115660904667
It must be an amusing study.""Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.	755.9553897000019
They have at least that advantage.""The country,"said Darcy,"can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.	422.0652047256676
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.""But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.""Yes, indeed,"cried Mrs.	711.7753938804834
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.	686.5592285674152
"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town."Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.	480.93368565429256
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.	1001.7725139169788
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places.	527.8950827385124
The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?""When I am in the country,"he replied,"I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same.	491.01044967649904
But that gentleman,"looking at Darcy,"seemed to think the country was nothing at all.""Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken,"said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother.	1047.0718340972835
"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.	265.8535999808377
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.""Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.	481.9877842357655
Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.	747.9585157725076
What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley - - is not he?	452.30385373596107
so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy! - - He has always something to say to every body. - - _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.""Did Charlotte dine with you?""No, she would go home.	452.58715019103016
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.	640.596303501757
For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.	930.1466758749181
But every body is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I assure you.	638.057314251347
It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain - - but then she is our particular friend.""She seems a very pleasant young woman,"said Bingley.	524.6453878986556
"Oh! dear, yes; - - but you must own she is very plain.	378.0786616030797
Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.	774.2399528596649
I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane - - one does not often see any body better looking.	573.2497135410453
It is what every body says.	323.4044225468402
I do not trust my own partiality.	279.53654948559335
Perhaps he thought her too young.	279.7781709699558
However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.""And so ended his affection,"said Elizabeth impatiently.	695.5237577631032
"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.	747.4893002472639
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!""I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,"said Darcy.	538.0229014404576
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.	2432.2599024854126
But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	791.0719511419994
She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.	400.0693921186404
Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.	536.6087851721658
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs.	655.9600864468447
Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.	653.1604398981958
Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.	985.2720260262954
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.	588.5957808341713
She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self - consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.	1037.1775656187167
She was very equal therefore to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.	417.8368010042456
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	586.7911276902566
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball.	669.7488534857017
And when you have given _your_ ball,"she added,"I shall insist on their giving one also.	616.4408056693652
Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations'behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.	732.7972272606158
The day passed much as the day before had done.	267.43202304011385
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing - room.	757.3595152902282
The loo table, however, did not appear.	2542.346647945436
Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.	346.43568466713305
Hurst was observing their game.	162.33951193758378
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.	879.3217611062302
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand - writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	1203.1403748743796
"You write uncommonly fast.""You are mistaken.	281.07748239674686
I write rather slowly.""How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!""It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.""Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.""I have already told her so once, by your desire.""I am afraid you do not like your pen.	471.0747555655307
I mend pens remarkably well.""Thank you - - but I always mend my own.""How can you contrive to write so even?"He was silent.	317.2596226301181
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's.""Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? - - At present I have not room to do them justice.""Oh! it is of no consequence.	455.1334305165795
But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?""They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine.""It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill.""That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,"cried her brother - -"because he does _not_ write with ease.	640.8904398681983
He studies too much for words of four syllables. - - Do not you, Darcy?""My style of writing is very different from yours.""Oh!"cried Miss Bingley,"Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.	726.6369790606948
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.""My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them - - by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.""Your humility, Mr. Bingley,"said Elizabeth,"must disarm reproof.""Nothing is more deceitful,"said Darcy,"than the appearance of humility.	713.6991036609226
It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.""And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?""The indirect boast; - - for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.	840.909440194536
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.	795.3317049268296
When you told Mrs.	215.9942503403769
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself - - and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?""Nay,"cried Bingley,"this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.	707.6659929011921
And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.	727.4608213945874
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies.""I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.	562.1949162822434
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say,'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,'you would probably do it, you would probably not go - - and, at another word, might stay a month.""You have only proved by this,"cried Elizabeth,"that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.	856.2716247263895
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.""Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?""Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for himself.""You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.	598.703266330524
Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.""To yield readily - - easily - - to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you.""To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.""You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.	707.4529805718713
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.	733.4764855251294
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley.	243.7321497679084
We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.	1725.99637250637
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?""Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?""By all means,"cried Bingley;"let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.	839.8239000560756
I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do."Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.	446.14674285555276
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.	540.0295504586162
Arguments are too much like disputes.	1210.2267387112704
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.""What you ask,"said Elizabeth,"is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter."Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	476.3836089808061
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music.	297.25325737406746
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange.	351.9411991767559
She could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.	725.1764375267564
The supposition did not pain her.	350.47875270311704
She liked him too little to care for his approbation.	409.5640552669011
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her - -"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"She smiled, but made no answer.	1384.8268990920496
He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.	639.4179684462924
"Oh!"said she,"I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.	287.6729034716415
You wanted me, I know, to say'Yes,'that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.	1058.0996180505208
He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.	586.1433901379443
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.	708.5743720621879
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	1451.838445329198
"I hope,"said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day,"you will give your mother - in - law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers. - - And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.""Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?""Oh! yes. - - Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.	797.4415096770704
Put them next to your great uncle the judge.	466.93463368670905
They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines.	542.4104000441122
Hurst and Elizabeth herself.	158.2609457211613
"I did not know that you intended to walk,"said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.	759.6249583115875
"You used us abominably ill,"answered Mrs.	918.8026733368929
Hurst,"in running away without telling us that you were coming out."Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself.	522.3428684616124
The path just admitted three.	805.8457279510741
Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said, - -"This walk is not wide enough for our party.	563.7545335300928
We had better go into the avenue."But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered,"No, no; stay where you are. - - You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage.	999.9952125581947
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.	1458.7060072837173
Good bye."She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.	735.6591617832505
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing - room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	636.5278241132647
Their powers of conversation were considerable.	192.09655394248117
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.	1225.1917539263416
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.	401.4283745980668
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was"very glad;"but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.	706.9287113918826
He was full of joy and attention.	236.71937211456034
She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.	542.6344724767189
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.	258.6206875235857
She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.	1074.155236342138
She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? - - I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.""If you mean Darcy,"cried her brother,"he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins - - but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards.""I should like balls infinitely better,"she replied,"if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.	783.1752493820966
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; - - but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.	1216.428728427893
In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to Elizabeth, said,"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. - - I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	799.3040707592713
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up.	292.8850616827253
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.	430.5543611150063
He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.	1283.2627574790708
"What could he mean?	265.7969770002775
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,"said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.	445.2392930158367
How shall we punish him for such a speech?""Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,"said Elizabeth.	607.3487293058653
"We can all plague and punish one another.	583.2728536318243
Teaze him - - laugh at him. - - Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.""But upon my honour I do _not_.	347.94916668467044
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_.	253.53457918587327
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no - - I feel he may defy us there.	596.2205450023263
And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.	1574.499675611068
Mr. Darcy may hug himself.""Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!"cried Elizabeth.	182.94909931911485
"That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.	378.8046898783648
I dearly love a laugh.""Miss Bingley,"said he,"has given me credit for more than can be.	497.0062783727704
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good.	444.92320252901084
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.""Such as vanity and pride.""Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.	542.7971731539167
But pride - - where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.	718.2017153189059
"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,"said Miss Bingley; - -"and pray what is the result?""I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.	402.55301843926344
I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.	1173.0338768888273
My temper I dare not vouch for. - - It is I believe too little yielding - - certainly too little for the convenience of the world.	382.22190196828666
I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.	901.5683176717818
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.	625.8205604791805
But you have chosen your fault well. - - I really cannot _laugh_ at it.	337.9426654301001
You are safe from me.""There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.""And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body.""And yours,"he replied with a smile,"is wilfully to misunderstand them.""Do let us have a little music,"- - cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. - -"Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst."Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano - forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it.	770.4605927946644
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.	410.7927382598201
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.	499.4399741866414
But Mrs.	108.18238850862897
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.	1213.8281745799482
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. - - Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved - - nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	840.3536119290991
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her - - that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.	318.7283403699841
To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence - - Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough.	269.508461470249
She attracted him more than he liked - - and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.	534.3886911149395
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.	795.2259276969967
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.	1990.4821592266535
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. - - Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	652.17392879973
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.	506.9429224767019
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. - - But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	674.8259417441866
The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.	883.8438554862907
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread - bare morality to listen to.	1359.0780627568809
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort.	249.82420982167358
Much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.	699.1121744412582
"I hope, my dear,"said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning,"that you have ordered a good dinner to - day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.""Who do you mean, my dear?	653.7047218702123
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her.	691.548960696336
Bennet's eyes sparkled. - -"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley I am sure.	272.72784933743463
Why Jane - - you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. - - But - - good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to - day.	424.93258577008544
Lydia, my love, ring the bell.	2565.876891173981
I must speak to Hill, this moment.""It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,"said her husband;"it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life."This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	389.2908726777088
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	1232.83778971068
"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention.	988.030613054891
It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.""Oh! my dear,"cried his wife,"I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	821.3088778036793
Pray do not talk of that odious man.	411.65815815247277
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it."Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	390.62314077385906
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.	467.08441769773987
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.""No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.	387.8891546226613
I hate such false friends.	376.3155042804018
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?""Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear."_Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, <NUM> th <URL> DEAR SIR, The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance. - -"There, Mrs.	1395.019571021797
Bennet."- - My mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England.	1262.3845297612584
As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.	855.3165345957519
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends, - - but of this hereafter.	646.7422909391132
I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well - wisher and friend, WILLIAM COLLINS.""At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace - making gentleman,"said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.	2059.873427708183
"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.""There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.""Though it is difficult,"said Jane,"to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit."Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.	676.2449153228074
There is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his letter, which promises well.	830.0717568108164
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed."To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.	825.6123396926704
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	518.0183516515127
As for their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill - will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters.	506.47568963517364
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.	389.73454082211555
He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	810.8694502199581
His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal.	747.9054907436771
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs.	392.5508205539485
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	801.7664217239347
Things are settled so oddly.""You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate.""Ah! sir, I do indeed.	627.0909075921686
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.	834.1057431882339
Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance in this world.	567.8304796775225
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.""I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, - - and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.	599.2259199675327
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them.	312.91738701791354
At present I will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted - - - -"He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other.	373.6469860993727
They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration.	135.29991470614306
The hall, the dining - room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs.	667.0430179253619
Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.	593.6849853496009
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing.	640.9545880751052
But here he was set right by Mrs.	308.34405831797346
Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	685.2380477305594
He begged pardon for having displeased her.	598.7478615119558
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.	429.6561241422844
During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.	888.1033530263395
Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better.	185.69649760978564
Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.	226.0746558716945
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank - - such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine.	611.809985941703
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.	663.7662947135453
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.	677.0292896119759
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.	834.365018970202
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself, - - some shelves in the closets up stairs.	678.4479702330885
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,"said Mrs.	615.0681982536145
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.	281.9170721797633
Does she live near you, sir?""The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence.""I think you said she was a widow, sir?	909.1726439398287
has she any family?""She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.""Ah!"cried Mrs.	523.0232295598535
And what sort of young lady is she?	328.0671620359345
is she handsome?""She is a most charming young lady indeed.	280.2514872306191
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth.	581.10977139088
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.	1107.416045099298
But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.""Has she been presented?	870.2322871092985
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court.""Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament.	994.0280271984462
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies.	577.2975923541028
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?""They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible."Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered.	765.6034649603948
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.	1119.019994494416
Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. - - Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. - - Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons.	1583.458908865281
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with,"Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.	2794.710515082782
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday.	398.46885438959896
I shall walk to Meryton to - morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town."Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.	874.0662193566037
It amazes me, I confess; - - for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.	899.237648636028
But I will no longer importune my young cousin."Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.	697.3583981631014
Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.	1014.1199586739452
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance.	731.9488416601853
The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self - conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.	984.4387518780832
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self - importance and humility.	830.115905635169
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	578.053290722783
This was his plan of amends - - of atonement - - for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.	632.208494777368
His plan did not vary on seeing them. - - Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice.	744.3278278823683
The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête - à - tête with Mrs.	776.1987153427815
Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage - house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. - -"As to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say - - she could not positively answer - - but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; - - her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention - - she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth - - and it was soon done - - done while Mrs.	611.7398184895711
Bennet was stirring the fire.	519.1221023725208
Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	935.0329626251063
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.	575.6997152730207
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.	665.8098970214328
Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.	787.5170992932951
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.	800.843278897264
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.	1504.6137276324782
The officer was the very Mr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed.	915.2742887672769
All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot.	1401.9945517745653
Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.	654.2785347482729
His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.	897.7184568830985
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation - - a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.	815.6100153089437
He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.	655.4278372480017
Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.	3737.0335975187822
Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat - - a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.	861.0251528333624
What could be the meaning of it? - - It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.	195.72438918726738
In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	945.5534463281024
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.	526.2871238092335
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him.	996.8960414854207
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the - - - - shire.	739.0847531556894
Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	746.0003248532236
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs.	282.56029068195727
Bennet by admiring Mrs.	413.55584723018166
Philips's manners and politeness.	288.5711859197422
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before.	733.8663939388065
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs.	362.71323228664454
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing - room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.	700.456824040684
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs.	763.9139595164683
Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing - rooms, and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.	764.899724814717
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.	852.3168023323703
Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.	721.4164645490114
To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle - piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.	914.6257773180228
It was over at last however.	238.77560879133088
The gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.	711.6340708722452
The officers of the - - - - shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman - like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad - faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	1265.9132542890989
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread - bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.	1179.3289758336373
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs.	555.6183906985985
Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	1967.6837861848658
When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.	995.2044228824819
"I know little of the game, at present,"said he,"but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life - - - -"Mrs.	427.2852162808102
Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	665.4481195184046
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.	459.0896188256456
At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular.	1251.2138703817732
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.	441.29785606718906
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved.	723.0627187859533
A clear ten thousand per annum.	2354.338396935435
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself - - for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."Elizabeth could not but look surprised.	358.3063295345703
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. - - Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?""As much as I ever wish to be,"cried Elizabeth warmly, - -"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.""I have no right to give _my_ opinion,"said Wickham,"as to his being agreeable or otherwise.	643.1574614510199
I am not qualified to form one.	275.08102905105784
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.	269.9755829604608
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish - - and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. - - Here you are in your own family.""Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.	476.3173404780975
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.	221.29948900461991
Every body is disgusted with his pride.	526.7740644747439
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen.""I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill - tempered man."Wickham only shook his head.	612.1134885294455
"I wonder,"said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.""I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield.	391.81298012856735
I hope your plans in favour of the - - - - shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.""Oh! no - - it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.	229.1701330960763
If _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.	1056.0446153299763
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.	1130.3189994154936
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,"he added,"which was my chief inducement to enter the - - - - shire.	579.895230802131
Society, I own, is necessary to me.	1302.3987596823085
I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.	585.0718061014823
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.	503.48135291113005
The church _ought_ to have been my profession - - I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.""Indeed!""Yes - - the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.	451.8658405292253
He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.""Good heavens!"cried Elizabeth;"but how could _that_ be? - - How could his will be disregarded? - - Why did not you seek legal redress?""There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.	585.1202850710091
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it - - or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	890.402894104866
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it.	625.2670608483963
I can recal nothing worse.	585.7869839172278
But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.""This is quite shocking! - - He deserves to be publicly disgraced.""Some time or other he _will_ be - - but it shall not be by _me_.	529.630800194592
Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.	761.986295252392
"But what,"said she, after a pause,"can have been his motive? - - what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?""A thorough, determined dislike of me - - a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.	813.9738932906375
Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life.	610.6413245007166
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood - - the sort of preference which was often given me.""I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this - - though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him - - I had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!"After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued,"I _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.	838.6266498433654
_My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips, appears to do so much credit to - - but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.	521.3972292126087
He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.	1122.2422231808155
"How abominable! - - I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! - - If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest, - - for dishonesty I must call it.""It _is_ wonderful,"- - replied Wickham, - -"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; - - and pride has often been his best friend.	496.04918862646605
It has often led him to be liberal and generous, - - to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.	1238.5615685000855
Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.	858.3998040490081
He has also _brotherly_ pride, which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.""What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"He shook his head. - -"I wish I could call her amiable.	540.9155193530484
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy.	282.13966224693127
But she is too much like her brother, - - very, very proud. - - As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.	626.4088393341996
But she is nothing to me now.	152.9288775578034
Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education."After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?	1243.638681565543
How can they suit each other? - - Do you know Mr. Bingley?""Not at all.""He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.	418.2401446198579
He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.""Probably not; - - but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses.	235.4171320280205
He does not want abilities.	149.77163870156437
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.	611.7924625380506
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	655.7621314818673
His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal - minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable, - - allowing something for fortune and figure."The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs.	1783.3987286366525
It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs.	250.47779174325368
Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.	842.8026926285106
"I know very well, madam,"said he,"that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things, - - and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	901.4357752607027
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters."Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.	703.8009626285749
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,"she replied,"has very lately given him a living.	788.3284790819347
I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.""You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.""No, indeed, I did not. - - I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections.	385.3431077483321
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.""Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley.	680.1104317975085
"Mr. Collins,"said she,"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.""I believe her to be both in a great degree,"replied Wickham;"I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.	691.0381824351263
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class."Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions.	570.7589945857792
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs.	252.03514742109667
Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body.	675.8841228057581
Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.	1115.5935745709523
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.	264.08346250232813
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs.	803.9542391311322
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself.	383.69200687232876
Jane listened with astonishment and concern; - - she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. - - The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained.	478.437554531028
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.	657.2305993223142
It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.""Very true, indeed; - - and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? - - Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.""Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.	819.2191481292111
My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner, - - one, whom his father had promised to provide for. - - It is impossible.	638.1129633398596
No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.	865.006365651397
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?	560.3207200958554
oh! no.""I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony. - - If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.	588.7942489855134
Besides, there was truth in his looks.""It is difficult indeed - - it is distressing. - - One does not know what to think.""I beg your pardon; - - one knows exactly what to think."But Jane could think with certainty on only one point, - - that Mr. Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.	529.958732621816
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.	584.6837308462916
To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs.	417.7936058647007
Bennet's civilities.	292.9201443795507
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family.	301.4488108538311
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card.	713.5346719386968
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball.	1354.635228739729
"While I can have my mornings to myself,"said she,"it is enough. - - I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	446.95455635721163
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body."Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.	828.1191964907102
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances: - - and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed.	440.9444702273528
Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.	372.21070496916406
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. - - It now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	591.0294778210341
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.	827.8568098175624
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.	582.2554388190124
Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.	654.1860960475544
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.	545.5965282525942
No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; - - the very shoe - roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.	1243.8921153945232
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.	1059.3310750545309
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing - room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.	505.6978107631127
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	510.34384994001306
She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.	592.5588739317483
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.	606.0583719217516
The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification.	743.5492387802748
The moment of her release from him was ecstacy.	430.85343167277813
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.	666.537172408428
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.	886.7863249219736
He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.	442.21105318557585
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.""Heaven forbid! - - _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! - - To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! - - Do not wish me such an evil."When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	457.3109144955684
Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours'looks their equal amazement in beholding it.	567.4096413155611
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance.	443.14177847845747
He replied, and was again silent.	566.4315058883877
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. - - _I_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.	525.5556443226712
"Very well. - - That reply will do for the present. - - Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. - - But _now_ we may be silent.""Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?""Sometimes.	380.3797164101284
One must speak a little, you know.	643.0119070562134
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.""Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?""Both,"replied Elizabeth archly;"for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. - - We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.""This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"said he.	802.1383162394687
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added,"When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."The effect was immediate.	1228.2903565830763
At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends - - whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain.""He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,"replied Elizabeth with emphasis,"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life."Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	731.2472884691092
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.	553.4209389781047
Such very superior dancing is not often seen.	496.46335632373535
It is evident that you belong to the first circles.	439.6579536341628
Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.""I do not think we were speaking at all.	933.7391781019234
"Books - - Oh! no. - - I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.""I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. - - We may compare our different opinions.""No - - I cannot talk of books in a ball - room; my head is always full of something else.""The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes - - does it?"said he, with a look of doubt.	420.1533855749431
"Yes, always,"she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming,"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.	1825.7707224227306
"I do not get on at all.	138.244727536235
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.	1100.3937293195297
Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner.	875.1670601943613
His coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.	745.8978830537777
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better.""His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,"said Elizabeth angrily;"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.""I beg your pardon,"replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.	773.2227561070068
"Excuse my interference. - - It was kindly meant.""Insolent girl!"said Elizabeth to herself. - -"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.	355.9636967831614
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. - - Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.	742.2187249518133
"I want to know,"said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's,"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.	412.42851615479844
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.""No,"replied Jane,"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you.	421.9007223224064
Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.	462.8512528003335
I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.""Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?""No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.""This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.	287.11012401679926
I am perfectly satisfied.	234.9426495156052
Mr. Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before."She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.	554.9989541765598
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.	629.499670069961
On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.	460.8987095267077
"I have found out,"said he,"by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness.	502.24683353015865
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.	437.4362940385043
How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with - - perhaps - - a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! - - I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.	439.40936325341795
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.""You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?""Indeed I am.	325.872840126765
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.	300.4178433638416
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. - - Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom - - provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained.	608.7472495293183
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.	545.8101111759026
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself."And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.	909.474340317001
Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words"apology,""Hunsford,"and"Lady Catherine de Bourgh."- - It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.	598.9643916034391
Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.	744.9464787489825
Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.	867.2084509991366
Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.	153.1336183568493
Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.	205.7869938842249
He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.	490.71860426396034
Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.	666.8510107705818
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.	438.597205646599
Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	709.4139379988112
When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley. - - It was an animating subject, and Mrs.	646.599731582481
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.	635.8840641565059
It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.	659.7029412003491
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.	414.3419529197724
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.	641.4221355090549
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them.	707.1670779679434
"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?	447.0416288784003
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear.""For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. - - What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy? - - You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing."Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.	533.9252739769173
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	459.93342417930785
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.	369.39227931879714
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	529.88251869686
At length however Mrs.	381.611305670414
Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	761.1230685210363
Elizabeth now began to revive.	383.64656262247223
But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company.	724.649746689333
By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, - - but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	743.436339373732
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.	644.9770021027482
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. - - Elizabeth was in agonies.	425.42201349433265
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.	464.2814663744917
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave.	1517.6756149857308
She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.	920.791256140974
He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,"That will do extremely well, child.	1369.394963237982
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. - - Others of the party were now applied to.	673.7814890302254
"If I,"said Mr. Collins,"were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. - - I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.	664.6755034851484
The rector of a parish has much to do. - - In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.	597.519864554765
He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.	674.9292761908275
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.	804.3574671169456
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.	472.5071527531095
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.	299.15708293181785
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	576.6113316009881
He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening.	385.86724720269626
There was no arguing upon such a project.	738.6977187508289
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good - naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.	719.1242749991576
She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.	717.4566090132882
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.	313.9291009768984
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs.	295.9840154522919
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	550.0024899605096
They repulsed every attempt of Mrs.	506.4259673631125
Darcy said nothing at all.	168.117171456156
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.	666.0527124384225
Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of"Lord, how tired I am!"accompanied by a violent yawn.	842.5628698412952
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs.	934.5779123959359
Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	556.658027698347
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.	305.36406939180733
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.	522.6221497397026
Mr. Collins made his declaration in form.	127.23040031999966
Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	614.5368287167536
On finding Mrs.	336.50715160997646
Bennet instantly answered,"Oh dear! - - Yes - - certainly. - - I am sure Lizzy will be very happy - - I am sure she can have no objection. - - Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs."And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,"Dear Ma'am, do not go. - - I beg you will not go. - - Mr. Collins must excuse me. - - He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	572.0037072019707
I am going away myself.""No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. - - I desire you will stay where you are."- - And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added,"Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins."Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction - - and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.	804.2319719646952
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.	413.29200301544876
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.	2261.7091721282445
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address.	469.34609850021684
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	864.4187226635916
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life.	423.4628192260837
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying - - and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did."The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish.	808.4674625869114
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly - - which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.	609.1173897280001
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford - - between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs.	827.9672186008139
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot - stool, that she said,'Mr. Collins, you must marry.	1316.3040630876235
This is my advice.	244.45491883358122
Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.'Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.	864.3727338455487
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.	491.001043443324
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women.	748.1578198710998
But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place - - which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.	1340.0141520119041
This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.	906.2003710463663
On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	905.7421302996481
"You are too hasty, Sir,"she cried.	584.790713822915
Let me do it without farther loss of time.	368.3861759212953
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.	594.5202146998207
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.""Upon my word, Sir,"cried Elizabeth,"your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration.	781.113058669416
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.	481.7139766909672
You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say.	492.7533308116647
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self - reproach.	927.6482415026579
This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled."And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.""Really, Mr. Collins,"cried Elizabeth with some warmth,"you puzzle me exceedingly.	718.6450683499409
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one.""You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.	545.8728004424452
My reasons for believing it are briefly these: - - It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable.	643.6089905783592
My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	814.7560724746294
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.	732.9316129249552
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.	344.46706300587454
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.	435.0136990408
My feelings in every respect forbid it.	469.8975183425234
Can I speak plainer?	989.4338458284926
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart.""You are uniformly charming!"cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry;"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable."To such perseverance in wilful self - deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.	857.0619636229933
Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs.	305.0926697154128
Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast - room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.	863.383554837943
This information, however, startled Mrs.	3700.231404841117
Bennet; - - she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.	508.47808470147544
"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,"she added,"that Lizzy shall be brought to reason.	661.9981361948394
I will speak to her about it myself directly.	217.97089978056627
She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it.""Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam,"cried Mr. Collins;"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	666.0788133263657
If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.""Sir, you quite misunderstand me,"said Mrs.	1234.2342097729663
Bennet, alarmed.	1086.4154974710373
"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.	371.21548165615826
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived.	427.73228907951847
I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library,"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	619.6805803706872
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,"said he, when she had finished her speech.	388.6621845490574
"Of what are you talking?""Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.	211.9340654513173
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.""And what am I to do on the occasion? - - It seems an hopeless business.""Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.	283.52609610712193
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.""Let her be called down.	208.0339942965045
She shall hear my opinion."Mrs.	197.83878849821545
Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.	693.592867051411
"I have sent for you on an affair of importance.	210.28605857611802
Is it true?"Elizabeth replied that it was.	201.31293698070047
"Very well - - and this offer of marriage you have refused?""I have, Sir.""Very well.	219.23346304181024
We now come to the point.	218.43854222087515
Your mother insists upon your accepting it.	995.8673610881964
Is not it so, Mrs.	498.7507962450307
Bennet?""Yes, or I will never see her again.""An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.	505.8363041923941
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. - - Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_."Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs.	316.98162178547443
Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.	963.023100980779
"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way?	748.0404757536834
You promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him.""My dear,"replied her husband,"I have two small favours to request.	650.0751733424441
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	761.2006607562171
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs.	509.09762735988886
She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.	518.1801740715341
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering; - - and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	961.1537330063264
Though her manner varied however, her determination never did.	1258.9078102492863
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.	1205.0195394099312
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.	499.955265768758
His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	327.9558363310119
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them.	519.6866582756231
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper,"I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! - - What do you think has happened this morning? - - Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast - room, where Mrs.	736.0468865972407
Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.	715.5087668844039
"Aye, there she comes,"continued Mrs.	607.2906395777395
I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. - - Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body.	313.9297049141868
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking.	788.5313295931845
Those who do not complain are never pitied."Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	793.0579582546404
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together."Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.	1043.4916206794828
In a doleful voice Mrs.	580.5776311633202
Bennet thus began the projected conversation. - -"Oh! Mr. Collins!"- -"My dear Madam,"replied he,"let us be for ever silent on this point.	461.2641554385675
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.	459.08029174647737
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.	582.0668106289683
You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	1354.1950285542068
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.	700.2983699824892
But we are all liable to error.	518.8477064482713
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.	379.37407531898583
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	812.4492997832956
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.	1748.9743092768567
He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.	765.5165973017163
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs.	569.3958892299624
Bennet's ill humour or ill health.	447.1626467103618
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.	587.3591520558712
He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.	449.0969936472542
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.	786.5369358899975
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over. - - To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.	767.5228054175119
His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.	389.45032796452386
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	1702.0554517535718
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.	667.9141202071936
When they had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal.	1190.1883585090884
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	506.1198616004789
You shall hear what she says."She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr. Hurst had a house.	747.5748740740673
The next was in these words.	281.70407468816677
"I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence.	803.9600288190568
"It is unlucky,"said she, after a short pause,"that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.	610.6284821577301
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? - - Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.""Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter.	612.089993569152
I will read it to you - -"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	782.3727463827473
It must be his own doing. - - He is his own master.	224.34135616379575
But you do not know _all_.	284.18834503553524
I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me.	803.2156495360848
I will have no reserves from _you_.""Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again.	517.729236494945
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister.	921.2818734213528
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.	553.5568670753024
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?""What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"- - said Jane as she finished it.	666.0312717397283
"Is it not clear enough? - - Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?	579.6508756389179
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?""Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. - - Will you hear it?""Most willingly.""You shall have it in few words.	404.84939148276743
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.	287.5494417978735
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."Jane shook her head.	358.0009847435347
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. - - No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection.	832.860611307234
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot.	231.93671284603803
She is not such a simpleton.	229.47983465272637
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.	461.14954136202607
But the case is this.	158.88904519216425
We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.	890.2860190175178
But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.""If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,"replied Jane,"your representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	809.7896228923706
But I know the foundation is unjust.	380.0761163824816
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself.""That is right. - - You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.	511.1986193663122
A thousand things may arise in six months!"The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.	477.8208214695695
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one.	1033.2537181163623
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	460.41682598568576
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	652.4681708794042
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.	696.3505982353103
After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.	603.9690033023928
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.	467.72224187017076
"It keeps him in good humour,"said she,"and I am more obliged to you than I can express."Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.	425.78082919694646
This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; - - its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself.	667.7559987945577
His reception however was of the most flattering kind.	422.53975288098263
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.	763.2302728573135
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	435.15110528513924
In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.	533.2785434924092
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.	856.1558168614355
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	437.04565976202144
Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.	525.0286594001233
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James's.	604.1494014587565
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion.	646.4362465737056
The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid.	959.3561030148004
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.	562.307783283777
She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.	331.7701287722299
Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.	353.9780114955707
But still he would be her husband. - - Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well - educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.	942.8026368477052
This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty - seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.	794.8356730745678
The least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person.	714.7012582141472
Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation.	457.72050241121104
She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	528.1917740901952
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs.	267.5762088359541
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.	588.7082984879228
"My dear Madam,"he replied,"this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir? - - You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness.""My dear sir,"replied Mr. Collins,"I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence.""You cannot be too much on your guard.	683.7889758574438
As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.	720.4013024462679
Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.	356.9925726034866
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion.	613.6014193396038
"I see what you are feeling,"replied Charlotte, - -"you must be surprised, very much surprised, - - so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.	582.1634717349363
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.	317.2303383389211
I am not romantic you know.	269.9607553865804
I never was.	78.20082511122399
I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."Elizabeth quietly answered"Undoubtedly;"- - and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.	636.908680299978
Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.	508.627065589097
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.	390.34213259160435
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.	774.99336669604
Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins, was a most humiliating picture! - - And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.	527.0472990919537
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.	768.5462791871278
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.	637.8515329729656
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.	826.6700515244211
Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.	715.0247294834942
Nothing could console and nothing appease her. - - Nor did that day wear out her resentment.	535.5714780493415
Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.	635.292155511039
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.	474.95533551163214
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs.	502.55189148962876
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs.	520.4589336785062
Bennet's sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.	641.9854379842553
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	538.8464746069341
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	889.300360254145
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.	692.4948038669003
After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.	933.0287349710209
Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs.	260.3790092465417
Bennet.	69.40071254368596
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs.	206.40749480346076
Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued absence.	405.8546162527566
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.	672.6849399768861
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.	850.3377463874868
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring.	732.8983770782937
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.	975.7187647729119
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.	510.2536528776538
He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love - making relieved them from a great deal of his company.	743.5528358950622
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	515.9969024016727
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.	373.18760869471384
As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence.	1030.9291527924913
Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead.	498.5202418101956
"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,"said she,"it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!""My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	645.1884806265772
Let us hope for better things.	462.1455798173567
Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before,"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.	1076.8401348646196
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it.""What should not you mind?""I should not mind any thing at all.""Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.""I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail.	317.071192405091
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! - - Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?""I leave it to yourself to determine,"said Mr. Bennet.	322.4373852130773
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.	616.9476540828981
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.	416.41510028072815
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.	809.5128635949713
Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.	1272.64209358233
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.	668.7586208947222
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.	777.8657800053787
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others.	730.2820351598547
To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit.	438.45719437305013
Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.	714.6654058082501
It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.	1247.9764530535863
She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends'interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.	937.6823828485007
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs.	298.9526641571446
Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying,"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.	741.1406204057215
But I will not repine.	235.09502141313433
It cannot last long.	301.47783089614995
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all.	427.7010476948699
I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.	405.24985444902967
Thank God! I have not _that_ pain.	248.13335735450403
A little time therefore. - - I shall certainly try to get the better."With a stronger voice she soon added,"I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself.""My dear Jane!"exclaimed Elizabeth,"you are too good.	525.4803349883435
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you.	462.008566762535
"Nay,"said Elizabeth,"this is not fair.	676.2722833530431
_You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body.	540.9414142757745
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will.	951.0589303331428
You need not.	187.61518776699955
There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.	781.9210490043025
The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.	423.0835392888073
I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage.	343.3294740378087
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.	474.08783790783536
Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's prudent, steady character.	1362.0386948640344
Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.""To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart.	553.8274624414196
You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.	659.3032526756592
You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness.""I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,"replied Jane,"and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together.	1265.148298307381
But enough of this.	137.01257502170287
You alluded to something else.	433.98695389950154
You mentioned _two_ instances.	1200.5367410812532
I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.	1572.2538840223385
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.	470.5431777031987
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.	593.1538819946425
Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.""And do you impute it to either of those?""Yes; to the last.	524.077160454669
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem.	569.6365916704984
Stop me whilst you can.""You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him.""Yes, in conjunction with his friend.""I cannot believe it.	685.3916268190754
Why should they try to influence him?	461.48915338954646
They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it.""Your first position is false.	680.949653451701
They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.""Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy,"replied Jane;"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.	723.4482499749095
They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.	373.43205664484265
But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's.	973.842937731062
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?	953.3334109538637
If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	662.0887692434225
By supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy.	1664.7513802091605
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken - - or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	571.907537069569
Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	380.5181617188937
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.	742.1647786109073
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.	543.2657936510814
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet's best comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.	364.69579950399753
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently.	122.35590700484899
"So, Lizzy,"said he one day,"your sister is crossed in love I find.	638.7244600737421
I congratulate her.	112.73349124945206
Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	411.42803692001314
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.	477.5651388101523
When is your turn to come?	340.51986011074075
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.	485.8366892251373
Now is your time.	232.35214780131756
Let Wickham be _your_ man.	368.8019205352875
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune.""True,"said Mr. Bennet,"but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it."Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family.	596.8685244174945
They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.	686.1845755417338
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter.	571.7144911945509
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes - - but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	784.0464765906108
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday.	520.4063228490893
The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.	937.7985299990145
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.	667.8965230436957
On the following Monday, Mrs.	943.76671257042
Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman - like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.	905.1308294782373
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable.	727.6318448219213
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.	909.3290338954465
Bennet and Mrs.	89.9927734911772
Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.	2113.6961525724846
Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.	1144.7902480077876
They had frequently been staying with her in town.	280.2775529990052
The first part of Mrs.	202.61854262924396
Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.	965.7318668850482
When this was done, she had a less active part to play.	659.6671721418589
It became her turn to listen.	308.872320916983
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.	626.9336708488472
They had all been very ill - used since she last saw her sister.	331.1873555554063
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.	227.59008958663824
"I do not blame Jane,"she continued,"for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley, if she could.	525.8103710648032
But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness.	426.4173163098575
He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.	294.47288432789264
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.	435.63339889884105
The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.	1504.7704618522807
I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.	272.5980567537037
However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."Mrs.	783.531628579287
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.	588.0759757046753
"I am sorry it went off.	227.0728289311388
But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.""An excellent consolation in its way,"said Elizabeth,"but it will not do for _us_.	1093.7761140994282
We do not suffer by _accident_.	582.0774195745056
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.""But that expression of'violently in love'is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	617.437373048863
He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.	1014.868959199689
Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	791.8824520153339
Could there be finer symptoms?	403.1930242326045
Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.	940.941279095543
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us?	327.01800468606547
Change of scene might be of service - - and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything."Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.	577.9913071436807
"I hope,"added Mrs.	348.4192317134776
Gardiner,"that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her.	476.9037566559713
We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.""And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it?	684.5461982904552
Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.""So much the better.	749.4471917218082
I hope they will not meet at all.	198.40141391177528
_She_ will not be able to help calling.""She will drop the acquaintance entirely."But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.	567.2729835076866
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re - animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions.	968.0776442162012
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.	617.5146558432696
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.	794.9290578175261
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner.	300.92808457280915
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs.	433.22773217734266
Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.	1476.0011656895038
Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.	668.8038463909755
To Mrs.	161.64101685063267
Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.	1098.2068723441587
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well.	521.3239761971553
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.	853.4842143418365
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.	1104.6645934145065
On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill - natured boy.	931.9866756024032
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.	845.4660409940324
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.	609.8023109560924
Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.	744.9318189762499
I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.	326.34711379755953
But as it is - - you must not let your fancy run away with you.	250.962516517815
Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure.	811.9312540326257
You must not disappoint your father.""My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.""Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.""Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.	649.316966990794
I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too.	314.67471404226836
He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.""Elizabeth, you are not serious now.""I beg your pardon.	353.9135636427615
I will try again.	204.47207667441816
At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.	319.3885182891173
But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw - - and if he becomes really attached to me - - I believe it will be better that he should not.	455.0735182451778
I see the imprudence of it. - - Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! - - My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.	305.5607761232739
My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham.	825.5575548834527
In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?	908.8631905210708
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.	223.57867144982598
At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him.""As I did the other day,"said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile;"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.	871.6163035164745
But do not imagine that he is always here so often.	295.1544432758212
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.	379.0933157810188
You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.	311.31903926744815
But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied."Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.	607.5184723402776
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.	352.1133950195178
Bennet.	69.40071254368596
His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill - natured tone that she"_wished_ they might be happy."Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.	801.4068392191853
As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.""_That_ you certainly shall.""And I have another favour to ask.	564.9206569707817
Will you come and see me?""We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.""I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.	467.1360824860645
Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford."Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.	1001.4276038358731
"My father and Maria are to come to me in March,"added Charlotte,"and I hope you will consent to be of the party.	396.7264107444948
Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them."The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual.	620.2663641318977
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was.	706.922709013199
Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	695.2029717972816
She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise.	1822.700888917196
The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging.	1509.6642400245098
It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.	412.3663228283213
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.	410.2272009215626
Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline.	719.1253244915912
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been lost.	791.5395240057087
"My aunt,"she continued,"is going to - morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor - street."She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.	556.0765243937431
"I did not think Caroline in spirits,"were her words,"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.	528.0144367759929
I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	478.9044801699687
He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.	567.5380332309812
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.	210.241717540908
I wish I could see her.	135.1988166148864
My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs.	488.9918569959024
Hurst were going out.	336.41623739797296
It convinced her, that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.	287.40729061891386
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.	787.1016647438581
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.	370.4416198632521
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.	923.00939225153
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt.	351.78027191834457
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.	927.1927668518148
But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	1573.1923128161138
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again.	518.1782384001816
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time.	645.9364676479038
When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	913.8731300454856
I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.	868.1458571594172
She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side.	674.4265488435809
But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.	537.4468304751239
I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.	1480.737539597206
He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.	559.1119701720974
I cannot understand it.	170.37318619660613
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.	653.2119024023648
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	853.1743485691769
Let me hear from you very soon.	283.22139883077955
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty.	599.5938302323694
We had better not mention it.	242.22310636343002
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.	694.1448080692667
I am sure you will be very comfortable there.	234.1754358068652
"Your's, & c."This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.	638.8509329745564
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.	422.02319050890395
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions.	179.38275551851183
His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.	723.0689237015907
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.	364.9856625150798
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.	1022.542336303364
Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: - -"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.	906.6505811304745
I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.	333.22271309000377
There can be no love in all this.	231.61725480222475
My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.	838.400687789431
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.	376.1921720526533
They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain."With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.	973.8529901258296
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.	272.5751736236601
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.	752.54305407381
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.	889.0743235093886
Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.	1549.680393142211
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.	376.01212417824496
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	888.5538607667883
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her - - their opinion of every body - - would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.	679.8940155059884
Her fellow - travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.	492.8608560952451
Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty - headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.	940.7320381130914
Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long.	865.2246190805304
It was a journey of only twenty - four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch - street by noon.	506.5767192980661
As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.	814.3915386736106
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing - room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	1023.036748920239
All was joy and kindness.	293.293862497917
The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.	726.8723241603583
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.	346.0203168623664
Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.	884.5390076374447
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.	982.0813029213424
"But, my dear Elizabeth,"she added,"what sort of girl is Miss King?	675.7690311971062
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.""Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	663.360032461157
Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?	1866.8678610617796
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.""If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.""She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.	550.2903624935568
I know no harm of her.""But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune.""No - - why should he?	322.0187533408104
If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?""But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event.""A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.	854.3529439221554
If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?""_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.	1470.074426515086
It only shews her being deficient in something herself - - sense or feeling.""Well,"cried Elizabeth,"have it as you choose.	584.8755011504724
_He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.""No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.	851.640127220584
I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.""Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better.	526.1587170080059
I am sick of them all.	70.78153375492255
Thank Heaven! I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him.	607.9372427414603
Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.""Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	741.9608820368385
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,"said Mrs.	624.9149972666672
Gardiner,"but perhaps to the Lakes."No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.	375.1274994618697
"My dear, dear aunt,"she rapturously cried,"what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour.	1342.829937894763
Adieu to disappointment and spleen.	737.8863645524377
What are men to rocks and mountains?	899.5201264483206
Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.	1155.791187003911
Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation.	3010.6047816094274
Let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	454.3514667466885
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	723.1855075252826
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.	669.8358695330539
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	284.1935219425645
The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving.	2084.9349901874157
Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.	711.0296158549728
In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.	509.3502522755776
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received.	763.0245057136547
She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.	408.82133987371225
They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	989.8743267564655
When Mr. Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte.	869.4994107866014
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.	746.0041585730606
He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	541.9356253897854
But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.	826.6011064204811
It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.	1153.4603866615296
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help.	1376.4576046875493
It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.	563.0202290408876
When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.	780.1626173275287
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.	311.4783174634553
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed,"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her.	952.9310120540933
She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.	518.8361753903204
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.	343.63016477083903
We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.	908.0663099220384
I _should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.""Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,"added Charlotte,"and a most attentive neighbour.""Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.	981.49316352848
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.	683.0115783594304
She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.	886.3919861130837
A lively imagination soon settled it all.	595.8391479574898
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.	1026.7706070888228
She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining - room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is.	1147.2418775272686
Make haste, and come down this moment."Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining - room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.	869.0000482881203
"And is this all?"cried Elizabeth.	161.0497269939287
"I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!""La! my dear,"said Maria quite shocked at the mistake,"it is not Lady Catherine.	521.7889154542748
The old lady is Mrs.	302.30488708647124
Jenkinson, who lives with them.	1148.1195959417128
The other is Miss De Bourgh.	349.5983605457239
Only look at her.	215.05762320181776
She is quite a little creature.	260.14895346522155
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!""She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	402.6322196241602
Why does she not come in?""Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does.	533.6809182603871
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in.""I like her appearance,"said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.	598.6932303692352
"She looks sickly and cross. - - Yes, she will do for him very well.	465.35479916773716
She will make him a very proper wife."Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.	773.6930134134312
Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.	450.3000508152146
Mr. Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.	266.51894931666175
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	536.5186564337453
"I confess,"said he,"that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings.	462.5312783528699
I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.	887.1189103862853
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!""I am the less surprised at what has happened,"replied Sir William,"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.	772.1261931737703
About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to Rosings.	841.5690405770663
Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	965.1097995570004
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.	1601.9829959593978
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter.	586.2295285899193
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more.	472.18013714135265
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.	409.3278505142884
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. - - Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.	723.7998605074549
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. - - Elizabeth's courage did not fail her.	528.3437113044449
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation.	1359.2629760906627
From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti - chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs.	1995.163094021384
Jenkinson were sitting. - - Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs.	750.1365728504985
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.	377.4758808935234
In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look.	990.5577006686627
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. - - Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly - marked features, which might once have been handsome.	974.3893035647919
Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.	966.5763073254799
She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self - importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.	643.8751674871038
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small.	848.6979362057963
There was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies.	1086.4766968307617
Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.	1000.4095532381212
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.	919.7101766762278
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.	1374.7228248128902
The party did not supply much conversation.	188.60008135574714
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh - - the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time.	464.34509475830015
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	629.7599608543876
When the ladies returned to the drawing - room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted.	647.701776279586
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.	517.4132572367366
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others.	496.51385824239003
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.	259.8413468309825
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs.	759.0727777981754
Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.	1368.774668216419
She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name? - - Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly. - - Lady Catherine then observed,"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.	997.9917125776755
For your sake,"turning to Charlotte,"I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. - - It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. - - Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?""A little.""Oh! then - - some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	473.88520834129037
Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to - - - - You shall try it some day. - - Do your sisters play and sing?""One of them does.""Why did not you all learn? - - You ought all to have learned.	367.6926520691604
The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your's. - - Do you draw?""No, not at all.""What, none of you?""Not one.""That is very strange.	372.67067873934735
But I suppose you had no opportunity.	222.4773193112384
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.""My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.""Has your governess left you?""We never had any governess.""No governess! How was that possible?	379.2845201047447
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education."Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.	362.14587158496454
"Then, who taught you?	430.14057292395904
who attended to you?	215.99928816968983
Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.""Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.	656.7754624326427
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	611.9163055179575
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way.	302.39011926748356
Four nieces of Mrs.	357.08171710992747
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.	854.4992047814171
Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me?	819.4873389758166
She finds Miss Pope a treasure.	1455.6092034181265
'Lady Catherine,'said she,'you have given me a treasure.'Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?""Yes, Ma'am, all.""All! - - What, all five out at once?	885.3635495980358
Very odd! - - And you only the second. - - The younger ones out before the elder are married! - - Your younger sisters must be very young?""Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.	448.3097522627057
But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. - - The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first.	701.4197213966752
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, - - therefore you need not conceal your age.""I am not one and twenty."When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed.	598.8972583524722
Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs.	737.6136759366248
Jenkinson to make up her party.	253.08864580212352
Their table was superlatively stupid.	1283.2995360543612
Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.	1013.1212137662886
A great deal more passed at the other table.	409.812446051831
Lady Catherine was generally speaking - - stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.	949.1571591913499
Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	812.5915232505324
He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.	469.3364454396577
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs.	810.7968021593022
Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.	3293.1959473578263
But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands.	701.9691959924098
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with.	536.9544222087115
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.	359.61513206899025
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining - parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.	518.5735771131351
From the drawing - room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.	881.069038880807
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes'conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.	819.2380613012034
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.	486.4132929124184
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.	619.1299133713386
She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs.	894.0555853810013
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.	1020.4863842128569
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first.	586.3316421534961
Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses'reach.	550.1010911321926
This however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.	552.7226304095042
Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.	1202.460944152161
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.	852.3816296859077
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.	624.2941427693112
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.	293.7775680539711
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord - - - - and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	604.2415233384497
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.	1576.704741128274
Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me."Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door - bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	587.3885158059796
Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.	1842.6604400262147
Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs.	779.9966439181491
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	895.8026785772031
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well - bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs.	782.9483686020137
Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	678.8935771135928
She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added,"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.	967.4088124268116
The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.	885.685514607414
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings.	500.5583183867938
It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter - day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.	916.2658335307442
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.	383.2012010622124
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had only seen at church.	516.1058541599593
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.	347.3754069221721
He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy.	769.4204287191964
What are you telling Miss Bennet?	193.3359644381325
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud.	714.863100955191
It is of all subjects my delight.	245.11121498924516
I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	425.37308590282265
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.	1128.2900578371236
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	606.4039605577279
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,"said Lady Catherine;"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal.""I assure you, Madam,"he replied,"that she does not need such advice.	653.2619184576976
She practises very constantly.""So much the better.	354.2946779025386
It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.	364.01370969239554
I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice.	1423.5957599834871
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.	831.9119388225635
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.	332.3362876287201
He drew a chair near her.	326.24458275867937
Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano - forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance.	1047.2436485593498
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?	968.9731139417584
But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.	438.2365412272013
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.	353.43339249697175
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.	636.7949091486774
Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire - - and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too - - for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear.""I am not afraid of you,"said he, smilingly.	844.8006847601677
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,"cried Colonel Fitzwilliam.	527.4755237030746
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball - - and at this ball, what do you think he did?	601.0226078824336
He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.	1171.770971006385
Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.""I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.""True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	318.5543076636106
Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?	2202.362976719701
My fingers wait your orders.""Perhaps,"said Darcy,"I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers.""Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.	971.7882796502279
"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?""I can answer your question,"said Fitzwilliam,"without applying to him.	848.562480548967
It is because he will not give himself the trouble.""I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,"said Darcy,"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.	526.4612444386222
I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.""My fingers,"said Elizabeth,"do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do.	890.9476652531328
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault - - because I would not take the trouble of practising.	317.6367777326162
It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution."Darcy smiled and said,"You are perfectly right.	490.74960191755935
You have employed your time much better.	171.9130729156642
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.	578.9525611016063
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy,"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master.	1093.5783685553902
She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's.	641.1654911265166
Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.	619.10821574697
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.	1230.6200140886529
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.	334.2645564712304
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.	862.51907045839
As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half - finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.	900.6640801459095
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.	637.4904018211232
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	1410.5573541655888
It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed,"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before.	871.2266080687696
He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London.""Perfectly so - - I thank you."She found that she was to receive no other answer - - and, after a short pause, added,"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?""I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future.	429.7893963805454
He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.""If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.	557.8356861548517
But perhaps Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle.""I should not be surprised,"said Darcy,"if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers."Elizabeth made no answer.	389.54194267550713
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.	467.3524502104807
He took the hint, and soon began with,"This seems a very comfortable house.	843.3594400262679
Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.""I believe she did - - and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.""Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.""Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.	402.9583407069296
My friend has an excellent understanding - - though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.	352.0136715331005
She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.""It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.""An easy distance do you call it?	527.5865766573127
It is nearly fifty miles.""And what is fifty miles of good road?	445.044711258767
"I should never have said Mrs.	140.965785454494
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.	549.6862662499982
The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.	905.3707996473203
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	1330.165448820416
But that is not the case _here_.	255.54955688692905
Mr. and Mrs.	62.137304684771436
Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys - - and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance."Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said,"_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.	693.7020793861129
_You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn."Elizabeth looked surprised.	311.42379025595704
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,"Are you pleased with Kent?"A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise - - and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk.	1311.5051598078935
"What can be the meaning of this!"said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone.	305.62855366037303
"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way."But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.	552.7618295090898
All field sports were over.	1593.2091020281246
Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.	1052.8073571802186
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.	1179.626311549724
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.	622.7850293530892
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand.	401.01822739228044
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice - - a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	561.6623147866734
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Collins knew not what to make of him.	158.10807646505702
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable.	571.055861246083
It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.	1343.2119984255103
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.	300.6301956086388
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	517.9552945757249
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.	1032.0324661263944
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. - - She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers. - - How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd! - - Yet it did, and even a third.	637.6316284831527
He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions - - about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs.	542.3487028775232
Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.	460.5380541504629
His words seemed to imply it.	521.8794835409352
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?	436.0093350261804
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.	1049.253122673528
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re - perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.	934.7868552013526
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.""I have been making the tour of the Park,"he replied,"as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.	570.6939479643595
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?"said she.	310.217743475312
He arranges the business just as he pleases.""And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice.	478.7615776256384
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.""He likes to have his own way very well,"replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.	369.23699651996435
"But so we all do.	152.26323568189656
A younger son, you know, must be inured to self - denial and dependence.""In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either.	808.8096419772459
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?""These are home questions - - and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature.	603.4273408039445
But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money.	575.5247660828178
Younger sons cannot marry where they like.""Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.""Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.""Is this,"thought Elizabeth,"meant for me?"and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone,"And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son?	930.3093138121084
Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.	897.5040498349815
I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.	708.104216538123
But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.""No,"said Colonel Fitzwilliam,"that is an advantage which he must divide with me.	805.4589250313586
Does your charge give you much trouble?	322.30005334967296
She directly replied,"You need not be frightened.	689.4618740500789
I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.	325.5581607200266
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs.	470.6814010883164
Hurst and Miss Bingley.	171.40607892394098
I think I have heard you say that you know them.""I know them a little.	151.35901425474123
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman - like man - - he is a great friend of Darcy's.""Oh! yes,"said Elizabeth drily - -"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.""Care of him! - - Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care.	496.17602900743935
From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him.	575.7276062247047
It was all conjecture.""What is it you mean?""It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing.""You may depend upon my not mentioning it.""And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.	333.531218354871
"He only told me, what I have now told you."Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.	764.8533132863968
After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.	936.0806629516215
"Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.	407.6248312553224
Why was he to be the judge?""You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?""I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy.""But,"she continued, recollecting herself,"as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	567.1414011899697
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.""That is not an unnatural surmise,"said Fitzwilliam,"but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage.	780.0534234510486
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.	300.5454607664027
There could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence.	910.5462956251856
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them.	476.55428326485145
If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.	1260.4784235488835
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.	658.2135299117317
"To Jane herself,"she exclaimed,"there could be no possibility of objection.	612.7633378005487
All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	964.673531610688
Neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach."When she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.	960.7859216490261
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.	687.4122357318109
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	1950.8624993106434
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.	967.8892874355594
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.	534.3803547422929
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.	997.8067397093281
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	747.6449831428749
She answered him with cold civility.	367.3906512609709
He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room.	715.6049094741547
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began,"In vain have I struggled.	968.9808078015405
It will not do.	140.3547396684273
My feelings will not be repressed.	377.5425934389313
This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed.	766.4983611194116
He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.	673.6756441759605
His sense of her inferiority - - of its being a degradation - - of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.	712.6296721377317
She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done.	1289.6433750020742
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.	501.44821067038043
As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.	457.0207771065713
He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.	1349.9798338065498
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said,"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned.	1195.8869792897979
It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.	862.5056343532704
But I cannot - - I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.	389.89979554532783
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one.	297.5647395613397
It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration.	1076.4539107785781
The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle - piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.	872.776786501075
His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature.	838.6337409729092
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected.	1309.6494214079537
But it is of small importance.""I might as well enquire,"replied she,"why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?	852.6948335464892
But I have other provocations.	329.1054361995761
You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind."She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	1007.2091195378496
With assumed tranquillity he then replied,"I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.	788.0908352940654
Towards _him_ I have been kinder than towards myself."Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	1135.3859145524514
"But it is not merely this affair,"she continued,"on which my dislike is founded.	632.4286653461244
On this subject, what can you have to say?	614.5924125210179
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	584.9913149892935
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?""You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,"said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	1060.5634145876138
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?""His misfortunes!"repeated Darcy contemptuously;"yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.""And of your infliction,"cried Elizabeth with energy.	481.2973771606943
You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him.	595.2844590596435
You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert.	706.6410046736835
You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule.""And this,"cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully.	335.8622785199656
My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,"added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her,"these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	1855.369537217607
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	419.8723391012499
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.	258.89402064523716
They were natural and just.	247.83040669314212
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner."She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it."Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.	552.9000704614841
She went on.	171.26363239299124
"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground - work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.""You have said quite enough, madam.	626.635500373782
I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.	391.0659234871757
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.	510.7437724810367
She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour.	544.424421582142
Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it.	980.1484186671678
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.	502.4785816797687
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	632.5399904689106
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	788.7539186389387
The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.	747.5627421960755
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.	553.0579478859077
She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating.	657.8711041685638
But the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name.	1409.1117056610624
She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate.	609.3106963671082
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"- - And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.	728.3538897110966
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. - - The envelope itself was likewise full. - - Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.	1387.570220225125
I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation, and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.	1162.1831873410383
"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	785.2496965816265
He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.	499.75587332901245
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him.	407.56810261981803
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. - - If it be so, if I have been misled by such error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable.	872.9854455660646
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. - - I will only say farther, that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. - - He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning. - - The part which I acted, is now to be explained. - - His sisters'uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. - - We accordingly went - - and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend, the certain evils of such a choice. - - I described, and enforced them earnestly. - - But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference.	873.3824863663747
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. - - But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own. - - To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point.	790.6125927176143
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. - - I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.	713.4120106294287
I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. - - That they might have met without ill consequence, is perhaps probable; - - but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. - - Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. - - It is done, however, and it was done for the best. - - On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.	609.9932641782007
Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.	968.4339912778822
Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on George Wickham, who was his god - son, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed.	660.6911384704042
My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge; - - most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education.	1079.7900437002224
My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	732.8298922509294
As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner.	625.7393310232369
The vicious propensities - - the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.	669.0704445843141
My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant.	642.6298759506947
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	542.4025285609565
His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited.	1212.9454190927877
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.	930.3615297791598
I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.	842.8228616063751
I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman.	165.87521537115214
The business was therefore soon settled.	338.16642755723495
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.	642.5235891195584
All connection between us seemed now dissolved.	1257.597069527332
I thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.	772.1033681017033
In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.	1059.3255239999557
His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.	912.8398433972869
He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question - - of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions.	694.179630544789
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	1184.1562262185932
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances - - and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others, as in his reproaches to myself.	440.0578147719097
After this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropt.	1047.0952413827465
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.	761.8342595343601
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.	501.86844049716575
Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.	485.5640669201666
My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.	1404.4394254427596
Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	872.6939426780826
She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself.	676.8422336483214
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	730.7371468847917
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.	354.66607962727
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.	965.6256557015544
Younge was of course removed from her charge.	397.0880209666871
Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a strong inducement.	822.9718053489594
This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham.	1440.580588014265
I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at.	434.2129240085324
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.	1048.2896624886805
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night.	462.2359340733861
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	308.7185953543544
If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning.	711.3765140070291
I will only add, God bless you.	1283.4263884023626
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY."If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents.	591.2927025851079
But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.	849.0546317914071
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	416.77165235971955
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	411.73901200369335
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield.	711.048512763254
She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.	758.7257010046422
His belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.	767.7407472457205
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	681.7413951190395
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	1383.6555347378353
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.	6589.6127323690625
She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming,"This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"- - and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.	891.4127513419801
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	811.7155124860677
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words.	622.6644856117359
So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great.	709.5675485963405
But when she read, and re - read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.	1350.5098245711818
She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality - - deliberated on the probability of each statement - - but with little success.	722.0447731240183
On both sides it was only assertion.	274.26542209597983
Again she read on.	381.5092789260929
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.	940.1699789489214
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.	766.7087020459878
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the - - - - shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance.	646.0475952180499
As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring.	677.5434279597118
His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	1221.6877323915407
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	1377.6096332019392
But no such recollection befriended her.	462.46590535560176
After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.	956.1516329107184
But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself - - from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.	651.9126350240866
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Philips's.	468.654933126281
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.	475.9267798950768
She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.	226.36428824870498
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.	636.4104820973039
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy - - that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week.	459.7219610453753
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	486.89772872656664
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust - - any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits.	1174.0837745563515
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued - - that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.	476.3474575445005
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.	684.4792529747839
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. - - Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.	1663.3214298403136
But vanity, not love, has been my folly. - - Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned.	1298.8778779729564
Till this moment, I never knew myself."From herself to Jane - - from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation _there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	455.9817626516628
Widely different was the effect of a second perusal. - - How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? - - He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment; - - and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been. - - Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane. - - She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.	577.7784416124111
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe.	818.9804180510454
The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.	457.65507721168825
It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family; - - and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before.	587.3217081443191
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re - considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	1072.807349694178
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. - - Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.	734.34428228536
She could think only of her letter.	173.34390204766135
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.	870.1666737474279
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.	859.083799265605
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. - -"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,"said Lady Catherine;"I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do.	468.8310745800422
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year.	940.0811320452266
Collins so before you came.	204.93249373310528
There can be no occasion for your going so soon.	334.26479462771266
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.""But my father cannot. - - He wrote last week to hurry my return.""Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. - - Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.	386.9034311374884
And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you - - and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.""You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan."Lady Catherine seemed resigned.	712.4434878736612
"Mrs.	60.18783703286048
Collins, you must send a servant with them.	569.1755970242492
You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.	735.9631036402303
You must contrive to send somebody.	536.949280695583
You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.	895.6112883939045
Collins.	83.60102438663608
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.""My uncle is to send a servant for us.""Oh! - - Your uncle! - - He keeps a man - servant, does he? - - I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things.	394.38634062772456
Where shall you change horses? - - Oh! Bromley, of course. - - If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to."Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.	794.8546712107081
Mr. Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.	349.6394331447285
She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.	1083.8617630817173
When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	718.794845992139
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.	969.7986981784134
They were hopeless of remedy.	177.4247713766246
Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	1365.4242761693413
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?	478.02644782280794
Catherine, weak - spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self - willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.	2917.7418972541536
They were ignorant, idle, and vain.	1978.776228434696
While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.	644.9373088980989
Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.	1005.4841356743533
His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.	805.0134300027158
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first.	548.2324430540609
The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	1110.4929255571499
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.	1123.4746273047463
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.	455.10850855701483
The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.	574.8356411390931
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.	506.52454587644826
Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.	894.1163021918659
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged.	644.4179133488306
Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.	400.85615083227185
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.	541.2935987335626
You see on what a footing we are.	410.8509312507358
You see how continually we are engaged there.	601.9237618968764
In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.	852.9208551195837
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.	1497.610072002586
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs.	266.6057309676807
Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate - - but on this point it will be as well to be silent.	390.5277803730059
Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.	962.7398083205228
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.	265.6502566578902
Poor Charlotte! - - it was melancholy to leave her to such society! - - But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.	365.2426694613413
Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.	1547.4106429755823
After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs.	571.0349558919539
Gardiner, though unknown.	1224.27600400989
He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.	922.4237486139153
"Good gracious!"cried Maria, after a few minutes silence,"it seems but a day or two since we first came! - - and yet how many things have happened!""A great many indeed,"said her companion with a sigh.	734.2098536012289
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice! - - How much I shall have to tell!"Elizabeth privately added,"And how much I shall have to conceal."Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.	771.8402074853065
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.	583.4896213721215
But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	420.71666992857325
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals.	477.9555784437455
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther.	1004.4714601056569
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch - street, for the town of - - - - in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room up stairs.	894.3772705436523
I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.	234.46904938260087
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better."And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern,"Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.	977.1793818563242
Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the - - - - shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.""Are they indeed?"cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	788.8658315995833
Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!""Yes,"thought Elizabeth,"_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once.	989.1657843859655
Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton.""Now I have got some news for you,"said Lydia, as they sat down to table.	1136.6130926701737
"What do you think?	228.97481431308353
It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like."Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay.	751.5881166006493
Lydia laughed, and said,"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	745.4974938081626
You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say.	574.4911531446186
I never saw such a long chin in my life.	383.38399622657516
Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	739.3245911596631
There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.	346.28229420218264
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her.	272.913519935155
Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?"Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal! As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	1447.940412909577
"How nicely we are crammed in!"cried Lydia.	552.4065188674969
"I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.	1035.9801297036227
Have you seen any pleasant men?	698.357173885428
Have you had any flirting?	577.6582781633822
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.	267.9426882869712
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.	932.028660688014
Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.	333.5405090402682
We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady, - - only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col.	1236.9576506716296
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.	1007.0572715206446
Forster.	132.17626910599208
I thought I should have died.	258.7319982896835
And _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.	1092.3944027534765
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."Their party in the dining - room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.	645.0555430801231
Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	1029.5060192751912
"Oh! Mary,"said she,"I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.	783.2619184923736
And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach.	428.2746086818159
I was ready to die of laughter.	352.3463059972097
And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"To this, Mary very gravely replied,"Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures.	1507.3238773599394
They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.	985.7517996812105
But I confess they would have no charms for _me_.	395.8093860326723
I should infinitely prefer a book."But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.	233.4021740624811
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.	550.9053581582202
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.	469.26416955417284
It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.	279.1715530906625
There was another reason too for her opposition.	444.4498592320883
She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.	536.2971939257355
The comfort to _her_, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.	1151.2148332323088
She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.	735.5664612687868
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	1085.7907417517226
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.	454.2231040781225
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.	618.4204548558299
She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.	419.7253451446664
"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong,"said she;"and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment.""Indeed,"replied Elizabeth,"I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.	576.5440253823544
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?""Blame you! Oh, no.""But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham.""No - - I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.""But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day."She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.	444.62486347694215
"This will not do,"said Elizabeth.	315.2425417840726
"You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing.	240.67975036629565
Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.	756.8289827044715
There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.	474.44842838955685
For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.	676.9429534562933
"Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief.	416.59517539363867
And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.	572.9621384360584
Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing.	333.29020971015404
I am sure you must feel it so.""Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.	393.6318027137466
Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.""Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.""There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men.	554.4654120151476
One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.""I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do.""And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.	360.56335888282604
It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	529.0016894211541
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.""Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.""Indeed I could not.	610.7290418725088
I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy.	310.8813767162151
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.	460.69215622845655
There is one point, on which I want your advice.	659.9935476891397
I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character."Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied,"Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	689.5585490443821
Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public.	378.45749317491095
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me?	565.8041323309567
The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light.	472.30721956991107
Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is.	538.1201578504301
Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.	846.6467912529879
At present I will say nothing about it.""You are quite right.	280.9785112745005
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.	707.4845801300004
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re - establish a character.	625.767281532575
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.	555.3863164595701
But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure.	1734.1169927831525
She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend.	486.26133863216
"And then,"said she,"if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.	721.7777427759927
Jane was not happy.	130.3308642547016
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley.	590.2084870309852
For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.	545.0774575727738
I told my sister Philips so the other day.	251.86801469850818
Well, he is a very undeserving young man - - and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now.	380.4247938719799
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know.""I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.""Oh, well! it is just as he chooses.	327.3172049845796
Nobody wants him to come.	477.5125044605089
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it.	381.5002180306296
Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done."But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.	777.3036386481123
Well, well, I only hope it will last.	1103.699708854495
And what sort of table do they keep?	471.0880660467284
Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say.	1199.4606839817982
If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough.	695.0822708938659
There is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say.""No, nothing at all.""A great deal of good management, depend upon it.	965.7117926984904
Yes, yes.	1458.0741248468441
_They_ will take care not to outrun their income.	808.0661044274837
_They_ will never be distressed for money.	528.1278343498843
Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.	1098.6278760349192
They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.""It was a subject which they could not mention before me.""No. It would have been strange if they had.	373.9069948099271
But I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves.	618.099588524839
Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.	821.119840421237
_I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."The first week of their return was soon gone.	256.4182260605948
The second began.	307.1953631868397
The dejection was almost universal.	754.94578269781
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.	1997.0635282862659
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard - heartedness in any of the family.	941.3185938283144
"Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!"would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.	279.7306825293924
"I am sure,"said she,"I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away.	743.9991749475812
I thought I should have broke my heart.""I am sure I shall break _mine_,"said Lydia.	482.9332087336041
Bennet.	69.40071254368596
"Oh, yes! - - if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.""A little sea - bathing would set me up for ever.""And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"added Kitty.	571.5830475766312
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn - house.	1008.2573109286615
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.	344.8907973432882
She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.	306.31229247489637
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs.	466.39544020156444
Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.	574.9099222818406
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months'acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.	550.3280400478213
Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described.	297.67581581595635
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	1366.915730494485
"I cannot see why Mrs.	208.3603896549338
Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,"said she,"though I am _not_ her particular friend.	646.0413458777241
I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned.	568.499290126928
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs.	479.17015694942705
Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home.	762.0029663123925
He heard her attentively, and then said,"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.""If you were aware,"said Elizabeth,"of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.""Already arisen!"repeated Mr. Bennet.	603.1680974967511
"What, has she frightened away some of your lovers?	851.1801582977457
Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down.	502.8187056598034
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret.	1224.885604403161
It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.	1007.1549632223002
Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character.	894.9363843937718
Excuse me - - for I must speak plainly.	188.12161230446324
A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.	1263.538130658401
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended.	787.7305709763409
Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.	1149.9455018513665
Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of - - or I may say, three very silly sisters.	650.6672598762212
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton.	435.56753320740756
Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body.	575.908341399826
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.	492.384902620142
The officers will find women better worth their notice.	745.1856517886215
Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance.	1271.933643858647
It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	1249.1284737716703
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.	1228.7917388549256
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility.	780.1581693523696
In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.	1249.3695610960128
She saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	1416.7781031693078
She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown.	608.9351593492895
She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.	1740.4009262549253
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?	854.1070166568035
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.	154.7717072315217
Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.	638.6416592170349
She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.	1158.9032732701078
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	995.705985247854
Her answer was warmly in his favour.	157.3795321206072
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added,"How long did you say that he was at Rosings?""Nearly three weeks.""And you saw him frequently?""Yes, almost every day.""His manners are very different from his cousin's.""Yes, very different.	504.8886864150315
But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.""Indeed!"cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her.	266.95986326087615
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style?	838.9036189144164
for I dare not hope,"he continued in a lower and more serious tone,"that he is improved in essentials.""Oh, no!"said Elizabeth.	455.41357302838134
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added,"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents,"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right.	838.6417723866659
His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.	1421.9029434244947
I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe.	1408.4881875409021
His fear of her, has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart."Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head.	710.4222771614831
The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.	1057.1065304288363
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs.	924.9470821748882
Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	771.80091760516
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.	380.67038001086024
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	653.6169399397975
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort.	566.1080267721387
He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.	346.61280380198934
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.	325.99144714979053
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband.	437.1628270172254
She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.	985.2209239785075
But she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill - judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	880.0480380749808
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	553.2487524234296
Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp.	1288.7724494003498
Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.	1333.1685799733139
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.	646.9403355107463
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	354.046309232782
"But it is fortunate,"thought she,"that I have something to wish for.	376.6164783763722
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized.	687.935220322734
Those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs.	813.0529558223693
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re - appear at Longbourn.	993.1648927762329
Everything wore a happier aspect.	811.9998909439254
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	703.9957981270771
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war - office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.	1009.1381879863048
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs.	460.95623191208307
In that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs.	566.6605211294586
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	664.2397072659062
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.	1633.377302230039
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	276.744795471994
But it was her business to be satisfied - - and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.	202.12794628455342
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.	857.215388071568
"But surely,"said she,"I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."The period of expectation was now doubled.	1111.4036214673997
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival.	448.8504981679526
Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn.	1416.5308798363542
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way - - teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	1399.6988308080372
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.	558.7294688993339
One enjoyment was certain - - that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences - - cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure - - and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.	777.7064788059936
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, & c.	2556.6071622600502
are sufficiently known.	467.4290571619896
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern.	404.86428102842495
Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.	1262.5424985112786
It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.	557.6618636333938
In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs.	988.9721901285321
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.	349.38571834794857
Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.	545.8098153372471
"A place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected.	548.8999844524086
Wickham passed all his youth there, you know."Elizabeth was distressed.	454.84435883390006
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.	541.4475306950617
She must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	999.5255169349377
Gardiner abused her stupidity.	778.1999696190993
"If it were merely a fine house richly furnished,"said she,"I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.	580.0104222220706
The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.	1218.521796803855
It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk.	423.55851265235026
But against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	794.7730304603556
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer.	1276.2982495804292
A most welcome negative followed the last question - - and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.	690.7054985214638
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	1349.7286867452003
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	900.3878251599125
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.	777.1382340147314
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.	620.698291157327
They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.	1425.8416030019098
Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.	5537.595857012975
Elizabeth was delighted.	141.84804715498885
They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something! They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned.	777.2125132843958
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.	554.8617472158402
On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.	670.3097166920916
The housekeeper came; a respectable - looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	1518.049083887836
It was a large, well - proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.	1987.1412582015018
The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.	3198.513607471693
Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight.	862.1829556324946
As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.	851.1980820104867
The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.	1276.0119268181709
"And of this place,"thought she,"I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. - - But no,"- - recollecting herself, - -"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them."This was a lucky recollection - - it saved her from something like regret.	542.82030607687
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it.	772.7720896498568
At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.	1061.3928603465586
Reynolds replied, that he was, adding,"but we expect him to - morrow, with a large party of friends."How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day! Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.	600.4764144567521
She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle - piece.	1361.7997270302708
Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	1654.4250191668013
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence. - -"He is now gone into the army,"she added,"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."Mrs.	627.8527924536774
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.	451.98216245232743
"And that,"said Mrs.	295.5438354155874
It was drawn at the same time as the other - - about eight years ago.""I have heard much of your master's fine person,"said Mrs.	358.7707292192973
But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not."Mrs.	619.132357868151
"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"Elizabeth coloured, and said - -"A little.""And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?""Yes, very handsome.""I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	347.26386138673996
This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then.	681.8878911747632
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.	721.365397273249
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?"said Mr. Gardiner.	191.44289553339914
"Oh! yes - - the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished! - - She plays and sings all day long.	439.85200381546684
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her - - a present from my master; she comes here to - morrow with him."Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs.	551.9636552454357
Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.	660.670338987857
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?""Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.""Except,"thought Elizabeth,"when she goes to Ramsgate.""If your master would marry, you might see more of him.""Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.	502.308159678555
Gardiner smiled.	255.89747866178485
Elizabeth could not help saying,"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.""I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him,"replied the other.	565.030788494111
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,"I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old."This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.	671.6612697828102
That he was not a good - tempered man, had been her firmest opinion.	356.37363192178395
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying,"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.	639.9570307270063
But I have always observed, that they who are good - natured when children, are good - natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest - tempered, most generous - hearted, boy in the world."Elizabeth almost stared at her. - -"Can this be Mr. Darcy!"thought she.	565.391642827048
"His father was an excellent man,"said Mrs.	459.7854037435538
"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him - - just as affable to the poor."Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.	832.6348738919257
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Reynolds could interest her on no other point.	350.64102218395163
She related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.	932.2138187212413
"He is the best landlord, and the best master,"said she,"that ever lived.	807.0746497459937
Not like the wild young men now - a - days, who think of nothing but themselves.	593.9527493152328
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name.	377.19343654077596
Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it.	385.33025353315327
To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.""In what an amiable light does this place him!"thought Elizabeth.	604.8533197438574
"This fine account of him,"whispered her aunt, as they walked,"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.""Perhaps we might be deceived.""That is not very likely; our authority was too good."On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting - room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley.	921.6778440166543
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room.	774.7768702854192
"And this is always the way with him,"she added. - -"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.	384.74983902412885
There is nothing he would not do for her."The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed - rooms, were all that remained to be shewn.	435.5020152374478
In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.	1237.4035563911714
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.	464.8225511601787
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.	290.61668320660334
At last it arrested her - - and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her.	581.6110406475728
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.	559.7914586394267
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time.	506.9335074045163
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance.	581.5388030216451
Reynolds was of no trifling nature.	390.7084246014508
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?	694.9747075578125
As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship! - - How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! - - How much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.	684.6424673606658
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	1052.3634172907223
As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.	870.2626760868715
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	950.297031401916
Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush.	1286.3865066976402
He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.	1574.9580147906545
She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome.	1156.150152214309
Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it.	883.0624399348839
Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life.	595.1226631674448
Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.	728.0742854704696
At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.	1270.0648031202165
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.	1035.7426242934375
She was overpowered by shame and vexation.	403.9576738930611
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?	707.0592606977903
Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	982.697288947223
That he should even speak to her was amazing! - - but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.	609.7669204334602
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it.	675.6773770956729
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene.	562.9819679356369
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was.	615.813503677345
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him.	519.9720474942571
Perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was not like ease.	729.1090461240458
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.	549.0316303617608
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.	1410.1733782850422
Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.	539.2208228360661
With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round.	1392.7429989315297
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice - wood which bordered it.	1337.3674286160574
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs.	827.8978864191724
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met.	780.0265906539147
Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.	1158.871228313567
For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.	1516.9959199430234
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.	553.4456577250712
Her colour changed, and she said no more.	628.9495506635321
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	529.8823537269129
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself.	782.3726353726296
"What will be his surprise,"thought she,"when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of fashion."The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.	750.5959121355644
That he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner.	1045.0236544403538
Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.	419.709866805452
It was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.	613.9839305662011
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.	1584.1751068976373
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder.	1138.40181929267
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.	396.97668572927626
It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened.	661.0183986399893
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.	479.7935207958793
It is impossible that he should still love me."After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water - plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	1029.7507832139192
Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's.	1605.5674881093194
Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.	410.30374178991036
After a short silence, the lady first spoke.	880.529378737049
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected - -"for your housekeeper,"she added,"informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country."He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	548.0081266244708
"They will join me early to - morrow,"he continued,"and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you, - - Mr. Bingley and his sisters."Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.	508.33053890951686
"There is also one other person in the party,"he continued after a pause,"who more particularly wishes to be known to you, - - Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.	583.2485523879476
They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.	386.60090416536383
His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind.	417.8220689772211
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.	648.3703549417311
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.	355.3678126494975
He then asked her to walk into the house - - but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.	476.37956489396277
At such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.	733.3354151247772
She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject.	920.9657025239667
At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.	1034.8625393304264
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly - - and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête - à - tête was over.	538.2560090287019
On Mr. and Mrs.	107.754598486141
Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.	802.1286382710892
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	359.7964967207533
"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure,"replied her aunt,"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.	747.1706766088662
It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention.	291.816892404472
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.""To be sure, Lizzy,"said her aunt,"he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good.	608.904462697659
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds."Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.	640.2129574235595
Gardiner,"I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor Wickham.	573.195244442269
He has not an ill - natured look.	331.9530192061125
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.	1156.318564239619
And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.	410.7758432906336
But to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.	911.7260726907906
But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.	662.9068638529153
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	576.9974186083726
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.	306.66845002569517
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.	624.6361141125666
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street.	631.5026408030924
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected.	1494.2186596913743
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.	544.6430980797795
Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.	614.2213421484869
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	702.545327707655
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.	790.1748734067186
With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	432.8950481999421
Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy.	652.9707146937725
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.	564.1267809030588
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.	1145.9122240287786
She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.	560.3092560606026
Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.	838.7291501460526
They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.	479.82303332965716
All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again.	915.0443826371111
He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good - humoured ease that he had ever done.	456.8210259714341
To Mr. and Mrs.	103.26164975667473
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.	450.3010316555908
The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.	1644.2864058464568
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.	696.7003992837708
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.	468.87486022189563
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.	646.4011797531971
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	660.2272801382577
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner.	777.0647659184227
But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.	544.0570373073535
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.	416.5895073609125
He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it"was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;"and, before she could reply, he added,"It is above eight months.	629.1140621599872
We have not met since the <NUM> th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield."Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.	795.866805430307
There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.	630.1540587327002
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.	1005.1605873430099
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.	1121.6409206375508
Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self - consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.	980.7759230353449
Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.	1159.8731774640605
Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.	676.2432977697206
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.	1228.520945688528
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.	599.9572670768487
Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little.	1112.3057867420034
Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	788.0042441663304
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.	223.00304394467835
They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	942.2414717247044
Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.	475.95049924332034
They could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy.	804.1356543271336
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.	1044.205728580334
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market - town, where the family did not visit.	741.8917068740636
It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	697.08738101903
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.	1041.5468487864098
She certainly did not hate him.	273.2042953780593
It was gratitude. - - Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	1149.0160258538237
He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.	2070.1163759021397
She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	686.1241993519931
It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.	867.1645720135313
They were, therefore, to go. - - Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	903.0567624101257
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.	734.5981439513208
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be renewed.	646.3264337175345
On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	1489.2626136658016
Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	1980.0302307234842
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs.	534.3496664152527
Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.	426.98771002327527
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.	739.0545492364273
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.	1433.8188411912877
By Mrs.	195.88844419514425
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.	1205.1140381340444
It was first broken by Mrs.	324.35947271541283
Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.	732.1128520654111
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	583.4352910761247
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention.	635.048712793969
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.	466.5139501506745
Her own thoughts were employing her.	550.6122255180593
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.	290.6785370781654
She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.	613.6096414911308
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.	1143.635313786666
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.	616.3110635726189
There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table.	1464.3863852851928
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.	701.9982173539289
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning.	577.8263197216293
No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; - - a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.	762.447934245402
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over.	540.9302707650696
Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	911.4995787756519
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the - - - - shire militia removed from Meryton?	1331.9904436087706
While she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.	1316.3501338500428
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps.	797.4712502268263
He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.	650.0610193354844
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.	1659.1128133769662
Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	1062.2446393544199
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above - mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	684.9122933933826
But Georgiana would not join her.	248.2478738967324
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.	738.2599638239654
When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.	458.152111409425
"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,"she cried;"I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	510.06087124948203
She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again."However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, - - no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.	847.4053873814465
"For my own part,"she rejoined,"I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her.	593.4950188314414
Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.	244.4563705855154
Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines.	771.1583046155632
They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self - sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable."Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.	957.5686935338776
He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued,"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield,'_She_ a beauty! - - I should as soon call her mother a wit.'But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.""Yes,"replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer,"but _that_ was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.	733.4240670534673
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.	1076.309709351871
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.	785.7121780280048
Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs.	380.4827776730576
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.	381.71318870584156
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.	649.8121349565067
Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.	485.0292389762075
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.	491.0087269236832
The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago.	521.467487236435
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence.	1350.354540998253
It was to this effect:"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you - - be assured that we are all well.	657.3842067847289
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! - - Imagine our surprise.	925.8306642807638
To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.	1647.9421674098428
I am very, very sorry.	542.2104509567102
So imprudent a match on both sides! - - But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.	345.5411157939851
His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.	691.4991555407836
My father bears it better.	516.6331995960679
How thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves.	651.0841200431872
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight.	1856.7311952846696
The express was sent off directly.	488.5627189265106
My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.	864.4947860168882
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.	599.4841256221205
Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention.	737.0380092575623
I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother.	595.6240105064162
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written."Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	784.390843537158
Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	754.4722002101047
Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.	625.5508407254846
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express.	1317.0928584669364
Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs.	297.8005724665801
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F.	821.3496582884852
who instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.	1559.875838489476
intending to trace their route.	1005.9516889043144
All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.	524.1864765320609
I know not what to think.	114.02469916635506
After making every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F.	1674.9812438794713
came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such people had been seen to pass through.	1792.2379986074802
With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.	718.4077875184723
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs.	218.95858987301978
F.	297.5187171283365
but no one can throw any blame on them.	197.146827283342
Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.	1576.6922757251614
My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.	444.9995300801128
I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F.	1813.8807397013538
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W.	680.2531727228366
was not a man to be trusted.	127.47186159887424
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room.	476.6942317924507
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder.	362.1400947128752
I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?	1010.4675396033374
I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	1351.2025882596868
I take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not, but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here, as soon as possible.	888.0382185004963
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former.	493.30589927382607
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.	606.0750010467954
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.""Oh! where, where is my uncle?"cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared.	715.5409025839709
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed,"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.	1451.2063549731117
I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.""Good God! what is the matter?"cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself,"I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs.	682.1484838917273
Gardiner.	101.00232003668582
You are not well enough; - - you cannot go yourself."Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	717.7993352049263
Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly.	2991.9998288094744
On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,"Let me call your maid.	1559.112745275035
Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief? - - A glass of wine; - - shall I get you one? - - You are very ill.""No, I thank you;"she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.	508.6025917976413
"There is nothing the matter with me.	185.56939665486786
I am quite well.	168.32256740488384
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.	554.348990578187
Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.	1773.3243601915083
At length, she spoke again.	1069.9562128212876
"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news.	414.1479082467632
It cannot be concealed from any one.	145.28819958390076
My youngest sister has left all her friends - - has eloped; - - has thrown herself into the power of - - of Mr. Wickham.	307.96195376318025
They are gone off together from Brighton.	529.1900303392366
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.	304.9767868194068
She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to - - she is lost for ever."Darcy was fixed in astonishment.	547.8634870883861
"When I consider,"she added, in a yet more agitated voice,"that _I_ might have prevented it! - - _I_ who knew what he was.	680.6634125932732
But it is all, all too late now.""I am grieved, indeed,"cried Darcy;"grieved - - shocked.	581.53783869984
But is it certain, absolutely certain?""Oh yes! - - They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.""And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?""My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour.	852.1197058461161
How is such a man to be worked on?	312.87536976804506
I have not the smallest hope.	143.96423781243942
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character. - - Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not - - I was afraid of doing too much.	421.00896179158696
He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy.	1150.922312816356
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	696.3460146501473
Her power was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.	1261.3584524851144
She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self - conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	1590.8213169180167
It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.	836.0214293118323
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.	1591.252156549957
Lydia - - the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,"I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.	1484.098090958533
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress. - - But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.	752.7282022990471
This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to - day.""Oh, yes.	762.6478594068687
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy.	431.49076486641354
Say that urgent business calls us home immediately.	1819.0734476815335
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible. - - I know it cannot be long."He readily assured her of his secrecy - - again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away.	890.4400986524346
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.	979.9280403361605
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.	786.5552214152657
But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill - success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment.	1076.0972436465372
Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her.	745.5848907980547
No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.	993.0175440210336
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement.	421.0511169647953
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise - - all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible.	660.7928998396169
But now it was all too natural.	230.64807258321298
Sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.	1277.1400554959482
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl. - - Oh! how acutely did she now feel it.	371.97774899335946
Mr. and Mrs.	62.137304684771436
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; - - but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy. - - Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs.	1147.4252992876252
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected.	376.0358743850214
They were to be off as soon as possible.	213.22463247812044
Gardiner.	101.00232003668582
"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; - - was it so?""Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.	283.9682293517737
_That_ is all settled.""That is all settled;"repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.	220.91568977346225
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!"But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.	479.86926759089425
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure.	654.2452348173595
An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.	1004.493012031046
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,"said her uncle, as they drove from the town;"and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter.	697.6875330858842
It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best.	958.1552045471454
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?	480.0015147750942
His temptation is not adequate to the risk.""Do you really think so?"cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	541.4903361581335
"Upon my word,"said Mrs.	469.50940952683004
Gardiner,"I begin to be of your uncle's opinion.	345.9542683752023
Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?""Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.	1113.386702033531
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable.	325.57119563322084
If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it.	671.7841986742762
Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?""In the first place,"replied Mr. Gardiner,"there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.""Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.""Well, then - - supposing them to be in London.	641.7158048228736
They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.	1176.1212265903816
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.""But why all this secrecy?	909.3381308128069
Why any fear of detection?	765.886066410923
His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.	765.1143102809397
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.	437.43595267764397
He cannot afford it.	253.15453627753303
And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?	2443.6427146100527
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.	269.41482324795186
But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.	552.247713664608
Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.""But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?""It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,"replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes,"that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.	668.7414341453335
But, really, I know not what to say.	724.709550753278
Perhaps I am not doing her justice.	284.0652016204882
But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.	627.2089390299285
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	530.4246325502146
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater - - what shall I call it?	462.52103318117037
susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.	471.4836711367548
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.""But you see that Jane,"said her aunt,"does not think so ill of Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.""Of whom does Jane ever think ill?	513.3791049514972
And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?	1128.1492648878932
But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.	774.816080368529
We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word.	382.4938344626305
That he has neither integrity nor honour.	773.5785661470438
That he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating.""And do you really know all this?"cried Mrs.	423.84253221161094
Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	380.3896589104495
"I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	763.7967115303295
From what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl.	1300.2079836763173
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?""Oh, yes! - - that, that is the worst of all.	380.1321306065333
Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.	596.7263768391396
As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	874.9408578174719
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs.	297.2542233713051
Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.	481.6173251766049
That _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.	524.2944638552623
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.	619.808634813579
When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were.	339.2900026284191
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.	384.8685726013655
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.	1974.8722581151178
They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner - time the next day.	925.4262297762764
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	1271.0264144532541
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.	1404.7778313700792
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives.	1330.3178735669387
"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope every thing will be well.""Is my father in town?""Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word.""And have you heard from him often?""We have heard only once.	377.9764642318348
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do.	785.7243842198652
He merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention.""And my mother - - How is she?	490.13597471320554
How are you all?""My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.	584.7087002556199
She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.	487.2021019118499
She does not yet leave her dressing - room.	185.83935538147804
Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven! are quite well.""But you - - How are you?"cried Elizabeth.	361.40838223146824
"You look pale.	355.71488669454203
How much you must have gone through!"Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.	734.8073692144884
Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party.	695.5582274220978
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.	698.0208772429849
When they were all in the drawing - room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give.	605.8755348937742
The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	1260.5273840857856
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing.	1386.0534718454842
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?	638.7968633954459
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after.	459.92035569613057
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was over - ruled, as I always am.	374.7660755989122
The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do."They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.	632.7296719494506
"Do not give way to useless alarm,"added he,"though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.	618.0033686340668
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.	392.3475413926743
In a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost.	969.6361913157097
As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.""Oh! my dear brother,"replied Mrs.	621.0418039714107
Bennet,"that is exactly what I could most wish for.	367.01165998853116
And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married.	1032.0487755432255
And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.	1594.6085771159733
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, - - that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.	1355.26014549754
Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all."But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.	757.5931740982893
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.	844.638415784555
In the dining - room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before.	980.8798226218586
One came from her books, and the other from her toilette.	591.5781941401434
The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty.	1217.7795370072472
As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,"This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.	680.0254166361599
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable - - that one false step involves her in endless ruin - - that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful, - - and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.	1037.3701082232037
Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.	1294.763228786707
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy.	769.131330184514
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying,"But tell me all and every thing about it, which I have not already heard.	936.9709194778735
Give me farther particulars.	908.0088553501752
What did Colonel Forster say?	652.1387861182582
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place?	325.1725749245357
They must have seen them together for ever.""Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.	614.696578367847
I am so grieved for him.	173.01805979214785
He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.""And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?	706.8237791408058
Did he know of their intending to go off?	465.6598255877674
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?""Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.	782.4668168733452
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying - - and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.""And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?""How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a little uneasy - - a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.	607.6934840616924
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be.	495.91890304779844
Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step.	771.5008446971233
She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks.""But not before they went to Brighton?""No, I believe not.""And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?	576.9927217696602
Does he know his real character?""I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did.	233.12999996195649
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.	315.495080934403
"But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.	1142.9458368524001
We acted with the best intentions.""Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?""He brought it with him for us to see."Jane then took it from her pocket - book, and gave it to Elizabeth.	407.94389062146325
These were the contents:"MY DEAR HARRIET,"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning, as soon as I am missed.	853.5489645915588
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia Wickham.	820.8521771629898
What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing.	434.4860739975611
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.	666.5253399341241
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up.	810.6970131299499
Good bye.	73.97429596343663
"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.	353.0347234303168
But at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.	512.8635554743062
My poor father! how he must have felt it!""I never saw any one so shocked.	310.03830768223423
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes.	409.3023580745501
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!""Oh! Jane,"cried Elizabeth,"was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?""I do not know. - - I hope there was. - - But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult.	434.31893325565244
My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties.""Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.	695.276748265719
Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.""Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.	567.6236230751772
She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us.""She had better have stayed at home,"cried Elizabeth;"perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours.	849.0341905368794
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.	678.4548590221451
"He meant, I believe,"replied Jane,"to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them.	1426.3662687043582
His principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.	624.091005542888
It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham.	740.0356735617157
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.	569.0958074510502
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this."The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.	459.0809443192132
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.	672.7908000450634
Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	307.092696158918
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.	856.7081330055287
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.	434.41205537817314
She shared in their attendance on Mrs.	543.4044109568356
Bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	647.5010175101088
Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.	1638.680902833804
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.	1183.9191308266365
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.	540.8452823818845
Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.	751.7253160437135
That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.	881.4479625956448
Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	650.9442383870681
He added, that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon.	1127.632396708592
There was also a postscript to this effect.	388.71521823474404
At present we have nothing to guide us.	516.1973692987875
Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	886.4495037286932
She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years.	741.7484896188199
It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the - - - - shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.	645.4048696538142
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.	352.5760944545803
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	434.82859275429627
Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.	1235.7761989603944
But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.	1018.3818140154926
Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs.	2096.704249240001
Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.	1112.140843558598
No arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.	896.651726918341
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.	214.43991759447206
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs.	992.2799738718244
Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.	955.7776973360207
Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs.	880.3620863157139
Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.	687.2717880307082
They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family.	1331.3497193303951
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.	1092.5308551913595
Let me advise you then, my dear Sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.	1179.3113173186957
"I am, dear Sir, & c.	1400.9784996809524
& c."Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.	440.69782359849177
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.	599.3100885293314
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.	468.15251069367724
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to give any news of him.	542.8176332564316
And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount.	942.7154645454627
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton.	588.72430467802
He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.	648.9067597221532
Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror.	408.715528740433
"This is wholly unexpected.	287.9882814778662
Rendered spiritless by the ill - success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother - in - law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.	528.738375896296
When Mrs.	146.76769426648835
Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.	592.0419418380127
"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!"she cried.	683.1711285848488
Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"As Mrs.	821.1615377277652
Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.	378.0918516531694
The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.	1602.4289252668534
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.	426.13281165865936
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half - expectation which Mrs.	357.79186578356257
Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.	789.0330905113601
The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better.	1555.7856916053274
It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.	1147.0718649474088
When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.	575.9778917124761
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.	273.87945472650597
It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied,"Say nothing of that.	996.0978392397657
Who should suffer but myself?	626.3563921718364
It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.""You must not be too severe upon yourself,"replied Elizabeth.	470.1890078124488
"You may well warn me against such an evil.	508.11242843174017
Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame.	995.517258273247
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.	172.50804269594718
It will pass away soon enough.""Do you suppose them to be in London?""Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?""And Lydia used to want to go to London,"added Kitty.	328.8096688380266
"She is happy, then,"said her father, drily;"and her residence there will probably be of some duration."Then, after a short silence, he continued,"Lizzy, I bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.	1203.4512747562346
"This is a parade,"cried he,"which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can, - - or, perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away.""I am not going to run away, Papa,"said Kitty, fretfully;"if _I_ should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.""_You_ go to Brighton! - - I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.	1043.3423308208019
No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village.	886.0761133959862
Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.	1183.5945628324992
And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	971.8880702783933
"Well, well,"said he,"do not make yourself unhappy.	1048.1965008346654
If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them."Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet,"I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.""What do you mean, Hill?	862.8831631663483
We have heard nothing from town.""Dear madam,"cried Mrs.	545.2377664005156
Hill, in great astonishment,"don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner?	929.8589326580194
He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter."Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	668.5571089822138
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library; - - their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said,"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse."Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.	940.5755327628503
Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out,"Oh, Papa, what news?	2636.1235477219866
what news?	322.64055005883324
have you heard from my uncle?""Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.""Well, and what news does it bring?	437.1666647535617
good or bad?""What is there of good to be expected?"said he, taking the letter from his pocket;"but perhaps you would like to read it."Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.	297.61450834299956
Jane now came up.	273.7692320371587
"Read it aloud,"said their father,"for I hardly know myself what it is about.""Gracechurch - street, Monday, August <NUM>.	1171.840920630805
Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were.	614.3419577204319
The particulars, I reserve till we meet.	1068.838350186218
It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them both - - - -""Then it is, as I always hoped,"cried Jane;"they are married!"Elizabeth read on;"I have seen them both.	359.57421512606066
They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.	433.0257367089493
These are conditions, which, considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.	2296.008964093723
I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.	604.43037652697
You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.	553.350634581908
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.	735.4358829285094
If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.	1145.056809367152
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.	811.479868769109
Send back your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly.	970.7457901709189
We have judged it best, that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve.	759.5503057629024
Your's, & c.	1064.2437979634342
"EDW.	263.007147788387
GARDINER.""Is it possible!"cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.	416.42823920054553
"Can it be possible that he will marry her?""Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;"said her sister.	397.89974021259064
"My dear father, I congratulate you.""And have you answered the letter?"said Elizabeth.	279.3996826073869
"No; but it must be done soon."Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.	405.52107563343213
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case.""Let me write for you,"said Jane,"if you dislike the trouble yourself.""I dislike it very much,"he replied;"but it must be done."And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.	580.3617982886096
"And may I ask?"said Elizabeth,"but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.""Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.""And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!""Yes, yes, they must marry.	680.692940330054
There is nothing else to be done.	249.17043139294995
But there are two things that I want very much to know: - - one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him.""Money! my uncle!"cried Jane,"what do you mean, Sir?""I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a - year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.""That is very true,"said Elizabeth;"though it had not occurred to me before.	597.5568957355371
His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself.	1074.1019579277463
Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast - room.	483.8706609607129
"And they are really to be married!"cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.	350.8377329114253
"How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful.	252.67160833147832
That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!""I comfort myself with thinking,"replied Jane,"that he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.	909.1290273381206
He has children of his own, and may have more.	409.9532042588558
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?""If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,"said Elizabeth,"and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.	718.7673327762345
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.	1317.0498742931127
By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!""We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,"said Jane:"I hope and trust they will yet be happy.	549.7604876460317
His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.	640.431311880479
It is useless to talk of it."It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	240.1812260700317
They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her.	690.5619100678946
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.	251.58593710673392
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet could hardly contain herself.	351.88814233976575
As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.	911.8761776737308
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.	707.14306880923
To know that her daughter would be married was enough.	255.94393120970793
"My dear, dear Lydia!"she cried:"This is delightful indeed! - - She will be married! - - I shall see her again! - - She will be married at sixteen! - - My good, kind brother! - - I knew how it would be - - I knew he would manage every thing.	429.0178716589302
Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.	986.920925761092
Stay, stay, I will go myself.	2697.038506645244
My dear, dear Lydia! - - How merry we shall be together when we meet!"Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	825.693858846797
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,"she added,"in a great measure, to his kindness.	1110.4197933343364
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.""Well,"cried her mother,"it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?	473.0865710782891
If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.	470.70607276021957
Well! I am so happy.	228.3204341766886
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married.	550.1380867498267
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Wickham! How well it sounds.	493.4290334905142
And she was only sixteen last June.	574.2169364049163
Other schemes too came into her head.	737.8387594181635
"I will go to Meryton,"said she,"as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips.	646.4377564069158
And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs.	522.7976676309046
Long.	153.36327455690133
Kitty, run down and order the carriage.	445.51848926938044
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.	724.0886654970592
Girls, can I do any thing for you in Meryton?	780.7501176366936
Oh! here comes Hill.	541.1017041093514
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."Mrs.	439.96138751137255
Hill began instantly to express her joy.	449.2494488816627
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.	1123.5060640807485
Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him.	1488.5297624936143
He now wished it more than ever.	306.9817919123652
Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	693.3830435969088
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.	1015.2518752004718
He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother - in - law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.	824.558297592325
When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.	824.3898669057115
This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.	537.5892419564898
Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.	709.0470995809644
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would.	854.3559171030605
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.	638.7307380763602
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.	863.2579891852025
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.	988.7885534605571
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents.	490.82980437758505
This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.	627.5167865905005
He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement.	559.5307551739392
He would scarcely be ten pounds a - year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum.	1009.0439338704277
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible.	777.1953895438418
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	910.1174567900318
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any message to her.	435.85438491023444
The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.	999.6271829673283
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy.	277.1479114297358
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house.	1036.1533695467124
It was a fortnight since Mrs.	237.28082038483825
Bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high.	760.3686305803001
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.	1422.1134243965034
Into _one_ house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.	1740.0009458867694
I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs.	466.06898057661306
Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.	1146.5304898054874
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion.	645.8677902405095
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet could hardly comprehend it.	268.37070552457146
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible.	1029.1445288998054
She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they took place.	880.9129001002517
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot.	614.0630518477334
She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.	1008.1967396471584
Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.	2130.2122660446776
Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.	747.36764766213
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	411.1934436845751
The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.	846.9516076806377
She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.	947.5511384996763
She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.	633.6071289027341
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet.	284.9257691530064
But while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.	664.8255593829625
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.	923.0033244799799
His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	1135.5494020861331
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.	768.6155061155292
An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.	803.9188189563647
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine.	637.0364029711455
* * * * * Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.	529.211925804465
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia.	545.1350065493111
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,"he added,"as soon as his marriage was fixed on.	433.5011923491654
And I think you will agree with me, in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's.	614.5958916995463
It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.	516.7221024365305
He has the promise of an ensigncy in General - - - -'s regiment, now quartered in the North.	681.548193275867
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.	280.6340423668607
He promises fairly, and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent.	1652.2633535928705
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list, according to his information.	961.1237689918187
He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us.	330.19913398957186
Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week.	888.5192929611566
They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.	587.1977047461232
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all, before she leaves the South.	743.9099479765446
She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother. - - Your's, & c.	623.4325196741656
"E.	263.007147788387
GARDINER."Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the - - - - shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do.	344.31430236950405
But Mrs.	108.18238850862897
Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites.	748.2658315877835
"She is so fond of Mrs.	153.6236769968414
But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.	840.2798585599529
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North.	466.11540459636825
When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.	565.7178674479158
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.	333.58458642058287
The carriage was sent to meet them at - - - -, and they were to return in it, by dinner - time.	398.9658822781547
They came.	184.2044673829799
The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them.	344.0750574905238
Bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.	1672.7478633119372
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.	333.23659982423584
Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.	1785.1704728726622
Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.	854.1293472825369
His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.	657.431540214273
The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.	1234.1336694230392
Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked.	653.2159575044233
Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.	7105.139416312337
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.	1235.6240016026672
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	989.4999403906559
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.	873.1715943393975
_She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	1345.8898826812197
There was no want of discourse.	255.6331300052943
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies.	895.7190722316379
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.	302.9080603283707
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.	454.9591977192253
"Only think of its being three months,"she cried,"since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time.	542.7908591706323
Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was."Her father lifted up his eyes.	500.7536859982614
Jane was distressed.	168.87536572685798
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,"Oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married to - day?	1003.7266552835218
I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like any thing."Elizabeth could bear it no longer.	947.8741477124022
She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining - parlour.	611.8130326399195
Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called"Mrs.	954.2651241973306
Hill and the two housemaids.	369.3685232570118
"Well, mamma,"said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room,"and what do you think of my husband?	632.5597280923755
Is not he a charming man?	341.0197114952385
I am sure my sisters must all envy me.	421.798705981097
They must all go to Brighton.	258.17448167765576
That is the place to get husbands.	340.67766849044733
But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off.	696.7841640245477
Must it be so?""Oh, lord! yes; - - there is nothing in that.	424.5341670954407
I shall like it of all things.	185.29320621565947
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.""I should like it beyond any thing!"said her mother.	426.4317189862991
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.""I thank you for my share of the favour,"said Elizabeth;"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.	448.7003657033204
Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	359.27309070392766
No one but Mrs.	206.72851244245635
These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.	375.371337140688
Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him.	340.60967991778665
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.	228.276841939132
He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.	561.0029698851845
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.	1320.511216840476
You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it.	638.2307467621445
We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish.	1233.625736520634
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock.	574.5959994081637
And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.	578.1850449466837
However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.	1217.2928814376423
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.	563.4525260153843
If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.	925.6512506821214
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	1737.044398237675
To be sure London was rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open.	612.7552088578283
Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.	729.2104174744488
Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day.	513.3416612930835
But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	1673.0028627301028
However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.""Mr. Darcy!"repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.	892.3759059025933
"Oh, yes! - - he was to come there with Wickham, you know.	481.16184798594645
But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it.	332.2266518702216
I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say?	638.3850035904163
You may depend upon my seeking no further.""Oh! certainly,"said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity;"we will ask you no questions.""Thank you,"said Lydia,"for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.	737.6262533855229
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information.	310.34774340173226
It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.	1162.1757013092415
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.	866.0070217856739
Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.	1132.3125304052896
She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.	715.7756994218583
"You may readily comprehend,"she added,"what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.	834.0940045914614
Pray write instantly, and let me understand it - - unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.""Not that I _shall_ though,"she added to herself, as she finished the letter;"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it; - - till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.	667.234875965872
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could.	363.3639686966344
She was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.	606.7830504408975
"Gracechurch - street, Sept.	1313.4446903109147
"MY DEAR NIECE,"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what I have to tell you.	995.7826264443715
I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.	383.324263801988
Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know, that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_ side.	995.1089005382117
If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence.	596.6490056394342
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am - - and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed him to act as he has done.	385.0431660926071
But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.	795.7142266533357
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.	602.8398500956971
It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _your's_ seems to have been.	577.515087133857
He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.	467.4622146498668
From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them.	984.1787406037879
The motive professed, was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character, to love or confide in him.	813.0568534042977
He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	792.4635461989069
He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on by himself.	1504.3718718635553
There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs.	933.5026494196568
Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what.	784.2329845322629
She then took a large house in Edward - street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.	929.3929120702073
This Mrs.	150.2738461386272
Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.	730.8331733638177
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted.	333.46185930810964
She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.	1108.4751726511613
They were in - - - - street.	148.8067412109569
He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.	1083.0434762630575
His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	858.7167059848399
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.	252.11904478617842
She cared for none of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of leaving Wickham.	475.95697418724035
She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.	500.19682206951535
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill - consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.	990.551873057274
He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	620.9456851933055
Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.	268.70944256624983
But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.	1062.1839460470505
Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.	1063.6072919546637
They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.	768.3201916502396
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	384.47533511684736
Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch - street the evening before I came home.	682.0560437195719
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him, till after the departure of the former.	823.7982560134112
He did not leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.	608.3684311913479
On Saturday he came again.	393.6417915758353
Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.	1096.130384069375
They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too.	820.7084169078637
It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.	437.0516647931878
But our visitor was very obstinate.	519.2522701840636
I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all.	1059.6277003565103
He has been accused of many faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.	625.5345106771622
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.	438.6242027900118
They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.	649.7679820947496
But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most.	1606.8893758514253
You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people.	904.1954861599041
His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased.	1938.8164903317586
It was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.	720.5366228780085
Perhaps there was some truth in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve, can be answerable for the event.	1549.613214381042
But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair.	1311.9215294558423
I believe I have now told you every thing.	226.37281061571534
Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house.	301.46808285844656
_He_ was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no fresh pain.	738.8610030629002
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.	414.63274459610113
If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.	705.0578399919943
I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.	697.2577593100174
Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.	717.9086730138897
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him.	1387.0250784292
But slyness seems the fashion.	609.875055026301
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park.	309.5066740567823
A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.	1600.9392677237838
But I must write no more.	216.86562927492488
The children have been wanting me this half hour.	464.4335187972418
Your's, very sincerely,"M.	1807.3994054946265
GARDINER."The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share.	672.898105335634
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	1058.9415337709002
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.	439.72651859651785
Her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.	459.0435075022529
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.	634.4913653478894
Brother - in - law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.	537.0058680777144
She was ashamed to think how much.	217.39673925439587
It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return.	875.8215465683359
They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing to him.	861.4031502774955
Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.	1425.5592962097073
For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.	255.53875571786457
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.	434.8659647016213
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again.	183.50652099484566
It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.	216.63682424768902
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.	836.6349767504023
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"said he, as he joined her.	825.3389592526227
"You certainly do,"she replied with a smile;"but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.""I should be sorry indeed, if it were.	387.16377703100665
_We_ were always good friends; and now we are better.""True.	385.7301219767177
Are the others coming out?""I do not know.	222.68067056810477
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton.	208.32290352970097
And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley."She replied in the affirmative.	800.8689722759808
And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?	865.1511827683325
But of course she did not mention my name to you.""Yes, she did.""And what did she say?""That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had - - not turned out well.	321.0699145933552
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.""Certainly,"he replied, biting his lips.	1440.7640679722738
We passed each other several times.	697.7024755001526
I wonder what he can be doing there.""Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,"said Elizabeth.	405.6388783126288
"It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.""Undoubtedly.	373.3798804056319
Did you see him while you were at Lambton?	427.11290642271547
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.""Yes; he introduced us to his sister.""And do you like her?""Very much.""I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two.	287.71090573924545
When I last saw her, she was not very promising.	507.11218980145367
A most delightful place! - - Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect.""How should you have liked making sermons?""Exceedingly well.	533.6799262114813
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?""I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.""You have.	776.4863123091774
Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the first, you may remember.""I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon - making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly.""You did! and it was not wholly without foundation.	631.4022660582698
In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind."She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.	792.2621216812516
Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.	498.13177649968105
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs.	377.6383345838797
"Oh! my dear Lydia,"she cried,"when shall we meet again?""Oh, lord! I don't know.	843.0908584626615
But you know married women have never much time for writing.	390.8876849799073
They will have nothing else to do."Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.	301.69657002364585
He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.	1774.6665940838109
"He is as fine a fellow,"said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house,"as ever I saw.	438.5309913499237
He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.	1059.153755243264
I am prodigiously proud of him.	293.87971074189136
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son - in - law."The loss of her daughter made Mrs.	603.5778879445054
Bennet very dull for several days.	527.4770728389987
One seems so forlorn without them.""This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,"said Elizabeth.	834.5683095170026
"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.""It is no such thing.	283.2156800308233
Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.	446.5521390186818
If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.	923.0903244019751
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.	590.4074286582552
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet was quite in the fidgets.	252.02163285766844
She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	1137.952147802945
"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,"(for Mrs.	1076.7334251817274
Not that I care about it, though.	581.9062987147474
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again.	600.7077678851522
But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.	1012.4016452830491
And who knows what _may_ happen?	1131.4985374883668
But that is nothing to us.	144.85766212503333
And so, is it quite certain he is coming?""You may depend on it,"replied the other,"for Mrs.	553.4209969783802
Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.	408.5165956166538
He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.	1281.5615386147492
She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed."Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour.	993.2063889447988
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,"I saw you look at me to - day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed.	657.7816451457952
But don't imagine it was from any silly cause.	572.5801820668363
I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at.	536.0753659857321
I do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.	634.3418473917781
I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.	441.51371903159315
Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.	411.0423884307243
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.	761.3390353963002
"Yet it is hard,"she sometimes thought,"that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself."In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.	930.729909723554
"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,"said Mrs.	586.0075447495091
Bennet,"you will wait on him of course.""No, no.	440.0949175113842
But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.	656.7204733315541
"'Tis an etiquette I despise,"said he.	852.4876433933821
"If he wants our society, let him seek it.	786.7250543799441
I will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again.""Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.	720.1998650254449
But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined.	1717.5152553072626
We must have Mrs.	194.50394239653855
Long and the Gouldings soon.	339.5556363537861
That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him."Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_ did.	649.741522281018
As the day of his arrival drew near,"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,"said Jane to her sister.	445.2726838868165
My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she says.	529.1671438582132
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!""I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,"replied Elizabeth;"but it is wholly out of my power.	430.9947017903016
You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much."Mr. Bingley arrived.	487.85468387584126
Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	939.053635197602
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing - room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	828.4644259165631
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.	545.550593495431
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window - - she looked, - - she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.	573.2808103344032
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,"said Kitty;"who can it be?""Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.""La!"replied Kitty,"it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.	491.15105198850205
Mr. what's his name.	137.97940957764476
Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him."Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.	327.53146621197186
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.	636.6787180102065
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.	291.5946121668925
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.	402.98063157399224
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.	388.3926090464836
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley.	954.2946648651913
Her astonishment at his coming - - at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.	811.6128952557058
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.	1120.6364069876445
But she would not be secure.	169.34380404282518
"Let me first see how he behaves,"said she;"it will then be early enough for expectation."She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	863.1033722482638
Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.	1099.9333777056452
On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.	896.7560742521324
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.	626.0078501442146
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.	338.0275035470899
But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	246.47589028321062
He was received by Mrs.	183.42462604588056
Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.	924.9649235891346
Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs.	352.8558232985126
Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	946.8040735171546
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.	196.9137993933186
More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	1352.4269851692552
"Could I expect it to be otherwise!"said she.	177.66921781151603
"Yet why did he come?"She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.	274.9539000514295
"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,"said Mrs.	740.0068371653417
Bennet.	69.40071254368596
He readily agreed to it.	231.29583021663524
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.	251.10563279548518
People _did_ say, you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.	1268.4860627532908
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.	1021.1893348154535
Miss Lucas is married and settled.	261.3697573733004
And one of my own daughters.	223.4750293541637
It was in the Times and the Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.	318.6297068390639
Did you see it?"Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.	405.5974271690414
How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.	794.4376678611796
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"continued her mother,"but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.	655.1285978434947
They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long.	1387.9664600008211
His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the - - - - shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.	350.74981446783084
Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.	638.8855747234187
It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.	962.8994916491899
A few weeks, he believed.	1219.4129096793556
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,"said her mother,"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr. Bennet's manor.	918.3236738011426
At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion.	717.4321408388785
"The first wish of my heart,"said she to herself,"is never more to be in company with either of them.	354.1985059467692
Their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!"Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re - kindled the admiration of her former lover.	932.2219529697878
He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.	773.4637640572751
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.	384.46846935603054
But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.	502.9357792867859
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs.	670.7257547757916
I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement."Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business.	633.6076999455858
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a - year.	933.8344275662134
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more.	773.3697734905486
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,"said she,"did he come at all?"She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	666.3821660114044
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?	643.3981138025586
If he fears me, why come hither?	1911.0186349033909
If he no longer cares for me, why silent?	1509.5811318208227
Teazing, teazing, man! I will think no more about him."Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.	1059.3875797489422
"Now,"said she,"that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.	974.8586754327733
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.	570.1570118295982
It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.""Yes, very indifferent indeed,"said Elizabeth, laughingly.	1273.5308298813616
Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.	1462.6094958088217
When they repaired to the dining - room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.	1008.0298425329858
On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.	827.7747993278814
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.	1853.7764370856316
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half - laughing alarm.	767.9233031086252
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.	836.3024995584055
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour.	348.8674845960121
Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them.	407.5665433257179
He was on one side of her mother.	172.24359345345687
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.	682.0672972990611
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did.	738.3337354746412
Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.	731.740840398712
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.	671.998569712575
Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing - room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil.	1338.7659246825997
She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.	447.0026877322886
"If he does not come to me, _then_,"said she,"I shall give him up for ever."The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair.	879.5837603284492
And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined.	1123.3731317800045
We want none of them; do we?"Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	299.4898344605906
Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	882.5563635915842
Annesley is with her.	212.79541577133594
When the tea - things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.	1055.3351195300518
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.	648.6718340914131
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	567.1647981140477
"Well girls,"said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,"What say you to the day?	634.330181964768
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.	298.28633111614516
The venison was roasted to a turn - - and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch.	1061.3177033041836
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.	692.3753655196846
And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty.	1018.6022023324203
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.	463.6511032724283
And what do you think she said besides?	346.19184464506094
'Ah! Mrs.	290.7569832655266
I do think Mrs.	138.91313958524555
Long is as good a creature as ever lived - - and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."Mrs.	485.98138260448275
"It has been a very agreeable day,"said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.	321.81191772569883
"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.	742.6963208773914
I hope we may often meet again."Elizabeth smiled.	293.30247428621584
"Lizzy, you must not do so.	353.4756498667441
You must not suspect me.	312.63011420173933
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.	495.2570745772087
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man.""You are very cruel,"said her sister,"you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.""How hard it is in some cases to be believed!""And how impossible in others!""But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?""That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.	454.27188072329216
We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.	1061.8995439253351
His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time.	563.2435537081213
He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.	634.4196179225252
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	1038.1770271355008
"Next time you call,"said she,"I hope we shall be more lucky."He should be particularly happy at any time, & c.	627.2978841292472
He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed.	606.223548861124
In ran Mrs.	291.85296546496545
Make haste, make haste.	2652.7714086694345
Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair.""We will be down as soon as we can,"said Jane;"but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.""Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it?	556.656571830777
After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.	1058.5775925410105
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs.	687.0082060332447
Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them.	509.52558961267545
Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said,"What is the matter mamma?	553.8076821553296
What do you keep winking at me for?	553.8247376391026
What am I to do?""Nothing child, nothing.	430.40508074374424
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.	625.3359474414615
In a few minutes, Mrs.	796.2100543790841
Bennet half opened the door and called out,"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."Elizabeth was forced to go.	613.0306244099185
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;"said her mother as soon as she was in the hall.	226.6981795864581
"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room."Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing - room.	532.9048282698103
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.	443.0719103838687
Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.	388.2877766620372
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.	644.8903623822464
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	588.2454509441654
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time.	710.2079842291206
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.	400.5881897187556
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.	432.32614351987297
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs.	188.64217649687484
Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.	374.9740215901734
Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	635.0956790414397
But on returning to the drawing - room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her.	827.3054157324691
On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all.	1038.141760493411
_Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she thought was still worse.	939.1637647984194
Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.	911.014153941695
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.	1203.0108225297674
I do not deserve it.	144.91942595923888
Oh! why is not every body as happy?"Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.	1028.410147346452
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.	218.60372564093564
"I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself.	320.0216569244606
He is gone to my father already.	258.6214258789182
Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.	686.2341560413211
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.	1036.8682592519074
"And this,"said she,"is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.	706.895086057875
"Where is your sister?"said he hastily, as he opened the door.	464.6154893804713
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.	396.88965417863784
They shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super - excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.	783.8582587776243
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.	531.0043727716239
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said,"Jane, I congratulate you.	920.3375374731172
You will be a very happy woman."Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.	471.734941914333
"You are a good girl;"he replied,"and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.	359.6160619372044
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together.	226.7840971951045
Your tempers are by no means unlike.	960.3667916929127
Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in _me_.""Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,"cried his wife,"what are you talking of?	965.9954434010598
Why, he has four or five thousand a - year, and very likely more."Then addressing her daughter,"Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	1249.851497913785
I knew how it would be.	156.19371671251145
I always said it must be so, at last.	371.56583649752866
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together.	603.6043485089328
Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.	694.7354736133506
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child.	584.8992399449746
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.	361.00327589554064
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	398.86682788119265
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept.	1349.4798610434234
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	394.3237643602393
In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.	650.8277261197151
"He has made me so happy,"said she, one evening,"by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible.""I suspected as much,"replied Elizabeth.	480.50008281901574
"But how did he account for it?""It must have been his sister's doing.	218.94656896243185
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.	633.0019479659752
But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other.""That is the most unforgiving speech,"said Elizabeth,"that I ever heard you utter.	732.3521288225373
Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.""Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!""He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty."This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.	653.3830186631069
Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.	712.4467568632255
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"cried Jane.	388.7474931697545
"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but such another man for you!""If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.	702.5079441933486
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness.	950.7081545989857
No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time."The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.	882.9453481305428
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.	224.79854951769462
Philips, and _she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.	1128.4823764951443
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	1006.3055366964962
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining - room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.	691.3924553351105
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.	557.9520438336822
As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.	1202.2538178029781
They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered.	1240.0941099958377
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.	396.8398534940337
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.	753.0642007397207
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.	1038.4016066876484
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.	621.8665488499042
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.	853.1564260146961
That lady I suppose is your mother."Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	301.44303835956686
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.""Yes, madam,"said Mrs.	479.3754775757859
Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.	496.65507486961263
"She is my youngest girl but one.	244.56342878524683
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.""This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west."Mrs.	528.4293882097543
Collins well.""Yes, very well.	340.9510466029739
I saw them the night before last."Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.	403.59706202402435
But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	980.8844961782853
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.	1284.1524596738748
As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining - parlour and drawing - room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.	1797.3562873330563
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?"said she, as she looked in her face.	326.8340506865393
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner: - -"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.	817.0686513557525
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come."Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	763.8660424870689
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.	1644.7689985915827
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.""Miss Bennet,"replied her ladyship, in an angry tone,"you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.	482.5910553437948
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.	891.9200835371125
I was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that _you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy.	1082.5429590077847
Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.""If you believed it impossible to be true,"said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain,"I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.	641.2824399809405
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?	1842.8082473262596
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?""I never heard that it was.""And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?""I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.	461.8326146541854
_You_ may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer.""This is not to be borne.	559.1399859944487
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.	374.28821025576616
But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.	886.697467198999
You may have drawn him in.""If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.""Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?	326.60586879181074
I have not been accustomed to such language as this.	336.20403956982005
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.""But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.""Let me be rightly understood.	598.3170861970974
This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.	1174.1789545183267
No, never.	1033.0849932706935
Mr. Darcy is engaged to _my daughter_.	459.77002088779886
From their infancy, they have been intended for each other.	972.7200370047251
It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of her's.	325.7054514028727
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?	1039.7408753998927
Have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?""Yes, and I had heard it before.	568.870711192117
But what is that to me?	153.43590417983646
You both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage.	523.9672778002521
Its completion depended on others.	1903.5878771544938
If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?	669.7285503355963
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?""Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.	3307.2427483038277
Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	1035.8919291230586
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.""These are heavy misfortunes,"replied Elizabeth.	457.4264659915414
"But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.""Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?	678.7008460139577
"Let us sit down.	364.7169047071396
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it.	710.6859425180933
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	401.197597452105
Hear me in silence.	462.3532861630708
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.	402.7329601045872
They are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.	2204.157613310361
Their fortune on both sides is splendid.	365.57047076943763
Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be.	434.9937903384719
If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up.""In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.	675.125277299173
He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal.""True.	276.1672456351108
You _are_ a gentleman's daughter.	423.696820701124
But who was your mother?	257.1920871856673
Who are your uncles and aunts?	1103.6869882014316
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?""I will make no promise of the kind.""Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.	332.8737482498801
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman.	327.41953781584795
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede.	556.4218697285727
I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance I require.""And I certainly _never_ shall give it.	500.09449060642316
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.	557.3421086242928
Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished - for promise, make _their_ marriage at all more probable?	645.6874865919067
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged.	1056.0761885865104
You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.	894.3517794461011
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine.	750.7486207126148
I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.""Not so hasty, if you please.	710.6045514770727
I have by no means done.	200.3536857199094
To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.	587.0998998104947
I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched - up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	508.60919627081745
And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?	401.6940134829209
Heaven and earth! - - of what are you thinking?	368.14609960082333
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?""You can _now_ have nothing farther to say,"she resentfully answered.	555.0599448149654
"You have insulted me, in every possible method.	954.9459489876791
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back.	1013.7123476857356
Her ladyship was highly incensed.	706.6681012474475
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?""Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.	807.8879263763574
You know my sentiments.""You are then resolved to have him?""I have said no such thing.	201.91516379195718
I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.""It is well.	1047.8051894649186
You refuse, then, to oblige me.	863.9564800808065
You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	1623.3040913596865
And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern - - and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.""And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.	581.5168034860278
I shall now know how to act.	240.20267258293413
Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.	1392.8025383094196
I came to try you.	148.6688450599084
I hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point."In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.	817.6171719740288
I send no compliments to your mother.	255.02264343777327
You deserve no such attention.	346.24377994919024
I am most seriously displeased."Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.	571.921916951342
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	343.3864853376431
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing - room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	314.7891832519549
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.	1091.405590413377
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	386.916678408065
The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.	1075.807778333399
Lady Catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.	841.83300813999
It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea.	676.7960586776701
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.	319.0695232825114
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.	1032.6034134394358
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.	597.1251374992258
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.	766.3174579815952
With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	1449.940480010288
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him.	690.6965458199248
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days,"she added,"I shall know how to understand it.	1120.5187796245223
I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.	831.6108872311473
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all."* * * * * The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs.	1053.9246723726628
Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	262.2421015400737
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	724.4026009785008
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.	609.4672736669122
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	654.1277615661833
He then said,"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.	508.20495581671724
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.	1075.1419546629725
I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony.	520.0060377195157
Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued,"You look conscious.	740.7073601857327
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.	1049.148147834327
This letter is from Mr. Collins.""From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?""Something very much to the purpose of course.	230.97385552799466
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good - natured, gossiping Lucases.	1082.2806171150405
"Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs.	209.56847977639706
Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority.	646.8829832900533
Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.""Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?""This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire, - - splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.	1722.2645785786508
Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.""Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?	1712.9385392956133
But now it comes out.""My motive for cautioning you, is as follows.	369.69946996094455
We have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.""_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you.	1113.8488464747713
Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related?	1691.7547629575872
Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life! It is admirable!"Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.	824.9998723673267
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.	293.60584311910856
Pray read on.""After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.	734.0742874822224
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.""Mr. Collins moreover adds,""I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known.	802.5462193688325
I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.	1392.8290516168265
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.""_That_ is his notion of christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive - branch.	526.5939627759616
But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.	796.7242173272938
You are not going to be _Missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.	1027.2377544500564
For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?""Oh!"cried Elizabeth,"I am excessively diverted.	872.8782086500084
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration.	1109.2173748906753
Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law.	831.7821648119818
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?	1984.484475187536
Did she call to refuse her consent?"To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it.	462.2276741017925
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.	249.7432313445943
It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.	530.1952827789646
Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.	958.6233216231257
The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs.	686.449069400339
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out.	1103.0533778791487
It was agreed to.	135.28223627298865
Mrs.	67.95933422618745
Bennet was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together.	496.1148093681045
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.	1067.2452990570023
They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy, were to entertain each other.	2996.082927598936
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.	1043.2824463858155
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said,"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's.	865.4834941020125
I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.	622.0987610190325
I did not think Mrs.	136.71739756643484
Gardiner was so little to be trusted.""You must not blame my aunt.	209.867739295028
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.	537.6211608316797
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.	711.2257353245036
But your _family_ owe me nothing.	287.9640459466959
Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of _you_."Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	431.66728744884045
After a short pause, her companion added,"You are too generous to trifle with me.	1061.8174020532
If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.	895.208128332416
_My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	1112.7786878113318
The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.	359.45323057417426
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart - felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.	1251.76795385805
They walked on, without knowing in what direction.	860.6387758860202
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.	886.7054288854687
But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	2146.3100531704895
"It taught me to hope,"said he,"as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.	374.9884628055309
It was unpardonable.	275.25713086839204
I cannot think of it without abhorrence.""We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening,"said Elizabeth.	420.6877444161118
The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.	1411.3303413879366
Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget:'had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner.'Those were your words.	685.5493156446686
You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; - - though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.""I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.	668.6191427013756
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.""I can easily believe it.	213.99231605073115
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me.""Oh! do not repeat what I then said.	456.8959921085121
These recollections will not do at all.	368.2687602824564
I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."Darcy mentioned his letter.	353.6408398798658
"Did it,"said he,"did it _soon_ make you think better of me?	659.8725144210831
I hope you have destroyed the letter.	249.7224227548808
There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again.	754.0681117269678
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.""The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.""When I wrote that letter,"replied Darcy,"I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.""The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.	910.2573321691763
The adieu is charity itself.	1105.8610054764604
But think no more of the letter.	156.7654905088598
The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	1018.4236874821177
You must learn some of my philosophy.	160.01396922880767
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.""I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	314.1058851395906
_Your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance.	1445.377371810319
But with _me_, it is not so.	399.5907240688592
Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	2460.559104603075
I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	870.0856300546924
I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.	457.8353042428914
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.	855.1724163550253
By you, I was properly humbled.	1171.5669748326068
I came to you without a doubt of my reception.	194.5581056103481
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.""Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?""Indeed I had.	395.46382283623586
What will you think of my vanity?	310.07251210422606
I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.""My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.	507.041732830212
I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.	895.0499529188567
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?""Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.""I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at Pemberley.	494.82999749952353
You blamed me for coming?""No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.""Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.	407.48319604174236
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.""My object _then_,"replied Darcy,"was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.	700.2954828723294
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.	698.2719141747863
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.	757.349022547052
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.	1304.5586806211697
"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!"was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.	235.6829204162606
"I must ask whether you were surprised?"said Elizabeth.	224.30640442980732
"Not at all.	130.91605094790634
When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.""That is to say, you had given your permission.	491.2972069850072
I guessed as much."And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.	445.53433374106663
"On the evening before my going to London,"said he"I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.	458.87840710124095
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent.	506.03222324594833
He had never had the slightest suspicion.	336.6302038711072
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.	604.9287134012689
"Did you speak from your own observation,"said she,"when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?""From the former.	565.6712410447626
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.	811.0683824546167
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.	962.1056498358586
I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.	974.0399990402282
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.	612.0913114703172
He was angry.	172.33476523744727
But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.	895.5604945858095
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin.	479.4295582484939
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house.	589.0893233982874
In the hall they parted.	308.7806055006273
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?"was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table.	433.70809863148855
She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge.	723.7040654582171
She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	960.611380061472
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.	1605.4087668311342
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	1519.0519898914763
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy, than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her.	1160.7403627807455
At night she opened her heart to Jane.	309.15781324113345
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	1054.8598065001452
"You are joking, Lizzy.	1076.4296858387095
This cannot be! - - engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me.	563.116743046732
I know it to be impossible.""This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.	337.92626932424804
Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.	1518.3093754177316
He still loves me, and we are engaged."Jane looked at her doubtingly.	684.133045590719
"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be.	435.67207530559415
I know how much you dislike him.""You know nothing of the matter.	187.31266096794803
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.	264.75571623464117
But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.	491.6560583387809
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself."Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.	340.0174490254174
"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,"cried Jane.	484.76259860384937
"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would - - I do congratulate you - - but are you certain?	530.7613447156566
forgive the question - - are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?""There can be no doubt of that.	196.51569952592783
But are you pleased, Jane?	877.6322113766106
Shall you like to have such a brother?""Very, very much.	436.6091435780809
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight.	543.3342067749691
But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.	544.0900606995814
And do you really love him quite well enough?	475.60212994194234
Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than marry without affection.	919.7417812206888
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?""Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all.""What do you mean?""Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley.	543.7327779531984
I want to talk very seriously.	262.18637764766186
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.	598.5053763786802
Will you tell me how long you have loved him?""It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.	509.04886656152314
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.	553.9303631872993
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish.	740.3500707117254
"Now I am quite happy,"said she,"for you will be as happy as myself.	444.8579735173903
I always had a value for him.	161.39719268683226
Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.	558.4008725750867
But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.	1068.5504049485592
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it, to another, not to you."Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.	313.8728041041612
But now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage.	504.40734988793923
All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.	671.5222902976284
* * * * *"Good gracious!"cried Mrs.	656.6657677258326
I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.	857.1768375938929
What shall we do with him?	334.8508400566346
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way."Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.	485.0640406789374
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud,"Mr. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day?""I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,"said Mrs.	871.8336073455339
Bennet,"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.	953.39524597487
Wont it, Kitty?"Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.	883.0914670829477
As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs.	877.0875964268868
Bennet followed her, saying,"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.	965.6995032359548
But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then.	444.09949521252696
So, do not put yourself to inconvenience."During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.	422.31619360885117
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's.	207.29259223017132
She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.	476.28753686328923
But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.	437.38339735147935
* * * * * In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme.	756.8580289298508
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	1168.585689967898
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper,"Go to your father, he wants you in the library."She was gone directly.	665.2331706659908
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.	782.6291070334645
"Lizzy,"said he,"what are you doing?	661.2155087271393
Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?	917.0050051950878
Have not you always hated him?"How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.	654.5004219888345
He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.	821.1857209859028
But will they make you happy?""Have you any other objection,"said Elizabeth,"than your belief of my indifference?""None at all.	498.47324745610695
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.""I do, I do like him,"she replied, with tears in her eyes,"I love him.	571.9651366844887
Indeed he has no improper pride.	652.8640472714677
He is perfectly amiable.	280.316339916109
You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.""Lizzy,"said her father,"I have given him my consent.	397.91650217970556
He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.	947.3589567448728
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him.	460.7212315734782
But let me advise you to think better of it.	231.47491989246208
I know your disposition, Lizzy.	701.2662955027605
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery.	677.4143156225192
My child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life.	828.6079933342037
You know not what you are about."Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.	896.3273559895512
"Well, my dear,"said he, when she ceased speaking,"I have no more to say.	690.5079457836238
If this be the case, he deserves you.	600.8711928353946
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy."To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.	552.4393070423679
He heard her with astonishment.	218.777575114499
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the better.	1087.6037007973002
It will save me a world of trouble and economy.	470.36866745420383
Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way.	834.8127092275897
I shall offer to pay him to - morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go - - saying, as she quitted the room,"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.	638.2268688852159
Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.	848.9833770157195
Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs.	753.1685381639625
Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.	1068.951070486187
Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them.	481.7306457065632
She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.	2088.752070913658
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true?	519.4571562920704
Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin - money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it - - nothing at all.	688.9184367864927
I am so pleased - - so happy.	188.074575604632
Such a charming man! - - so handsome! so tall! - - Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	645.8155578830019
I hope he will overlook it.	246.20917194240744
Dear, dear Lizzy.	1782.9041086835537
But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.	435.17450306525285
"My dearest child,"she cried,"I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more!'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence.	1040.8694919645397
You must and shall be married by a special licence.	490.68444925973887
But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to - morrow."This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'consent, there was still something to be wished for.	601.5929681615114
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs.	342.4974109287921
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.	717.8140760574356
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.	262.78797530061536
"I admire all my three sons - in - law highly,"said he.	483.66827747669345
"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well as Jane's."Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.	507.11287099882776
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?""I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation.	847.9654364998613
It is too long ago.	323.80572546660096
I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun.""My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners - - my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.	528.0950549965002
I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.	1441.2738006902164
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you.	795.656610094609
There - - I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.	638.3992169439541
To be sure, you knew no actual good of me - - but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love.""Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?""Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her?	501.6972716792906
But make a virtue of it by all means.	220.1712380563387
My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.	501.9329085940219
What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?	946.4650346519878
Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?""Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.""But I was embarrassed.""And so was I.""You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.""A man who had felt less, might.""How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.	456.7736014120115
I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.	594.7760264462343
_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject?	1388.5526260321544
This will never do.""You need not distress yourself.	278.575303386444
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.	406.77801065183365
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's.	182.06929919460111
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.""Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.	585.8925345855608
But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?	624.7552491645341
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?	312.8476434516365
or had you intended any more serious consequence?""My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me.	656.05314566296
But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.""And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	621.6640364975498
But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over - rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.	761.0192634870657
Gardiner's long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write.	1179.272810795153
But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err.	1209.890191666714
You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.	515.3975878394356
I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.	393.767566149267
How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful.	327.7098781756782
We will go round the Park every day.	440.7589034739107
I am the happiest creature in the world.	199.69361080976697
Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice.	572.7690754147807
I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.	696.5994298581323
Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can spare from me.	387.626118529115
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.	303.41943968146785
Your's, & c."Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last.	511.98160135442475
"DEAR SIR,"I must trouble you once more for congratulations.	459.70626647491423
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.	128.8579225643525
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.	655.7988073665607
He has more to give.	173.70555917595186
Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.	668.7676371101312
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.	375.03471137361817
Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge.	1092.5938898628826
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.	1016.1718293514614
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.	717.7490241925263
He bore it however with admirable calmness.	757.2251147902408
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure.	985.2363973488536
Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs.	777.0954118005932
Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.	1428.225734370021
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant.	489.1823942249389
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs.	727.5287065360592
Darcy may be guessed.	320.2646563382479
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well - informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.	681.7417616892791
He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.	668.7875156671635
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	823.1572271442807
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.	736.119330020512
In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.	598.85716118137
She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.	2221.0503409141584
Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone.	396.24742786023654
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters'beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.	738.5529262758733
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.	368.03023173758794
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	1019.280238784208
The letter was to this effect:"MY DEAR LIZZY,"I wish you joy.	580.1887980098825
It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.	437.94722344943625
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.	591.6448362620825
Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.	771.1485543433888
"Yours, & c."As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	526.121122165607
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them.	1208.570042580276
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills.	1137.0353156926253
Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme.	1103.9183190797912
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.	877.1416009565831
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.	1362.44310797945
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.	624.3408884179246
They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended.	634.0931931020672
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother.	856.4507427487673
He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.	1133.1129110220802
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.	509.1486456050918
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.	890.5187825114261
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.	664.4978389278174
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	968.4476326863352
