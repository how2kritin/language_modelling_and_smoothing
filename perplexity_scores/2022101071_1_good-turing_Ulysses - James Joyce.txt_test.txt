A little trouble about those white corpuscles.	1107.591286180123
— Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.	485.57178674911967
— How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?	601.0317796150233
You saved men from drowning.	2909.7876881469456
The scrotumtightening sea.	781.7629930543873
There is something sinister in you....	8821.791349211922
God knows what poxy bowsy left them off.	675.2246450205365
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.	1349.7625527159441
Buck Mulligan answered.	3387.1510766589176
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom.	1662.452936281386
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it ’ s injected the wrong way.	622.3132691006934
Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down.	251.1819549494059
A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl.	628.8293439283535
A servant too.	2429.290037593374
Janey Mack, I ’ m choked! He howled, without looking up from the fire: — Kinch! — It ’ s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.	435.43638397322275
he said.	856.4235297911396
— The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.	920.2972639284028
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman ’ s unclean loins, of man ’ s flesh made not in God ’ s likeness, the serpent ’ s prey.	440.68473058480566
— Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I ’ m ashamed I don ’ t speak the language myself.	565.0411602254784
What did you say that for?	247.98408930267038
His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.	944.1773163008086
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.	939.165928809939
Brief exposure.	2510.44194490432
He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.	609.7792170966105
— Seymour ’ s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock.	757.3409611994349
— Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.	626.4815785497858
— The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.	1543.6763542003862
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.	352.7089169712105
— Go on then, Talbot.	961.7297115106245
My father gave me seeds to sow.	3697.8280602537193
Ask me, sir.	1173.146813731118
— Again, sir.	1000.4476587737099
Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir.	639.9549617513273
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail.	1144.637255945536
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.	580.7939745411385
Mr Deasy is calling you.	1622.2058910140036
— What is it now?	192.72300743310623
It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table.	891.7987229177679
Money is power.	915.6041729308597
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman ’ s mouth?	714.6866323616034
— I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.	968.2723544769653
He saw their speeds, backing king ’ s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.	595.0009594799699
He came to the table, pinning together his sheets.	1153.6012672282825
Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel.	732.3734231972975
Serum and virus.	191.70827541100243
Now I ’ m going to try publicity.	1679.5176161991315
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm.	1404.1919507733642
I am, a stride at a time.	640.6285039324533
They clasped and sundered, did the coupler ’ s will.	582.6161874915807
Yes, I must.	723.1163028210752
Lump of love.	490.45701367873903
It lowers.	753.6403372180151
Whusky! — Uncle Richie, really...	3757.09748642854
We have nothing in the house but backache pills.	2154.234046903742
_All ’ erta! _ He drones bars of Ferrando ’ s _aria di sortita_.	185.6389611703403
Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint.	1250.6570466117937
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man ’ s ashes.	692.743237354274
_Fermé_.	654.5133228778832
The sun is there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.	726.2993844915193
She serves me at his beck.	3219.567808604557
Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes.	573.5502359181619
Loveless, landless, wifeless.	87.53914807444008
He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.	536.00864620384
Before him the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand.	1295.7123172016743
Something he buried there, his grandmother.	546.5262126434925
After he woke me last night same dream or was it?	839.9604964991571
Open hallway.	6983.929762849599
In. Come.	9364.87705051248
Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.	3632.8308886820946
Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun ’ s flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands.	252.39270536063802
He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	698.0449875506201
Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.	1706.7585423680446
Welcome as the flowers in May.	572.7431007613569
My ashplant will float away.	5067.763566314879
I shall wait.	2169.5397570759396
Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh.	690.2938947323946
And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist.	4859.046229837187
The coals were reddening.	7687.965204069642
— Mkgnao! — O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.	287.9877394071459
— Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.	547.6025667778108
She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.	5115.524623387522
No. On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door.	1108.1732605694087
He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	644.5327239823475
Not there.	2248.2448218689565
Makes you feel young.	841.1406471342201
Getting on to sundown.	5107.610064183419
A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.	1926.6819816682023
On the wholesale orders perhaps.	4121.598794090106
The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.	733.6961721402477
For you, please?	246.42909171566774
She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right.	1690.0470775287374
Still an idea behind it.	1862.141499004837
Wonder if I ’ ll meet him today.	1234.5229453405002
Yes, yes.	1030.7066775461917
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.	1210.6750749575956
Here.	4163.460194123237
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.	893.1141824562509
Only five she was then.	1590.908137811628
O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.	661.7722881146349
The night Milly brought it into the parlour.	649.4920400587735
Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream.	476.340023777897
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow.	726.3199882539571
C.	3903.316026160732
— Here, she said.	596.6921361830111
Who ’ s he when he ’ s at home?	201.24240166366093
He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes.	2337.74514450917
Illustration.	654.5133228778832
An example?	589.007791975731
— Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it.	619.9776900119815
He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.	752.6538436221142
Byby.	13137.782459902772
Of course it might.	1978.9441333829084
Vain: very.	3884.6287912171274
On the _Erin ’ s King_ that day round the Kish.	434.623632482134
Useless: can ’ t move.	634.5826607951202
Virginia creepers.	2881.397826542465
Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows.	2310.2922807690097
Nobody.	648.4142163114785
Invent a story for some proverb.	1452.985713076528
<URL>.	2694.4121317158665
Her head dancing.	3855.9993942113565
I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing.	1250.8010991763492
A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up.	1494.2542726251477
Singing with his eyes shut.	2337.366784076173
In the dark.	1084.5273353898604
No - one.	1753.705768886597
Eyes front.	6026.265954403961

I see you ’ re...	3480.1310363480106
Having a wet.	679.9661576629201
Off to the country: Broadstone probably.	2032.088685660077
— Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh.	627.6488393736677
Like to see her again in that.	632.4646314245388
Rachel, is it?	332.754342030518
Every word is so deep, Leopold.	1579.312069628558
Ruins and tenements.	1560.4705618200394
A yellow flower with flattened petals.	605.855440142589
Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?	794.7051402200831

Perfectly right that is.	2246.3945952467266
Palestrina for example too.	870.4517504589244
Eunuch.	15787.963800563719

Where is this?	273.9353584728117
Aq. Dist.	1374.7951803511655
Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.	1225.52941841651
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	541.394269430807
How much are they?	387.9682269570847
To look younger.	3873.171981008635
Regular hotbed of it lately.	1285.1375576206199
College sports today I see.	2745.2384557141677
Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself.	1286.0236531062308
Nose whiteflattened against the pane.	645.3393471228808
He was alone.	1346.4863333026533
Great card he was.	1681.7761259675115
His name stinks all over Dublin.	2910.5960976749625
Mr Power asked.	2273.159303446849
Gasworks.	654.5133228778832
Got off lightly with illnesses compared.	696.8529343886388
Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish.	1642.120016807246
— It ’ s as uncertain as a child ’ s bottom, he said.	515.3990953370036
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.	911.2550357920006
He ’ s dead nuts on that.	691.7744852589362
— No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly.	562.0119764794185
What causes that?	84.89780011609926
The carriage wheeling by Farrell ’ s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.	6170.024715271009
And _Madame_.	6985.399708006647
Or the Moira, was it?	279.84874547804765
— About the boatman?	112.0976643312707
Mr Power asked.	2273.159303446849
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	525.3689818241534
Martin Cunningham ’ s large eyes.	1351.2920683919688
As if it wasn ’ t broken already.	1781.6867768605634
Wear the heart out of a stone, that.	689.0665904933385
— God grant he doesn ’ t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.	1004.0054157777172
Very encouraging.	11852.774016156907
Our Lady ’ s Hospice for the dying.	604.4785514810734
— What ’ s wrong now?	253.49958905009282
— Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know.	508.93393230875046
— Why?	178.2831959412683

One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.	835.6609360120462
The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad ’ s belly.	674.0341969702706
Mr Kernan said with reproof.	635.5447811017892
Secret eyes, secretsearching.	1256.8110548325274
Eh?	290.7036277742018
— Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan?	583.1238213778487
— Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	292.8409679332136
Whores in Turkish graveyards.	2330.905006984571

And you might put down M ’ Coy ’ s name too.	849.8182574085664
He was on the _Freeman_ once.	989.6003468461981
We have time.	1742.6399835050142
More interesting if they told you what they were.	1431.1989298965075

Parked in North Prince ’ s street His Majesty ’ s vermilion mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E.	896.950951249782
Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman and National Press_ and the _Freeman ’ s Journal and National Press_.	1256.7356360943104

This ad, you see.	1131.2069459444376
Then here the name.	1132.5053125678355

NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying: — Wait.	778.0761569728444
a voice asked from the castingbox.	390.43710791305796
Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with his finger to me.	899.5028991076041
How quickly he does that job.	1698.4310592955808
Pop in a minute to phone.	788.2224743785318
He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.	1042.6542708756258

_ — That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence... _ — O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan.	1003.7660300108051
No, twenty...	8975.952681156246

It was at the royal university dinner.	1433.8382446905862

That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose.	376.41986776289554

He looked towards the saloon door.	1957.8228016228504
And blind too, poor fellow.	1239.755579144938
Third time.	7815.862270699019
Does that to all.	914.870561275923
Wire in yet?	108.0977184395049
O! But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.	1838.7142178760946
Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice: — Fine goods in small parcels.	690.4163894892846
— Here ’ s fortune, Blazes said.	927.9351472697685
Clock whirred.	23806.90089024796
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door.	1033.731689675035
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.	1590.3691542019499
I was only vamping, man.	330.2932367071897
His gouty paws plumped chords.	15715.957346344518
What?	122.71942533465327
Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords: — _When love absorbs my ardent soul_...	2625.068141605347

He went.	1699.0418323315832
It certainly is.	2136.86806906154
It ’ s so characteristic.	1507.7208968490245
One plus two plus six is seven.	3534.4374051338086
Playing it slow, a girl, night I came home, the girl.	641.0837801445423

She held it to her own.	884.6797278996152
Skin tanned raw.	2118.10887084259
So distinct.	4868.79886056291

But hear.	2736.603530781992
Big ships ’ chandler ’ s business he did once.	797.1674251490923
George Lidwell, eyelid well expressive, fullbusted satin.	1194.1148515333896

For him then not for.	946.3659377552914
Card inside.	12946.006803084185
Fit as a fiddle only he has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about his person.	1214.5836987032274

Up the quay went Lionelleopold, naughty Henry with letter for Mady, with sweets of sin with frillies for Raoul with met him pike hoses went Poldy on.	1392.4102966412258
I was with him this morning at poor little Paddy Dignam ’ s...	1670.9329610377324

I ’ m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.	521.2529015709691
Look at this, says he.	686.2638212442257
Here, Terry, give us a pony.	512.8741247007803
And he started laughing.	2070.665708898824
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam.	1141.9123301093057
says I.	1078.6465721370337
The tear is bloody near your eye.	1884.2584980917939
— _...	8302.34190810159
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?	196.529566220818
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn ’ t and he couldn ’ t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he ’ d just take a cigar.	527.7957769623251
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him: — Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw! Arrah, bloody end to the paw he ’ d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.	467.4984574258031
And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn ’ t near roast him, it ’ s a queer story, the old one, Bloom ’ s wife and Mrs O ’ Dowd that kept the hotel.	503.15324698699663
From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance.	849.0577392991595
Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents.	3205.3131303650716
That monster audience simply rocked with delight.	3597.0138836879346
A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.	748.0064103027528
Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what ’ s waiting for me down Limehouse way.	628.8953773294492
Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap ’ s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators.	672.4856608452825
— Well, that ’ s a point, says Bloom, for the wife ’ s admirers.	320.3433629082504
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee ’ s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act.	586.0365736350977
True as you ’ re there.	1055.7345556820796

Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.	602.0037041316718

— Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf.	502.9435928877885
It was a knockout clean and clever.	623.046167792282
I hear he ’ s running a concert tour now up in the north.	693.619707401627
That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal ’ s chest.	544.2723611702681
J.	2953.906025021904
Look at his head.	1331.8314278776638
— That what ’ s I mean, says the citizen.	418.5285405844667
What?	122.71942533465327
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he ’ ll dissolve in tears on the bench.	654.4653947327088
And J.	1987.2118864263668
And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world.	676.5164146093745
— Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage.	1175.1992702088173
All wind and piss like a tanyard cat.	3293.4942723351355
— Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse.	619.5346819997193
And another one: _Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga_.	303.1400287570255
Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.	672.825477978072

There ’ s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo.	723.7727443777293
Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.	593.0078871288807
— That covers my case, says Joe.	1071.4497528716843
I was born here.	1127.2331283288838
— And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.	833.2951497875899

Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.	967.0456861337414
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.	827.8035132441158
— Who made those allegations?	226.0026904126601

A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom ’ s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás - Dugulás (Meadow of Murmuring Waters).	663.0808083390854
Gob, the devil wouldn ’ t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen ’ s royal theatre: — Where is he till I murder him?	522.6058123639529

Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.	901.1376994918172
— Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.	1612.8714537698938
— Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?	983.3861602763398
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning.	751.672125527963
The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.	488.44217570200084
He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.	931.5106841048931
It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer ’ s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.	706.8264721884551
The colours were done something lovely.	2503.6982580740028
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty ’ s skirt near the little pool by the rock.	1010.179692440238
A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle.	1035.8068913601182
She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks.	1049.5098429078423
Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it: — Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.	657.7276142483112
It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft.	602.1903495031459
The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him.	265.31134246914434
She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl ’ s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station.	756.1772131539236
Sister?	314.68059192676486
Cheap too.	6567.287181415752
And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice.	1307.9876792647408
And I ’ ll write to you.	603.8711503791208

Press the button and the bird will squeak.	2053.318538578547
Wish she hadn ’ t called me sir.	1545.5604820065355

Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly.	447.2855117680849
Fifteen she told me.	2004.8868574318099
Lord mayor had his eye on her too.	1122.6722011415202
Why that highclass whore in Jammet ’ s wore her veil only to her nose.	1892.8668269283128
Neat way she carries parcels too.	8349.001113546106

Bad policy however to fault the husband.	2329.1840643503974

No. Wait.	10104.134957892533
All quiet on Howth now.	2345.0372177257727

Ugly: no woman thinks she is.	2308.466653898005
Might be money.	2828.809360232724
Must come back.	2612.3557048934194

Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously?	1158.912059922471
No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away.	470.6029586325622
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird - in - the - Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her.	583.7624025120738
To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul ’ s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip.	414.6821234308077
From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.	378.21209900033097

_Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.	1322.285376445616
My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment.	770.3125437650866
