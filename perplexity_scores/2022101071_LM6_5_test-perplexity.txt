A little trouble about those white corpuscles.	579.7451884017213
— Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.	60.31291050737997
— How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?	154.38292867081864
You saved men from drowning.	55.12363870657514
The scrotumtightening sea.	354.11092854668004
There is something sinister in you....	90.22252251763226
God knows what poxy bowsy left them off.	662.2353441253231
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.	1475.519456973452
Buck Mulligan answered.	13.876052587205482
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom.	407.8803768954175
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it ’ s injected the wrong way.	439.0581026807837
Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down.	473.4482980696892
A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl.	243.6121232512508
A servant too.	170.53376312634003
Janey Mack, I ’ m choked! He howled, without looking up from the fire: — Kinch! — It ’ s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.	141.17113139019867
he said.	10.24588778153892
— The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.	256.5605373046511
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman ’ s unclean loins, of man ’ s flesh made not in God ’ s likeness, the serpent ’ s prey.	297.41948542859797
— Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I ’ m ashamed I don ’ t speak the language myself.	79.23482813992604
What did you say that for?	40.72919527075407
His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.	616.930611373752
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.	51.4397634771217
Brief exposure.	2276.950860598613
He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.	956.2355404522813
— Seymour ’ s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock.	134.7264228621777
— Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.	127.74260651713809
— The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.	23.653988456982322
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.	122.57626932023337
— Go on then, Talbot.	49.53294287359222
My father gave me seeds to sow.	402.92031669451694
Ask me, sir.	16.580119628079228
— Again, sir.	59.122675308492255
Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir.	75.31449667980539
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail.	701.9112627641881
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.	768.7779274626945
Mr Deasy is calling you.	161.05606395514778
— What is it now?	15.550102653702027
It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table.	347.945198993467
Money is power.	308.25792333847573
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman ’ s mouth?	145.46543450268476
— I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.	180.9644756049842
He saw their speeds, backing king ’ s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.	656.360519301345
He came to the table, pinning together his sheets.	245.46631599956095
Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel.	1025.1804825861313
Serum and virus.	1663.5664697405016
Now I ’ m going to try publicity.	70.97094491357358
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm.	1096.4427151073373
I am, a stride at a time.	59.856425187411844
They clasped and sundered, did the coupler ’ s will.	341.25761655268815
Yes, I must.	24.19888039508518
Lump of love.	289.3059632825853
It lowers.	352.3251762403358
Whusky! — Uncle Richie, really...	450.11449115072077
We have nothing in the house but backache pills.	267.61095816917947
_All ’ erta! _ He drones bars of Ferrando ’ s _aria di sortita_.	4027.259139229538
Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint.	123.7089372841496
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man ’ s ashes.	2637.0203919864216
_Fermé_.	468.2567525998586
The sun is there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.	237.46931708272007
She serves me at his beck.	267.8450213807521
Of lost leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes.	960.1342027102652
Loveless, landless, wifeless.	2212.9996860931387
He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.	189.41272930615276
Before him the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand.	215.51487977536183
Something he buried there, his grandmother.	173.38063213947848
After he woke me last night same dream or was it?	323.0704774764876
Open hallway.	333.04191849386353
In. Come.	67.42038676710175
Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.	1444.728847837645
Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun ’ s flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands.	190.39234588904318
He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth ’ s kiss.	142.61457289910595
Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.	181.81260056159255
Welcome as the flowers in May.	578.9824101862946
My ashplant will float away.	967.3786818733012
I shall wait.	94.73628844526084
Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh.	320.0205994577992
And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist.	691.235975536707
The coals were reddening.	999.6345954562629
— Mkgnao! — O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.	53.45990454839486
— Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.	283.6173670590365
She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.	1574.6738480460185
No. On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door.	346.8555965506781
He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	410.0703115952553
Not there.	38.66586616244556
Makes you feel young.	134.2511563531348
Getting on to sundown.	264.88220371828294
A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.	291.6776638694894
On the wholesale orders perhaps.	338.29014796371763
The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.	2807.450970888491
For you, please?	117.33815848793884
She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right.	342.90879013512176
Still an idea behind it.	57.93593447257532
Wonder if I ’ ll meet him today.	36.05905255196315
Yes, yes.	14.055224445091888
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.	1444.3427300046867
Here.	19.774642670857872
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.	1456.8882798877164
Only five she was then.	172.46505887280557
O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.	77.97940240095913
The night Milly brought it into the parlour.	163.5284723284898
Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream.	355.6275783824859
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow.	611.5300810497735
C.	14.422967377726438
— Here, she said.	18.19606839709915
Who ’ s he when he ’ s at home?	37.7407042309228
He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes.	442.4220605837332
Illustration.	468.2567525998586
An example?	86.38518865283046
— Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it.	89.57867063826333
He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.	93.04881593708292
Byby.	146.55561663767222
Of course it might.	41.73352328312713
Vain: very.	267.7471822055036
On the _Erin ’ s King_ that day round the Kish.	405.90329747250365
Useless: can ’ t move.	160.03968643376527
Virginia creepers.	2519.860349470574
Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows.	722.0474809437225
Nobody.	34.83935691677003
Invent a story for some proverb.	1242.7026463538557
<URL>.	24.6924490659658
Her head dancing.	178.97503368560405
I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing.	196.62326080598692
A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up.	271.4635935384498
Singing with his eyes shut.	67.22854122228414
In the dark.	21.01932112109489
No - one.	13.231919638003063
Eyes front.	234.7553413736194

I see you ’ re...	20.327876722882273
Having a wet.	174.73424912773265
Off to the country: Broadstone probably.	347.4867653390461
— Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh.	39.752874719909855
Like to see her again in that.	53.56187084304006
Rachel, is it?	121.40165964635892
Every word is so deep, Leopold.	316.91955298745575
Ruins and tenements.	1585.1008773923256
A yellow flower with flattened petals.	844.7365930552867

Aq. Dist.	1309.519114317384
Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.	2517.707743503143
— Yes, sir, the chemist said.	9.330955994169434
How much are they?	56.319326399667894
To look younger.	341.3263298780826
Regular hotbed of it lately.	911.1129248040614
College sports today I see.	528.222645737053
Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself.	461.5552459116164
Nose whiteflattened against the pane.	1014.0546024776686
He was alone.	52.456167457836145
Great card he was.	176.7468948400825
His name stinks all over Dublin.	234.2319843899422
Mr Power asked.	14.305751805946807
Gasworks.	468.2567525998586
Got off lightly with illnesses compared.	1757.6276110886292
Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish.	232.4755719321776
— It ’ s as uncertain as a child ’ s bottom, he said.	67.02382007142657
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.	122.79957853544774
He ’ s dead nuts on that.	18.079454043113078
— No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly.	24.548817403832523
What causes that?	248.77873571015402
The carriage wheeling by Farrell ’ s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.	1898.9845918416918
And _Madame_.	58.86386670209871
Or the Moira, was it?	61.181131825326304
— About the boatman?	160.47933906764638
Mr Power asked.	14.305751805946807
— Yes, Mr Bloom said.	7.737319950758759
Martin Cunningham ’ s large eyes.	22.814847426651802
As if it wasn ’ t broken already.	110.4825614695408
Wear the heart out of a stone, that.	123.47177537870883
— God grant he doesn ’ t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.	81.50105642790113
Very encouraging.	498.21368735455883
Our Lady ’ s Hospice for the dying.	148.649759421421
— What ’ s wrong now?	31.19950324299365
— Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know.	109.8091119316582
— Why?	18.219719893590444
Terrible! — First round Dunphy ’ s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	51.09099203886299

One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.	204.91193884133577
The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad ’ s belly.	575.8080206791623
Mr Kernan said with reproof.	103.03918087445396
Secret eyes, secretsearching.	1218.711513153357
Eh?	23.58146863325907
— Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan?	104.4832977477533
— Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely ’ s.	15.312832413760546
Whores in Turkish graveyards.	1360.24126862836

And you might put down M ’ Coy ’ s name too.	41.8578622297209
He was on the _Freeman_ once.	92.84540323448978
We have time.	47.04603167805244
More interesting if they told you what they were.	66.54151539444906

Parked in North Prince ’ s street His Majesty ’ s vermilion mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E.	438.87133302748816
Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman and National Press_ and the _Freeman ’ s Journal and National Press_.	1480.3341302543222

This ad, you see.	86.50578467502774
Then here the name.	56.98670753679696

NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying: — Wait.	2414.524648134019
a voice asked from the castingbox.	105.22941417910785
Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with his finger to me.	356.5114234740338
How quickly he does that job.	143.78938960178857
Pop in a minute to phone.	294.64957922378306
He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.	555.1682351043011

No, twenty...	48.4764775744423

It was at the royal university dinner.	79.20129643866929

That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose.	174.83755710879242

And blind too, poor fellow.	108.29315977555073
Third time.	31.45162894964827
Does that to all.	123.5686494979201
Wire in yet?	662.7308372901583
O! But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.	1168.0448381562305
Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice: — Fine goods in small parcels.	985.6306067508556
— Here ’ s fortune, Blazes said.	92.40940539921876
Clock whirred.	434.41503590281616
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door.	649.5124857579444
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.	761.7212420805984
I was only vamping, man.	138.01670667222876
His gouty paws plumped chords.	1342.585358664199
What?	14.626800461768257
Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords: — _When love absorbs my ardent soul_...	1311.709075019561
No trouble.	101.64519036225201
Clean here at least.	227.63585523644792

He can ’ t sing for tall hats.	134.64975158344467

He went.	20.24890044110502
It certainly is.	36.91927764884633
It ’ s so characteristic.	35.76570852663864
One plus two plus six is seven.	1362.0340194113642
Playing it slow, a girl, night I came home, the girl.	194.43322927248488

Under Tom Kernan ’ s ginhot words the accompanist wove music slow.	1704.428851197743
Bob Cowley wove.	309.23051605699925
She held it to her own.	75.33685865652343
Skin tanned raw.	1991.3026922305016
So distinct.	278.7591505353757

But hear.	70.0838226180744
Big ships ’ chandler ’ s business he did once.	531.7412023259444
George Lidwell, eyelid well expressive, fullbusted satin.	1138.5543733697853
Blank face.	501.2272452567125
They want it.	32.49905272379991
Say something.	38.01274485789355
Make her hear.	182.06417484103756
My lips closed.	323.02887626998404
For all things dying, for all things born.	208.0616551343645

For him then not for.	108.59248264917012
Card inside.	359.0732772186863
Fit as a fiddle only he has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about his person.	801.7788983448119
That was to say he had heard the name of.	44.522923500521365
Up the quay went Lionelleopold, naughty Henry with letter for Mady, with sweets of sin with frillies for Raoul with met him pike hoses went Poldy on.	414.39374423931343
I was with him this morning at poor little Paddy Dignam ’ s...	25.859475084273956

I ’ m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.	435.92746996179415
Look at this, says he.	23.947887117179484
Here, Terry, give us a pony.	155.93980342817628
And he started laughing.	179.1886691438707
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam.	54.36588002198358
says I.	14.93050077080704
The tear is bloody near your eye.	413.55767342933007
— _...	9.869859724632455
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?	33.2499103147932
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn ’ t and he couldn ’ t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he ’ d just take a cigar.	135.95428128988593
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him: — Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw! Arrah, bloody end to the paw he ’ d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.	325.9311850578831
And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn ’ t near roast him, it ’ s a queer story, the old one, Bloom ’ s wife and Mrs O ’ Dowd that kept the hotel.	277.00861079779435
From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance.	2911.043714669331
Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents.	2162.176470902849
That monster audience simply rocked with delight.	1584.9045004288523
A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.	1072.6957087364217
Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what ’ s waiting for me down Limehouse way.	581.7355099775849
Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap ’ s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators.	751.7889165520513
— Well, that ’ s a point, says Bloom, for the wife ’ s admirers.	37.949117030048704
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee ’ s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act.	434.37758937130616
True as you ’ re there.	52.34211101603389

— Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.	198.52412565650067
Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.	68.86656632309223
That ’ s well known.	28.710593229228472

— Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf.	142.55055760700216
It was a knockout clean and clever.	304.20760784099406
I hear he ’ s running a concert tour now up in the north.	104.72354654905573
That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal ’ s chest.	289.12961675669726
J.	9.522090257552765
Look at his head.	24.123972511901304
— That what ’ s I mean, says the citizen.	21.871232159468974
What?	14.626800461768257
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he ’ ll dissolve in tears on the bench.	390.4072037653438
And J.	36.06052442865209
And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world.	1660.7487790369985
— Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage.	915.7692347163611
All wind and piss like a tanyard cat.	519.9686208867673
— Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse.	41.125925031805195
And another one: _Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga_.	4023.2763164649796
Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.	180.68675810220373

There ’ s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo.	496.2440628903008
Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.	767.5586317436326
— That covers my case, says Joe.	105.3078986853895
I was born here.	45.677084712827465
— And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.	165.17655553993515

Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.	79.14793826448941
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.	619.6732543933837

A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom ’ s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás - Dugulás (Meadow of Murmuring Waters).	1465.4345609140205
Gob, the devil wouldn ’ t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen ’ s royal theatre: — Where is he till I murder him?	160.28137925849614

Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.	137.58582880531412
— Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.	126.00887293216738
— Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?	94.01411971929701
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning.	688.1475068670096
The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.	2096.2503994532476
He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.	949.4969125081955
It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer ’ s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.	675.8246950477832
The colours were done something lovely.	744.1614965212348
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty ’ s skirt near the little pool by the rock.	432.4450581381422
A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle.	509.4543618258442
She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks.	588.8522049449741
Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it: — Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.	3162.2484108103963
It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft.	331.3245051555407
The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him.	187.94802032640166
She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl ’ s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station.	462.20024769252416
Sister?	34.584020507668754
Cheap too.	134.45993462688702
And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice.	121.44297445280188
And I ’ ll write to you.	24.442278522140427
Molly often told me feel things a ton weight.	476.50321511480087
All are.	33.4535670617298
Took off her hat to show her hair.	135.56753557605813
Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she ’ s on for it: good evening.	157.1725509482513
Press the button and the bird will squeak.	663.7657668040924
Wish she hadn ’ t called me sir.	196.8139601374857
Cause of half the trouble.	418.75577583017684
Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly.	235.25794279959825
Fifteen she told me.	66.78108996909434
Lord mayor had his eye on her too.	129.98695051077118
Why that highclass whore in Jammet ’ s wore her veil only to her nose.	348.30130389608564
Neat way she carries parcels too.	859.7208648265548
A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles.	6999.047116513684
Keeps them out of harm ’ s way.	28.837194889944254
Bad policy however to fault the husband.	868.0706645931042
Sometimes children turn out well enough.	517.00437754993
Big he and little she.	180.5535794417873

For instance if you go into a cellar where it ’ s dark.	138.54585974183823
Vamp of her stockings.	431.57843748667653

Animals go by that.	423.491622099556
Ask yourself who is he now.	164.805111865429
And that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh.	153.88436108211084
Healthy perhaps absorb all the.	823.4236659872495
Old Betty ’ s joints are on the rack.	418.61143737454955

Bailey light.	555.4359387163456
No. Wait.	45.67778078560433
All quiet on Howth now.	294.5769884454836
O wait.	40.517436029241296
And the old major, partial to his drop of spirits.	271.03300074577373
Bat probably.	312.7132929376106
Their frugal meal.	1151.1828562356857
Wants to stamp his trademark on everything.	831.9643052919146
Say you never see them with three colours.	268.9758575515594
Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light.	602.3816489143111
That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling.	189.36741976767274
And says she and says he.	47.52903447854467
Calomel purge I got her for that.	597.0944416903284

Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines.	56.63446639331048
Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know.	267.3780465868774
Hopeless.	150.58104516500927
Ugly: no woman thinks she is.	324.9987648421557
Might be money.	60.69833141023453
Must come back.	29.966922310143094
What?	14.626800461768257
The stick fell in silted sand, stuck.	264.8380814807278
Just for a few Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	60.57446856446916
But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.	479.4860232579166
Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously?	1870.1973792342144
No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away.	352.0725765158025
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird - in - the - Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her.	490.08562445528815
To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul ’ s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip.	1890.8001483287314
From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.	682.9339506571239

Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on.	389.1377603029216
_Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.	4948.983127833187
My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment.	899.5706126583116
